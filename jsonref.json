Some venues are, however, planning to continue offering discounts once the scheme ends.According to Sky News, the Grosvenor Estate, which owns property in London’s West End, plans to cut rents for restaurants in its buildings that apply £10 per head discounts until the end of September.Visitor numbers to smaller cities and seaside towns have increased most as a result of the scheme, according to a study by the Centre for Cities thinktank. However, the continued absence of office workers from many big cities has meant places like London and Manchester have benefited least.Restaurants, bars and cafes were among the hardest hit businesses by lockdown, with a higher proportion of hospitality workers furloughed than in other sectors.Despite warnings that encouraging people to eat out would accelerate the spread of the virus, the scheme is designed to boost trade as the furlough scheme is wound down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f67852308c995d582d6b10e265a3b41ebbd9b2/332_1017_6653_3992/master/6653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75dfe0b379ae3a8f1e227fd78307b934","title":"uk post lockdown sofa sales surge says dfs","story":"Post-lockdown sales of sofas have surged at the retailer DFS Furniture, as people bought new furnishings after months confined to their homes.“The thing that has been a pleasant surprise for us has been that people seem to be switching their spend into home as opposed to holidays, or leisure, or fashion,” said the DFS chief executive, Tim Stacey.Demand for made-to-order sofas has led to longer waiting times, which have increased from an average of 4-6 weeks usually seen as this time of year to 11-12 weeks.“We have 1,000 people in the UK making sofas every day and we are flat out at the moment,” said Stacey.

An education source said: “She knew she’d reached the end of the line.”Collier had been conspicuous by her absence since the U-turn on results last week, with Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, issuing a public apology instead.Ofqual said she would be replaced temporarily by her predecessor, Dame Glenys Stacey, with additional support from the Ofsted chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, who previously chaired Ofqual. Taylor remains in his role.The chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, said Collier should still give evidence to his inquiry. “Just a few days ago, both Sally Collier and Roger Taylor confirmed they would come to the committee.“Taylor has confirmed to me today he will still attend but I hope very much Sally Collier will still attend because she was in charge at the time and we can find out what went wrong,” he told the . “The public, parents and pupils need to know the truth of what happened and why.” understands Ofqual was planning to send Stacey along with Taylor.Collier’s resignation comes days after the publication of millions of GCSE results and not long after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, insisted Ofqual had his “full confidence”. He had previously refused to back Collier but later admitted Ofqual was responsible for the climbdown for which he originally took credit.The government was forced to apologise for the fiasco that resulted in disadvantaged students being worst hit by downgrades, while private school pupils’ results were boosted under the algorithm. University admissions were thrown into chaos and public confidence in the exams system plummeted.A statement from Ofqual said the board had agreed to accept temporary support from the schools regulator, Ofsted, to help resolve outstanding issues with this summer’s GCSE, A-level and vocational qualifications, including appeals and autumn exams, as well as preparations for next year’s exam season.“The chief regulator, Sally Collier, has decided that the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership,” the statement said.“The Ofqual board supports Sally in this decision, and thanks her for her leadership and service over the past four years, which has included overseeing the successful introduction of an entirely new set of GCSEs and A-levels, and a new grading system.”Stacey will be the acting chief regulator until December, with support from a new committee to be chaired by Spielman.The committee will oversee the work of Ofqual until the end of the year. Additional Ofsted staff may be brought in during the autumn to support Ofqual’s work. It is understood Ofsted was only informed of developments on Tuesday.The statement concluded: “Taken together these arrangements will ensure that Ofqual has the extra capacity, support and oversight it needs both to tackle the remaining issues from this year’s awarding process and to ensure that next year’s arrangements command public confidence.”Williamson issued a statement thanking Collier and welcoming the new governance arrangements involving Ofsted. “This will make sure Ofqual can fully focus on the important functions it must deliver as the independent regulator for qualifications, examinations and assessments in England,” he said. “Moving forward, my department will continue to work closely with Ofqual’s leadership to deliver fair results and exams for young people.”Collier earned a £200,000 salary and led Ofqual for four years, having worked previously in procurement for the civil service as the chief executive of Crown Commercial Service, but faced criticism for her lack of background in education.“Someone had to go, but I really feel for her,” said one education insider. “She was given an impossible job. Gavin Williamson told her to limit grade inflation and give candidates the grades they deserved. This is a mutually incompatible direction. Of course the one person who should resign is clinging on for dear life, on his last legs, expiring slowly.”Collier’s departure will do little to ert attention from the fiasco. Taylor is engaged in a public row with the Royal Statistical Society, which raised concerns about the algorithm. revealed last week that Taylor threatened to quit unless Williamson publicly backed the exams regulator, and that Spielman was being lined up to shore up the body.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was sorry Collier was standing down and she was not entirely to blame. “We have worked well with her, and found her to be a highly intelligent, principled, and thoughtful person,” he said.“This move follows the failure of the statistical model that led to this year’s grading fiasco, but the fault is not hers alone. Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2ba91c551566b322ed043bf99f2bbbce001f90/0_38_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c18f316971feaa351c3eee81f23aa2","title":"teachers and parents share your thoughts on face coverings in uk schools coronavirus","story":"We want to hear whether you or your children will be wearing a face covering in school to reduce the spread of coronavirusSecondary school pupils in Scotland have been advised to wear face coverings if it is impossible to physically distance, from Monday.

Its embassy in Ecuador declared a “zero tolerance” policy towards illegal fishing, and this week it announced it was tightening the rules for its enormous flotilla with a series of new regulations.But with 325 of those 340 ships remaining off Ecuador, and local navy commander Darwin Jarrín saying last week that nearly half of those vessels had intermittently switched off their satellite communications – breaching the rules of the regional fisheries management organisation – the episode has shown how difficult it is for small nations to stand up to China’s distant fleet even when it descends on the archipelago that inspired Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.China’s vast fishing fleet, by far the world’s largest, has been overfishing seas much further from the world’s gaze than the islands known for their giant tortoises and iguanas. From West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea to the Korean peninsula, the fleet has moved into the waters of other countries – switching off transponders to avoid detection, depleting fish stocks and threatening food security for often poor coastal communities. In east Asia, fishing vessels may act as the vanguard of an aggressive geopolitical strategy aimed at asserting territorial claims.China’s new regulations this week include harsher penalties for companies and captains involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated – or IUU – fishing. But conservationists monitoring the Galápagos episode are sceptical.“Beyond this one-sided announcement, the problem remains the same,” says Pablo Guerrero, marine conservation director for WWF Ecuador. “These boats operate without observers on board, they do not return to port, they transship their catch to mother vessels, which land the catch at ports. So, in a nutshell, they are fishing all the time, the fishing operation doesn’t stop.”The fleet is a vast and complex network. Among the hundreds of vessels are fuel providers, fishing boats, tender boats and reefers, some of which camouflage unregistered boats, Guerrero says. Many ships spend long periods at sea where shocking human rights violations have been reported.NGO Global Fishing Watch and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) thinktank have used cutting-edge technology and data analysis to reveal that the size and scope of China’s distant-water fleet has been hugely underreported.The ODI found the fleet had 16,966 vessels, five times more than previous estimates. By contrast, the US distant-water fleet comprises 300 boats.In 2017, as part of its 13th fisheries five-year plan, China announced plans to cap the size of the fleet to 3,000 vessels by 2020.“We were shocked by the results because we were expecting 4,000 or 5,000 vessels,” says Miren Gutiérrez, the lead author of the ODI report.The research, which took more than a year, also found nearly 1,000 of the boats were using “flags of convenience” and at least 183 vessels were involved in suspected IUU fishing, for which China ranked the worst-performing nation in a 2019 global index.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.“Most of this overfishing is not illegal, that’s the problem,” Gutiérrez says, as most of it goes on in international waters. Most of the fleet’s vessels are trawlers – banned within China’s territorial waters and notorious for damaging  ecosystems by dragging nets along the seafloor. Other common boats are longliners, for larger fish such as tuna or shark, and squid-jiggers, which usually operate in deeper waters.China’s self-declared shake-up proposes changes to high-seas transshipment rules – the movement of cargo from one vessel to another – along with reforms to distant-water fishing. It also announced two three-month fishing moratoriums: one west of the Galápagos, between September and November, and another beginning in July in the south Atlantic near Argentina.The world’s biggest seafood exporter is also mooted to be planning to ratify the Port State Measures Agreement, the first internationally binding accord in which ports around the world pledge not to allow illegal or unregulated fishing boats to land catches.“It’s a significant concession,” says Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation. “But in the context of global fisheries it’s not enough, it’s not nearly enough.”Ecuador is one of a few small nation states that have pushed back against the Chinese flotillas. In the hotly disputed South China Sea, Indonesia sent F-16 fighter jets along with navy, coastguard and fishing boats to repel 63 Chinese fishing boats and four coastguard vessels from its waters in January.But North Korean fishing boats may have come off worse from exchanges with China’s “dark fleets”, amid reports of “ghost boats” washing up on Japanese shores containing the bodies of North Korean fishermen. In its backyard, the Chinese fleet has a fearsome reputation for systemic illegal fishing and aggressive tactics when faced with competitors or foreign patrol vessels.China signed a key UN fish stocks agreement in 1996 but never ratified it. It is a member of seven regional fishery management organisations, or RFMOs, but its distant water fleet operates outside of those frameworks, says Mercedes Rosello, director of House of Ocean, a not-for-profit legal consultancy that monitors IUU fishing.“When you are looking at thousands of vessels, the rules and mechanisms which that flag state adopts are of huge transcendence,” Rosello says.“The people who suffer first and worst are almost always the coastal communities who rely on those fisheries for their survival, wellbeing and food,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/befef7d394c8d6bb229f0df063691cf62ccac094/0_403_7846_4710/master/7846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344ed994b8426b84024cd872403a1f78","title":"special branches the nominations to be englands tree of the year in pictures","story":"A sycamore laced with the shoes of jubilant students, a haunted oak bound in chains and a Hackney plane facing the chop are among the 10 contenders to become England’s tree of the year.

Email feast@theWhat should I be making batches of now, while it’s still summer, to add flavour to my winter cooking?Ben, SouthportLife is always better when sweet tomatoes and peaches are at hand, so it’s eminently sensible to want to feel their love in the winter dearth, too. August and September are the golden months for preserving a summer glut, so fill your boots and get sterilising those jars.As to what you should be preserving, the short answer, says Kylee Newton, author of The Modern Preserver, is “whatever you can get your hands on”. Tomatoes, however, are a good place to start. She blanches them whole, then peels, cores and covers in a large pan with salted water and boils for five minutes. “Sterilise one-litre jars and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of sea salt to each,” Newton says, “then pack the still-hot jars with the drained, cooked tomatoes, leaving a 3cm space, cover with the hot cooking brine, 1cm from the rim, and seal with hot lids.”For longevity, Olia Hercules, author of Summer Kitchens, adds a little dash each of raw or good-quality vinegar and oil to jars of brine (25g salt to one litre water), garlic, allspice berries, dill and cherry tomatoes (this works with chillies and peppers, too). All tomatoes are welcome to Hercules’ preserving party: “Big, small, green or firm are also good, so if you’re growing them and they don’t ripen, not to worry.” These “flavour bombs” can then be used as a pickle, blitzed up into a sauce, added to broths (“to give acidity”) or, my personal favourite, “as a snack with vodka”.Courgettes are another go-to for Hercules: “They’re fantastic grated, or sliced thinly, and added to caramelised onions. Just cook it all down until it turns into a paste.” She stores in jars with a little oil on top, then uses as a pasta sauce, in stews, or simply spread on toast.“Stone fruits are also amazing,” Eagle says. “You can cook, dry, freeze or bottle them.” A sweet pickle, though, comes out tops: “Make a syrup but with vinegar – half sugar, half mild cider vinegar – then cook the prepared fruit in that for 30 seconds to a minute, or pour it hot over cherries and leave to steep.” The result? Sweet pickled fruit that’s mild enough to use in desserts but tangy enough to sit alongside cold meats and cheese. “You’ve also got the sweet vinegar, which you can use as a shrub for cordials and cocktails,” Eagle notes.Hercules is also a fan of stone fruit. “In Ukraine, we’re big on preserving peaches whole,” she says. “They’re so easy: make a sugar syrup. add interesting herbs such as lemon verbena or vanilla, then poach them whole. You’re basically making tinned peaches.” Her top serving tip: slice and add to a homemade cake with cream, or folded into the batter. Sounds just, er, peachy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Graham Hansen gets forward for Barcelona, galloping into the Wolfsburg penalty area and shooting over the bar from a fairly tight angle. Not long now: The teams are out, going through the last of the pre-match formalities. Barcelona’s players wear ... the colours of Barcelona. The players of Wolfsburg wear green shirts, shorts and socks. The big news of the night is that Barcelona’s star Dutch midfielder Lieke Martens has been dropped in favour of Mariona Caldentex. Wolfsburg go in to tonight’s match as heavy favourites, but Barcelona’s manager Lluis Cortes is confident is team can cause an upset, writes Sid Lowe from San Sebastian. “We hope that the game will be entertaining,” said Lluis Cortes. “There are good players among us, and Wolfsburg we are prepared for in all areas of the pitch. We have seen that the defence and goalkeepers are very important for us. We are prepared ourselves not to concede against any opponent, we are well-drilled.”“Our focus has been to recharge the batteries and be more fresh,” said Stephan Lerch. “We’ve taken advantage of the time being outside a bit, fresh air, taking a walk and training, and the team and the players are good, all available, and I think that we have benefitted from the time in recent days to recharge the batteries, now we will take time to focus on the match.”The Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastian is the venue for the first of the mid-week semi-finals in the Women’s Champions League, with the winners advancing to Sunday’s final.Two-times winners Wolfsburg smashed Glasgow City 9-1 in the last round, while Barcelona booked their place in the last four with a narrow win over Atletico Madrid.The winners of tonight’s game will face French opposition in the final, with Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon preparing to duke it out in tomorrow’s other semi-final. Kick-off in the Basque Country is at 7pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b26f8813344aec623dee28ba1b5595fe97a5209/0_380_2430_1458/master/2430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4dcbfd4d5ae91b78ed41c82a5caae83","title":"gardening tips plant globe thistles for pollinators","story":"Then read up on growing your own food on a window ledge, and separate strawberry runnersPlant this In late summer, globe thistles (aka Echinops) are delightful nectar bars for pollinators, but after a season or two they turn into hulking plants not suitable for the average border.

Now a more positive story is emergingShortly before the infamous 1970 Isle of Wight festival, Stanley Dunmore, a local public health inspector, worried about “a possible breakdown of public order … if the festival is a failure, or falls short of expectations, or the weather is bad, or facilities which the fans expect to find in the town are not available”.His observations, made when music festivals were in their infancy, confirm some things that we know about them today – if only Billy McFarland and Ja Rule had read Dunmore’s report before the spectacular failure of Fyre festival. These events are complex and expensive to coordinate, especially in remote settings with inebriated and underprepared crowds cowed by the weather. If things go wrong, disaster can ensue.Isle of Wight 1970 became the British festival that we associate with disaster. The myth goes that a group of young men, out to make a few quid from youthful music fans, put on the largest-ever pop festival in Britain at the time. To protect their investment and rake in gate receipts, they erected fencing around the site to contain the crowd of 600,000 and exclude troublemakers. Building on a few references in the press, the popular image is of radicals and French anarchists flooding down from Desolation Hill, which overlooked the festival site, and ripping down the fencing. In a recent article on Joni Mitchell’s performance, the  reported that “fights broke out, objects were thrown, and a lot of bad acid was taken”.But it is easy to get the wrong impression about the 1970 festival. It has been mythologised and attacked for personal and political reasons, but against most criteria other than finances (a £40,000-£60,000 loss), the evidence that I unearthed for my first book reveals a beguiling and misunderstood story. It suggests the festival was not as bad as it seems – in fact, at the time some saw it as the British Woodstock.The first Isle of Wight festival, in 1968, attracted about 8,000 festivalgoers to Hell Field near Godshill. Three Labour-supporting brothers in their early 20s brought to the island from Derbyshire during childhood, Ray, Bill and Ronald Foulk, instigated the festival to raise funds to build a municipal indoor swimming pool.The 1969 festival exceeded their wildest expectations. Bob Dylan, who had hardly played live since his motorbike accident in 1966, attracted the world’s media and 80,000 to 100,000 festivalgoers. Ray Foulk says the 1969 festival was not without hiccups – he told me that “the catering was not adequate we were ripped off and the public were”, and a lack of toilets led to long queues. But the promoters learned on their feet and overcame these problems good weather did not test the amenities at the site, now in Wootton. There was a headline performance from the Who, and Dylan’s appearance was a culturally significant moment – a pilgrimage – for the postwar generation.It teed up the 1970 festival, one of the largest outdoor gatherings in Britain since the war, even if the figure of 600,000 is probably an overestimate. The event might not have taken place if local councillors, well-connected islanders and their Conservative MP, Mark Woodnutt, had had their way. In letters to the environment department, Woodnutt argued that the festival could cause a polio epidemic (the island had suffered one in 1949) and that the 1969 festival had “left a scene of indescribable filth”. However, he would need a high court injunction to stop the festival, and proof that the festival was a threat to public and environmental health rather than simply a nuisance.Mindful of a a possible injunction, the Foulks’ company Fiery Creations reminded the council of the lack of trouble during the 1969 festival and the good publicity the island received because of the event. Dunmore, the health inspector, and Douglas Quantrill, the island’s chief medical officer, alleviated sanitation and safety fears, and helped coordinate organisations from macrobiotic caterers to National Rail.Without legal recourse, local pressure groups and councillors disingenuously claimed the island lacked suitable sites for a large festival and pressured landowners into refusing to rent land. The East Afton site was only agreed in early August, weeks before the festival opened at the start of the bank holiday. The valley, flanked by a hill on National Trust property and near idyllic beaches below white cliffs, would soon host a stage, 20 turnstiles, 66 food and drink stalls, 500 toilets and 600 feet of urinals.Reports from the time, and footage, suggest that the crowd witnessed some stunning performances. The lineup included the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, the Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Sly and the Family Stone and Gilberto Gil Jimi Hendrix played one of his last performances before his death. Recently rediscovered photographs taken by Peter Bull show calm and content festivalgoers, who resemble their contemporary counterparts aside from their attire, lack of mobile phones and the fact that they’re nearly all sitting down.There were disturbances, though. A group, no more than 200 of those camping on Desolation Hill, attempted to break down the perimeter wall the day before the festival began. Later, on Sunday morning, organisers and audience argued when security cleared the inner arena for Jethro Tull’s soundcheck and to check tickets. At 4pm on Sunday afternoon, MC Rikki Farr declared the festival free (to the horror of Ray Foulk who was standing in the crowd) and, after the announcement, the inner arena wall was dismantled from the inside by ticket holders, prompting a queue of concerned workers and creditors seeking immediate payment backstage. There were 117 arrests for possession of drugs.Conflicts do not feature prominently in the official record, however. Douglas Osmond, the chief constable of Hampshire police, dressed up like a hippy and went incognito on Desolation Hill for a day. He claimed to see less violence than at a typical football match and concluded that “people become unduly anxious about these gatherings”.Every national newspaper reported on the festival, with some of them, glad for news in August, printing extensive coverage. These generally positive reports were punctuated by scurrilous stories about sex and drugs, outraged locals and photographs of nude (mostly female) bodies. The Sunday Mirror’s account explained: “This isn’t quite paradise. But if you are young and can look after yourself and the sun stays out and the music stays loud, it doesn’t matter.”It is interesting, then, that a view of the festival as a disaster has come to dominate. Organisers blame the late documentary film-maker Murray Lerner. Fiery Creations and Lerner wanted to emulate the success of the 1970 Woodstock documentary, which took just under $50m at the US box office, but their Isle of Wight film did not find a distributor until 1997 and the delay caused acrimony. Ray Foulk, particularly in the second volume of his book When the World Came to the Isle of Wight, and Peter Harrigan, Fiery Creations’ publicist, allege that Lerner removed footage of isolated incidents of trouble from their context and spliced them between performances for drama. For instance, Lerner’s documentary edited the footage of arguments in the main arena on Sunday morning to include shots of some drunken jeering and stray beers thrown at a lighting tower. The film exaggerates the intensity, significance and extent of either disturbance. It was, Foulk said, “complete fakery” and “besmirched not just the festival but a whole generation of people”. Indeed, he argues that the festival was only declared free to benefit Lerner’s documentary in the first place.The organisers also made the mistake of inviting International Times (IT), a London-based countercultural paper, to view the site under construction. As head of the British White Panthers, its editor, Mick Farren, published communiques in pamphlets and IT that encouraged resistance. He saw the increased price (to £3, about the price of a double album) and security as an affront to his left-libertarian view that music festivals should be free, and claimed that the fences, security dogs and turnstiles evoked prison camps.After losing £6,000 on their own free festival a month before, Phun City near Worthing, the 1970 Isle of Wight festival provided Farren and his peers a chance for some agitprop myth-making to champion the radical underground. Take Jean-Jacques Lebel, the only one of the “French anarchists” that can be identified from the festival despite that phrase recurring in several accounts – thanks to his involvement in the counterculture, Lebel could amplify his role in the festival’s mythology and its political significance through the underground press.Farren’s fear about repression and exploitation were not misplaced, but misdirected. The idea that festivals had radical potential, alongside stigma concerning festivalgoers’ propriety, took hold, and exacerbated the anxieties and prejudices of conservative Isle of Wight residents. The county council had received calls to stop pop festivals since 1969 – one letter described festivalgoers as “social parasites” – and following the 1970 event Woodnutt introduced legislation to prevent another festival on the island. The council now had complete discretion over licenses for overnight events with a crowd over 5,000, and organisers would have to give four months’ notice. Subsequently, there were no further festivals there there until 2002.Other rural areas wanted similar control and Conservative MP Jerry Wiggin’s Night Assemblies Bill offered it. The bill proposed criminalising any outdoor gathering of 1,000 people or more between midnight and 6am unless the organisers applied to a local authority at least four months before and provided financial guarantees.The bill did not, however, define the “pop festival” clearly and therefore threatened the right to free assembly. The National Council for Civil Liberties argued it would “stifle political opinion and prevent activity at a time when too much emphasis is being put upon law and order at the expense of justice and liberty”, and the bill failed.It exposed, though, tension between young people, the counterculture and rural British conservatism. The vitriol aimed at pop festivals, and the types of social change that they were seen to represent, is startling. Great Western festivals ran into to trouble, for instance, in Tollesbury, Essex, in 1972 when trying to find a festival site (it ultimately settled on Bardney, Lincolnshire). The local villagers burned effigies of the organisers, Lord Harlech and the actor Stanley Baker – the type of hip capitalists that countercultural radicals also feared. A local explained that this was because the festival would cause the “sheer rape of our way of life”. The panic over festivals became a trope for bored reporters in the summertime and justification for heavy-handed policing, as those brutally attacked by Thames Valley police at the Windsor free festival in 1974 will attest.Quantrill, meanwhile, became a public health celebrity, if there is such a thing. Councils sought him out for advice on festivals and at the Royal Society of Health Symposium in 1971 he argued, in what became a widely circulated paper, that there was little risk in a reasonably well-planned festival such as the Isle of Wight 1970. The government select committee issued an official code of practice to guide local authorities and festival organisers, undermining “anarchic” or free festivals by giving local authorities clearer grounds for injunctions if a festival did not meet the code’s expensive recommendations. Without significant capital and a willing council, it made it harder for enthusiastic amateurs such as Fiery Creations to run a festival, leaving rural landowners and posh hipsters increasingly in charge.When you attend the modern-day music festival, however, you are, in a sense, stepping into a world made by three brothers, their friends and a handful of kindly civil servants.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

It’s demeaning … it’s unhealthy.”A British Gymnastics spokesman confirmed that several other allegations against Reddin were being looked at and that Reddin had agreed to temporarily step aside from her role as head national coach “to allow an investigation to proceed into claims about her conduct as a coach”.A statement from British Gymnastics added: “The investigation will be completed by an external independent expert and any outcome actioned immediately.”In a separate development the Rio 2016 Olympic bronze medallist Amy Tinkler used social media on Tuesday to launch an attack on British Gymnastics after the governing body dismissed her formal complaint against Reddin, saying she felt “sick” at the outcome – and warning it would discourage other gymnasts from speaking out.Tinkler, who had been awaiting the outcome of a dual complaint about bullying at her former club South Durham as well as Reddin’s coaching methods for the past eight months, said she had been told via email that the part of her case involving Reddin had been closed.“The way I received this information made me sick,” claimed Tinkler, the youngest member of Team GB in Rio when, aged 16, she finished third in the floor exercise behind the American gymnasts Simone Biles and Aly Raisman.“It reinforced mine and every gymnasts’ fear, which is that their complaints aren’t dealt with fairly and independently,” Tinkler wrote. “This is why we don’t speak up. This is why we suffer in silence. We know that to speak up is a pointless, career-ending task.”British Gymnastics confirmed that an investigation into Tinkler’s complaint about South Durham Gymnastics Club is ongoing.Team GB gymnasts finished the Rio Olympic Games with seven medals across all three gymnastics disciplines, making it their most successful Games to date – with Reddin, who had been national coach since 2012, taking a large share of the credit.However since then a number of the team have spoken out about physical and mental abuse in the British system, including the world championship medallists Becky and Ellie Downie who said “cruel” behaviour was “so ingrained in our daily lives that it became completely normalised” – although they did not mention any coaches by name.Meanwhile the British Olympian Francesca Fox said she was constantly told she “looked like a hippo” while the four-time Olympic medallist Louis Smith accused British Gymnastics of not wanting to taint its image by alerting the public to complaints made against coaches.On Tuesday UK Sport and Sport England announced that an independent review into abuse in gymnastics at all levels of the sport in Britain between 2008 and 2020 would be led by the QC Anne Whyte. It added the review would look into:• Whether gymnasts’ wellbeing and welfare is (and has been) at the centre of the culture of British Gymnastics, its registered clubs and member coaches and if not, why not.• Whether safeguarding concerns and complaints have been dealt with appropriately in the sport of gymnastics and if not, why not.• Whether gymnasts, or their parents, carers or s, have felt unable to raise complaints with appropriate authorities and if so, why.On Monday it was also reported that a historical charge against Reddin, who is due to lead the women’s gymnastics team to next year’s Games in Tokyo, had not been substantiated.The BBC said a gymnast called Jenny, who had been coached by Reddin at the Bright School of Gymnastics in the 1980s, told BBC Sport that she had been slapped and verbally abused by the coach.In its written response seen by the , British Gymnastics said Reddin had categorically denied slapping gymnasts, saying she would only give “little taps and nibbles” to show gymnasts how they should be working. It also said she denied using “excessive force” on a gymnast to stretch them.“In considering this, the Case Management Team determined that it was not possible to substantiate the allegations based on the time passed,” it added. ”They noted that this does not mean the allegation is considered proven or not proven, but that it is not possible to make a determination either way.”Speaking before the investigation against her was launched, Reddin said: “I completely refute the historical claim, and the investigation by British Gymnastics did not uphold the complaint. I completely refute these claims, it is wrong that my reputation within the sport that I love is now subject to a trial by media rather than through the proper processes.“I would welcome the allegations be submitted to the independent review into alleged abuse in gymnastics to ensure the integrity of the process is protected for both athletes and coaches.” understands that GB Gymnastics’ performance director, James Thomas, will take over Reddin’s role while the investigation is carried out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72675795093d800ce69286c3f9425329f345137/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=df0baef9ca914ac9d405833f574a3a86","title":"england v pakistan third test day five live","story":"James Anderson reached an astonishing milestone on another rain-affected day as England won a series against Pakistan for the first time in 10 yearsThat’s it for today’s blog and for a seriously uplifting summer of Test cricket. Thanks for your company and emails throughout goodnight!“I feel like I can still bowl in all conditions. I feel like I’m fit enough to keep playing. I realise there will be times when I’ll be left out I’ll just try to keep my game at as high a level as possible.”As with Stuart Broad’s 500th earlier in the summer, Sky have done another spectacular job on their congratulatory montage. Ah, apparently it was the ECB’s doing because of the Covid restrictions. “That was lovely, thank you very much, I really enjoyed that.”Jimmy is getting emotional he looks like he could go any second. “Family is a huge part of being successful at whatever job you do. For us, we’re away for so much time and that support is so importnat. I’m very lucky that I’ve got an amazing family and friends. At the start of summer we weren’t expecting to play much cricket at all it’s frustrating not having a crowd here but we’d much rather be out there than not.”The Men of the Series are the two keepers, Jos Buttler and Mohammad Rizwan. That can’t have happened too often before.Here are the averages from this summer’s Tests. A few highlights:England’s series win is their first against Pakistan since 2010. That audacious partnership between Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes was even more important than we realised at the time, as rain wrecked the rest of the series. There was still time for some exhilarating vignettes in the last two games at Southampton. As rain-ruined three-Test series go, this was a cracker.After one ball of the last hour, the players on both sides shake hands and agree a draw. England have won the series 1-0, Jimmy Anderson is 600 not out, and everyone seems happy with life. The Pakistan team, who have contributed enormously to the series, all line up to shake Anderson’s hand as he leads the team off the field. It’s nice, if a little unnerving, to see such goodwill between the cricket teams of England and Pakistan.83rd over: Pakistan 187-4 (Babar 63, Fawad 0) Babar hits consecutive boundaries off Anderson, the first through square leg and the second past Bess at point. Fawad, still on nought, is beaten later in the over by a cracking outswinger. “A peach of a delivery from the great man,” says Wasim Akram on Sky.Imagine having such swing-bowling prowess that you are called ‘the great man’ by Wasim Akram.82nd over: Pakistan 178-4 (Babar 54, Fawad 0) Broad has an LBW appeal against Babar turned down by Michael Gough, and that’s the end of the conversation. Replays showed the angle, from wider on the crease, was taking it past leg stump. We’ll have plenty on Jimmy Anderson’s achievement later today. In the meantime, why not revisit this majestic piece of writing from Mike Selvey?81st over: Pakistan 175-4 (Babar 53, Fawad 0) Jimmy Anderson is back for more, armed with the second new ball, and his first delivery swings encouragingly. Babar clips three through midwicket, which allows Anderson two deliveries at the new batsman Fawad Alam. It’s not enough. It’s never enough.80th over: Pakistan 172-4 (Babar 50, Fawad 0) The ball before Shafiq’s dismissal, Babar reached a smooth, stylish fifty from 80 deliveries. He’s faced 80 balls, the team have faced 80 overs, so it’s time for the second new ball.This game isn’t done yet. Shafiq pushes forward at Root and gets a thick inside edge towards short leg, where the substitute James Bracey takes a smart low catch.79th over: Pakistan 170-3 (Babar 49, Asad 20) One more over until the second new ball is available.78th over: Pakistan 166-3 (Babar 48, Asad 18) Dom Sibley is coming on to bowl his very occasional legspin. It must be the last day of term. He starts with a vile half-tracker that Shafiq cuts for a two, and it gets worse from there. The second ball is a full toss, the next a no-ball thankfully Sibley settles down after that and completes an interesting over.In the meantime, this is excellent news.77th over: Pakistan 161-3 (Babar 48, Asad 15) Babar is tucking in to the spinners. He cuts Bess for four and then charges down the track to k another boundary. Brilliant batting.“Dear Rob,” says Boris Starling. “Not to cast aspersions on the IQ of The Greatest Living Yorkshireman™️, but I like the way that Sir Geoffrey ‘consulted a statistician’ to extrapolate how many wickets Fiery Fred would have got these days, rather than spend less than 10 seconds on his iPhone calculator doing a very simple piece of maths (307 ided by 67, times 156).”As if he has an iPhone, never mind one with a “calculator”.76th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Babar 38, Asad 15) Four more to Babar, waves easily to third man off Root. 75th over: Pakistan 146-3 (Babar 33, Asad 15) Another quiet over from Bess, who has been played expertly by the Pakistan batsmen throughout this series.74th over: Pakistan 146-3 (Babar 33, Asad 15) Babar works Root just short of the substitute Bracey at short leg. That would have been a helluva bonus for England, who still have an outside chance of doing something silly with the second new ball. 73rd over: Pakistan 144-3 (Babar 31, Asad 15) “One year ago today I was in the Hampstead Men’s Pond changing room,” says Zander Woollcombe. “With victory getting closer the number of scantily clad men crowding around a small portable radio in silence grew from two to five. As it was a scorching Sunday afternoon the pond was rammed with people queuing, screaming and splashing their frivolity in marked contrast with the seriousness of those of us who cared about the cricket and hid from the rest of the mob under the shade of an oak tree between the ing board and the toilet cubicle. “I had left my girlfriend with our six-month-old son saying I would have a quick dip and be back in time to give him supper and a bath. When I set off for the Heath I’d assumed it would all be over by the time I got there but had timed my swim carefully so that if the miracle did happen it would come while I was due at the pond.“Weirdly, after only three hours sleep a night for months I felt serenely confident that Stokes and Leach would do it. To the horror of my fellow listeners I went for a leisurely swim when 40 were needed and by the time I got back it was under 10. I listened to the winning runs, sat on the grass and did a quick meditation, was only a bit late for looking after my son.”72nd over: Pakistan 142-3 (Babar 31, Asad 13) Joe Root brings himself into the attack in an attempt to kill some overs before the second new ball. He runs back to his mark before each delivery, only for Babar to put some time back into the game by driving delightfully over wide mid-on for four.“Beautifully played in over 58, Mr Smyth: taking the blame, then linking to a page showing your old mucker Sean Ingle making the ‘Jimmy Anderson, Attack Leader’ references,” says Tom Paternoster-Howe. “That was as subtle and elegant as Anderson switching from an inswinger to an outswinger.”Alas, Sean did the first session and then I did the rest. LOOK, PATERNOSTER-HOWE, STOP TRYING TO TAKE THE CREDIT AWAY FROM ME! I WAS THE ARROGANT KNOW-NOTHING PRICK! 70th over: Pakistan 136-3 (Babar 27, Asad 11) Nothing much is happening. It’s a bright evening in Southampton, so play could go on for a while yet. Thus, it’s time for drinks.69th over: Pakistan 133-3 (Babar 26, Asad 9) Babar plays a terrific cover drive for four off Bess. It’s been an increasingly difficult summer for Bess, though he does look like a fast learner. A tour or two of the subcontinent early next year, Covid permitting, will continue his education.“Can you please enlighten a newcomer to the OBO?” says Frank Entwistle. “When I saw ‘Live’, I assumed you were in the media centre at the ground. But now you say you’re not there. How does it work?”‘Live’ just means that it’s happening now. When it started (2002) it was office-based and that has continued. It’s cheaper and also separates it from the proper journalism that appears in the paper. Some freelancers do it from the ground these days though. 68th over: Pakistan 128-3 (Babar 22, Asad 8) Stuart Broad replaces Jimmy Anderson, who has match figures of 41-6-89-7. The rest of the England bowlers have taken 5-294 between them.“My memory goes back to 1963 and I would have to agree with a certain G Boycott that the number one for me is Fred Trueman,” says Alan McClean. “He asked a statistician what his haul would be if he matched Anderson’s tally of 156 Tests and he came up with 715. And Fred had the greatest fast-bowling action of all.”One thing against our Fred is that he never bowled in a Test in Asia, though there’s no reason why he wouldn’t have succeeded. More to the point, it’s a perfect excuse to repost this clip.67th over: Pakistan 126-3 (Babar 20, Asad 8) Dom Bess replaces Jofra Archer, whose excellent figures (14-8-14-0) don’t tell much of a sstory. Babar bottom edges a cut past slip for four, and that’s that.“Great work by J.M. Anderson,” says Stuart Newstead. “Looking down your OBO list of some of his milestone wickets, and now the 600th, all were bowled, LBW or caught in the slips. I wonder if he’s been bowling to a plan for a while?”Heh. That brings to mind Glenn McGrath’s five-for at Old Trafford during the 2005 Ashes. England were chasing a declaration, and McGrath’s fifth was Ian Bell caught at long off. The disgusted look on his face suggested he was seriously considering a request to have it struck from the record books.66th over: Pakistan 121-3 (Babar 15, Asad 8) Anderson continues, though he looks very stiff. He should have walked straight off the field after taking Azhar’s wicket, unfurling a cigar as he approached the boundary edge.65th over: Pakistan 119-3 (Babar 14, Asad 7) In theory England still have 33 overs to win the match, 18 of them with a new ball. But the light will be an issue at some stage, so don’t get too excited. We’ve had our feelgood quota for the day.64th over: Pakistan 117-3 (Babar 12, Asad 7) “All the talk about Anderson recently got me thinking about great England pace bowlers,” says Steve Hudson. “My memory goes back to 1976, and if I think of pace bowlers who could, at some point in their career, be called a great bowler, the usual names came up - Willis, Botham, Fraser, Gough, Harmison, Flintoff, Broad, Archer etc etc. All of those, on their day, looked almost impossible to play. As does Jimmy, but he, alone, has been scarcely ever less than a great bowler for ten years now. He is astonishingly consistently brilliant, and that for me means he is the best England pace bowler I’ve ever seen.”Yes, nicely put. Others were scarier at their peak - Flintoff, Harmison, Archer - but Anderson’s has been close to his peak for a decade. He’s proof that sometimes, with truly great bowlers, even form is permanent. One of the most interesting things is that his last five years have been his best, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if he ploughs on to 700 or even 709. Murali’s 800 might be beyond him unless he goes on the Darren Stevens diet. 63rd over: Pakistan 112-3 (Babar 12, Asad 3) A maiden from Archer to who cares.62nd over: Pakistan 112-3 (Babar 11, Asad 3) Thing is, most people would be happy to go home now. Not Anderson. This sick bugger will be eyeing another victory, so that the wickets he’s taken here can be added to the 323. For all his skill - and he has a wrist for which most fast bowlers would make a Faustian pact - his mental strength and competitive energy are off the charts.We celebrate the Fab Four that won the Ashes in 2005, and quite right too. They took 748 Test wickets between them Anderson, an unhappy understudy in that series, has 600 on his own. It’s a bonkers achievement.Longevity has been always been a slippery concept to appreciate. Some of us even keep forgetting how to pronounce it. On the one hand it is quantifiable – 156 Tests, 17 years, 600 Test wickets – but on another it doesn’t come with an emoji. It does not go viral it does not leave people high on sport. But it does something more important: it separates the greats from the immortals.Jimmy Anderson has reached the mother of all milestones: 600 Test wickets, the first time a fast bowler has achieved the feat. Azhar Ali was surprised by some extra bounce and fenced the ball towards slip, where Root took a good catch above his head. It’s a crazy achievement, one that might not make sense for another decade or so. Of the 600 wickets, Anderson will cherish 323 the most – the ones that came in England victories, that he could celebrate behind closed doors with his mates. Anderson knows his value, how could he not, but he’s never been in it for inidual achievements. It’s a good job, or he’d have a head the size of Lancashire.61st over: Pakistan 109-2 (Azhar 31, Babar 11) Babar jumps back in his crease to crack Archer down the ground for three, another classy and confident stroke. He is so good that his series numbers - 140 at 35 - feel like a huge letdown. “Root has had several hours to think about tactics for the restart so it’s a bit disappointing to see Archer being forced to hammer it in short in the very first over,” says Mark Ferris. “What a waste of a talent! The cricket equivalent of lumping long balls up the field in the hope Andy Carroll gets on the end of one.”60th over: Pakistan 105-2 (Azhar 30, Babar 8) Anderson continues to bowl very straight to Babar, who defends solidly. When he gets a bit of width later in the over, he drives elegantly through the covers for three. The old ball is doing nothing, so Anderson may have to wait until the second new ball - due after 80 overs - for his big moments.“Is any sport as risk-averse as cricket?” says Gary Naylor. “Does anyone seriously believe that it was just too dangerous to play an hour (even two hours) ago? Players aren’t children - they would have to take a little more care in the field, but they could. Don’t forget that these fragile creatures voluntarily e headfirst at the boundary advertising hoardings to save a run - or please a coach - all day every day.”You might be right about today I’m not there so I can’t say. But if the entitled chatter of recent days continues, somebody will eventually get hurt. I’m not saying that’s completely wrong – you can’t ban cars and all that – but I do think we need to be careful. If Dom Bess says conditions were “seriously dangerous” the other night, that should give everyone pause.59th over: Pakistan 102-2 (Azhar 30, Babar 5) Archer continues to ram bouncers into the middle of the pitch, most of which are ignored by Azhar and Babar. Another maiden, as if that’s a good thing. England’s use of Archer is more than a little puzzling.58th over: Pakistan 102-2 (Azhar 30, Babar 5) James Anderson starts at the other end - it would have been a helluva time for Joe Root to show who’s boss and throw the ball to Dom Bess - with a subcontinent field: men on the drive, wicket-to-wicket etc. A quiet over, two from it.“Hi Rob,” says Tom Paternoster-Howe. “All this (justified) adulation for Jimmy Anderson’s bowling achievements over the past 17 years have got me reminiscing a bit, and I’m sure I remember the OBO coverage referring, somewhat disdainfully, to ‘Attack leader Jimmy Anderson’ for a Test, or even a series, after the coach or bowling coach at the time (this would have been in 2008 or 2010ish, I guess) said in an interview before a tour that he wanted Anderson to be the attack leader. I can’t seem to find it online though. Have I just dreamed it or did it really happen?” Yeah, that was me, thinking I knew it all. Not sure it was a whole series but from memory it was during the 2009 Ashes. Until the 2010-11 Ashes I thought he was a rough-track bully. It’s nice to be so emphatically wrong. We do get some things right, though – I saw Stuart Broad during a T20 match in 2006 and told anyone who’d listen that he’d take 200 Test wickets. It seemed a lot back then.57th over: Pakistan 100-2 (Azhar 29, Babar 4) Archer starts with a few harmless bouncers to Azhar Ali, bowled first from around and then back over the wicket. A maiden, and it’s on with the show at the other end.“I was glued to TMS feeling every ball,” says Neil Parkes of the Headingley miracle a year ago today. “Crucially though, I was listening through iPlayer on my phone with an indeterminate lag to the real event. Just as Leach was hurrying to his one crucial run to tie the score the effing  pinged me an alert with ‘Ben Stokes wins the Headingley Test for England’.

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.The recent agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to normalise relations was in part driven by a joint animus towards Iran, but the UK has refused to abandon the nuclear agreement partly in the hope that it can renegotiated and revived after the US elections in November.Raab also met the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in Jerusalem on Monday night where the British were again tackled over their support for the Iran deal.The timing made for an awkward backdrop for the two-day visit to Jerusalem by Raab, who has always prized close relations with the US, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Raab welcomed the rapprochement between Israel and the UAE as an important moment, especially since it includes an agreement by Netanyahu to suspend plans to annex the West Bank, seen by the British as a threat to a negotiated two-state solution.The agreement has also been criticised for potentially making it harder to negotiate a comprehensive peace settlement since Israel will feel under even less exterior pressure to negotiate with the Palestinians.Raab later travelled to Ramallah where he will meet the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.Raab said: “Israel’s suspension of annexation is an essential step towards a more peaceful Middle East. It is important to build on this new dynamic, and ultimately only the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority can negotiate the two-state solution required to secure lasting peace.”The Israeli foreign minister said that when it came to Iran some UN security council members were undermining world security.“The E3 must understand that genuine opposition to Iranian aggression and concern for the security of the region can not only be heard in statements but must also be seen in action,” he said.Ashkenazi pointed out that Iran’s response to the announced normalisation between the United Arab Emirates and Israel was to threaten the UAE with an attack.Netanyahu, who met Raab later, had described the EU decision as “absurd and outrageous”.The US last Thursday invoked “snapback sanctions”, which are meant to automatically extend the embargo without the support of the security council. The E3, Russia and China wrote letters to the UN secretariat saying the US does not have the right to do so, because it left the the Iran deal in 2018. Meanwhile, in Tehran, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the UN’s nuclear weapons inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency, met Iranian officials to discuss improved access for his inspectors to Iran’s nuclear sites. The talks, separate to lifting to the UN conventional arms embargo, have centred on IAEA access to two Iranian nuclear sites that have been blocked for months. The talks appeared to have made progress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/104fb54a4436a2440f862a117fcfe48604e39721/0_66_4814_2889/master/4814.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e522fe37bad08e55f42e780a3a4ead4f","title":"tropical storm laura hurricane texas louisiana gulf coast","story":"Major storm heads to US after killing two dozen on the island of Hiiola, 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican RepublicHundreds of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate the Gulf coast on Tuesday, as Laura strengthened into a hurricane that forecasters said could slam into Texas and Louisiana as a major storm with ferocious winds and deadly flooding.Laura passed Cuba after killing nearly two dozen on the island of Hiiola, 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.More than 385,000 were told to flee the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and still more were ordered to evacuate low-lying south-western Louisiana, where forecasters said as much as 13ft of storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire communities.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) projected that Laura would become a category 3 hurricane before making landfall late on Wednesday or early on Thursday, with winds of around 115mph capable of inflicting devastating damage.“The waters are warm enough everywhere there to support a major hurricane, category 3 or even higher. The waters are very warm where the storm is now and will be for the entire path up until the Gulf coast,” the NHC deputy director, Ed Rappaport, said.Ocean water was expected to push on to land along more than 450 miles of coast from Texas to Mississippi. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and storm surge warnings from the Port Arthur, Texas, flood protection system to the mouth of the Mississippi River.As of Tuesday morning, Laura was 585 miles south-east of Lake Charles, Louisiana, traveling north-west at 16mph. Its peak winds were 75mph. The NHC nudged its forecast track a bit farther west as computer simulations pushed the storm closer to Texas.There was little to keep Laura from turbocharging. Nearly all forecasts showed rapid strengthening at some point in the next couple of days.The deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic reportedly included a 10-year-old girl whose home was hit by a tree and a mother and young son crushed by a wall.On top of storm surge that could penetrate miles inland, as much as 15in of rain could fall in some parts of Louisiana, said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana, near the bullseye of Laura’s projected path.Marco, a system that approached land ahead of Laura, weakened into a remnant just off Louisiana’s shore. Satellite images showed a disorganized cluster of clouds, what meteorologists call “a naked swirl”, Jones said.But Laura powered up. The crew of a hurricane hunter plane confirmed that Laura became a hurricane with top winds of 75mph shortly after passing between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.The NHC warned people not to focus on the details of the official forecast since storm surge, wind and heavy rain will extend far from Laura’s center.In Galveston and Port Arthur, mandatory evacuation orders went into effect at 6am. People planning on entering official shelters were told to bring just one bag of personal belongings each, and a mask to reduce the spread of coronavirus.“If you decide to stay, you’re staying on your own,” Port Arthur’s mayor, Thurman Bartie, said.Officials in Houston asked residents to prepare supplies in case they lose power for a few days or need to evacuate homes along the coast. Some in the area are still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey three years ago.Emergencies were declared in Louisiana and Mississippi, and shelters opened with cots set farther apart, among other measures designed to curb coronavirus infections.Laura’s arrival comes just days before the 29 August anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which breached the levees in New Orleans, flattened much of the Mississippi coast and killed as many as 1,800 in 2005. Hurricane Rita then struck south-west Louisiana that 24 September, as a category 3 storm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67df8e8f514f86f8b62987288afacf48fcd9f6d4/0_372_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8e28452d01e52e8d0ce7dc8f886332ee","title":"coronavirus live news gaza in lockdown following first local cases hong kong man re infected","story":"Turkey records highest number of new cases since mid-June India worse than US and Brazil in number of daily new cases European re-infections add to immunity concerns prompted by Hong Kong caseMore US colleges are grappling with high numbers of students testing positive for Covid-19 just days into the start of the new semester, after some universities rolled back their campus reopening plans in recent weeks.The University of Alabama on Monday reported more than 550 people across its campuses had tested positive for Covid-19 since it resumed in-person classes on 19 August. Most of those infected were students, faculty and staff at the university’s main campus in Tuscaloosa.Citing a “dramatic increase” in coronavirus cases on campus, the mayor of Tuscaloosa issued an executive order on Monday ordering bars to shut down for 14 days and placing restrictions on other establishments.“Many students who tested positive for Covid-19 have chosen to go home to isolate,” Kellee Reinhart, the university’s vice chancellor for communications, told Reuters.Reinhart said the school had an “ample amount” of space for Covid-19 positive students to isolate and that it was enhancing testing of various groups.The number of positive cases does not include the 400 students who tested positive upon returning to University of Alabama campuses before classes began last week.Alabama is not alone in scrambling to deal with Covid-19 college outbreaks.The University of Southern California (USC), which resumed education almost entirely online on 17 August, on Monday said that more than 100 students at the University Park Campus in Los Angeles were in a 14-day quarantine after exposure to the virus.Ohio State University, where classes resume on Tuesday, this week issued more than 200 interim suspensions for students following a string of large parties where health and safety rules were largely ignored, according to media reports.Last week, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill cancelled in-class instruction after positive cases of Covid-19 shot up dramatically.A representative of Lebanon’s hospitality sector said that service and tourism businesses would defy a newly reinstated coronavirus lockdown that has compounded the crisis-hit country’s economic woes.“From tomorrow, we will open our doors,” said Tony Ramy, head of the syndicate of owners of restaurants, cafes, nightclubs and pastry shops.“The arbitrary and demagogic decision to close down, whether partially or fully, does not concern us any more,” he said in a televised statement from a Beirut street heavily damaged by the huge 4 August explosion at the capital’s port.An AFP photographer said dozens of people gathered in support of the announcement, some holding signs that read “Tourism is the pulse of Lebanon” and “For us, the state vanished with the blast”.The declaration, made on behalf of a wider tourism body also representing hotels and seaside resorts, came four days after authorities imposed a two-week coronavirus lockdown to stem a string of record-hitting daily infection tolls.Under the latest rules, malls, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, restaurants and coffee shops have been ordered to close.Restaurants, coffee shops and pastry shops can deliver, but only between 6am and 6pm due to an overnight curfew.Ramy blamed the government for the devastating explosion at Beirut’s port and the huge losses it has caused the tourism industry, which he estimated at around $1bn – including $315m for restaurants alone.He called on the sector to engage in “civil disobedience” against the state by severing commercial ties with the government and depriving it of tax money.“We will not pay a single penny until we have a new state,” he said.The interior ministry responded that it would punish those who flouted the lockdown, and urged Lebanese to act in the public interest.“The interior ministry ... warns it will not be lenient in implementing what the laws stipulate for transgressors, from issuing fines to referral to the relevant judicial authority,” caretaker interior minister Mohammed Fahmi said, shortly before the country announced a record 24-hour coronavirus death toll of 12.The Beirut traders’ association this week also said businesses wanted to reopen from Wednesday.Authorities fear Lebanon’s fragile health sector would struggle to cope with a further spike in coronavirus cases, especially after some hospitals near the port were damaged or taken out of commission in the explosion.Translate Bio said that an experimental coronavirus vaccine it developed with French drugmaker Sanofi induced immune response in early-stage non-human primate studies.In a regulatory filing, the company cited Sanofi’s presentation slides showing that the vaccine candidate induced neutralising antibodies and T-cell responses in animal studies.Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I’ll be steering the blog for the next few hours.Feel free to get in touch with any story tips or personal experiences you would like to share.Thank you so much to everybody who kept me company throughout the day by sending in news tips and comments, and to all of you for reading along. That’s it from me, Lucy Campbell, ‘til tomorrow. The French health ministry said it had recorded 3,304 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, well below daily highs seen last week and taking the cumulative total to 248,158.The number of new infections was above the 1,995 reported on Monday – which traditionally shows a dip – but remained well below Sunday’s new post-lockdown record of 4,897 and below the levels above 3,600 reported in the second half of last week.The ministry also said the death toll rose by 16 to 30,544, while the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 fell to a new post-lockdown low of 4,600. The number of people in intensive care rose by 11 to 410 and is now back up to levels last seen at the end of July.Turkey’s coronavirus cases rose to the country’s highest level since mid-June on Tuesday at 1,502, according to data provided by the government, which responded by banning some celebrations in 14 provinces.The health minister, Fahrettin Koca, said on Twitter that 24 more people had died from Covid-19, bringing the toll to 6,163. More than 261,000 people have contracted the disease in Turkey, according to the official tally.New cases were last this high on 15 June when the country logged 1,592 cases, two weeks after it lifted a partial lockdown.Sweden’s public health agency said on Tuesday a faulty test kit had returned some 3,700 false positive results, an error discovered by two laboratories during routine quality controls.The agency said the PCR kits, which test for an ongoing Covid-19 infection, were made in China by the company BGI Genomics and had been distributed worldwide.In Sweden, the kits were used by people conducting at-home tests between March and August, the agency said.Mostly, “people who had mild symptoms or who didn’t feel any symptoms at the time of the test received false positive results”, the agency said in a statement.It added that it would contact those affected this week, as well as adjusting Sweden’s official number of cases.“The faulty test kit has been reported to the Swedish Medical Products Agency. It has been exported by China to many other countries,” the agency said, adding that it has “informed relevant authorities in Europe and the WHO”.Sweden on Tuesday said it had 86,891 confirmed cases of coronavirus and there had been 5,814 deaths.Brazilian senator Flavio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of president Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a statement by Flavio’s spokesman.Flavio has no symptoms of Covid-19 and is at home, it said, adding he has started taking chloroquine and azithromycin as part of a treatment against the virus.President Bolsonaro is a big supporter of chloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, despite the lack of solid evidence it works against the disease.Bolsonaro himself caught the virus earlier, as did his wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, and his youngest son, Jair Renan.Hungary can reopen schools next week for the first time since mid-March based on fresh data on coronavirus infections, state news agency MTI reported on Tuesday, citing the minister of human capacities Miklos Kasler.Kasler said the government had worked out a protocol for schools to follow about social distancing, using sanitisers, and the use of common areas.He did not go into detail and did not say if wearing a mask would be mandatory.The central European country of about 10 million people has reported 5,215 cases of coronavirus and 614 deaths. On Tuesday, 24 new cases were recorded.Hungary will tighten border crossing rules from 1 September to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as the number of new infections is rising in neighbouring countries, prime minister Viktor Orbán said on Friday.“As the school year starts, we will no longer be able to work with the border crossing system that was used during the summer,” Orban said.The government is expected to announce the new rules this week. Nationalist Orban’s government imposed strict lockdown rules in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus, and eased those restrictions only gradually in May. Portugal’s prime minister, Antonio Costa, met a top doctors’ representative on Tuesday to apologise for calling a group of medics sent into a virus-stricken retirement home “cowards”.Costa “clearly communicated the respect and confidence he has” in the profession, said the president of the Order of Physicians, Miguel Guimaraes.Costa himself said he hoped the “misunderstandings” had been cleared up.The row erupted after doctors had to be sent into a retirement home in southern Portugal where 18 had died from the virus and the infected staff were themselves unable to continue caring for the residents.A seven-second video clip shared widely on social networks had shown Costa complaining that “the president of the regional health authority sent the doctors to do their jobs. And these guys, the cowards, didn’t do anything.”The remarks were from an off-the-record conversation following an interview Costa gave to the Expresso weekly.But a statement from the Order of Physicians said that whether on or off the record, the remarks were offensives.Despite a lack of resources, their members had never refused to cooperate in looking after the sick, elderly people, dismissing allegations made by the prime minister, said the order.In the portion of the interview that was published on Saturday, Costa had defended the state against criticism from the Order of Physicians, saying the health authorities had “reacted immediately” to the retirement home crisis.Portugal has recorded 1,805 deaths and 55,912 infections from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, among a population of roughly 10 million people.American Airlines has said it will cut 19,000 US jobs in October as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to weigh on air travel, unless the government extends aid for airline employee payrolls.Airlines received $25bn in US government stimulus funds in March meant to cover payrolls and protect jobs through September. As the money runs out without a travel recovery in sight, airlines and unions have lobbied Washington for a further $25bn, but talks have stalled.Including voluntary exits and leaves, the US carrier’s workforce will shrink to about 100,000 in October from the 140,000 it employed in March.“In short, American’s team will have at least 40,000 fewer people working October 1 than we had when we entered this pandemic,” chief executive Doug Parker and president Robert Isom said in a memo to employees that was reviewed by Reuters.The October job cuts comprise 17,500 furloughs of union workers – including 1,600 pilots and 8,100 flight attendants – and 1,500 management positions.EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has published details of his movements in Ireland as he continues to deny that he broke public health regulations in the country. Hogan said that to “the best of my knowledge and ability I believe that I complied with public health regulations in Ireland during my visit”.He handed in 20 pages of documents to the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, after she requested further details of his trip home to Ireland earlier this month.Hogan stated that he played golf in Adare, County Limerick before returning to Kilkenny on 13 August – a day before his 14-day isolation period was due to end.He however stated that he was tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital on 5 August and claimed that therefore ended the self-restriction period.Discrimination, housing and the impact of Covid-19 are among the top priorities for India’s new National Council for Transgender Persons, two trans members said on Tuesday.India is seen as a global leader for its efforts to improve the lives of an estimated 2 million trans people, who face prejudice in the largely conservative country and survive mostly through begging, performing at weddings or selling sex.“One point that runs as a spinal cord in all of this is stigma and discrimination,” said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, one of India’s highest profile trans leaders and a member of the council, which she described as “historic”.Trans people are often denied access to jobs, education and healthcare – three areas that Tripathi, a founder of the Asia Pacific Transgender Network, highlighted as priorities, along with shelter.The council aims to ensure equality by advising on and monitoring government policies and to “redress the grievances” of trans people, according to a 2019 law to protect trans rights, which provided for its creation.Some hope the council will look at the impact of the new coronavirus on trans people, who have been among those worst hit by India’s months-long lockdown, which halted sex work and weddings and passenger trains – a popular site for begging.“While certain government schemes have helped them, including pension and food ration, others have not reached them,” said Meera Parida, who chairs the All Odisha Third Gender Welfare Trust and a member of the council.India reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day, remaining well ahead of the US and Brazil, a Reuters tally based on official reporting showed.It took India from the end of January, when the country’s first case was reported, until July to reach around 1.6 million cases, a period when the government imposed a strict lockdown.However, infections have rocketed by a further 1.5 million since the start of August, taking the total to around 3.1 million, behind only Brazil and the US.The rate of new cases in India is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry.“If we cross the absolute numbers (in Brazil and the United States), I won’t be surprised, but we also have a larger population,” Giridhar Babu, epidemiologist at the non-profit Public Health Foundation of India, told Reuters.India reported its first Covid-19 fatality in mid-March, with the death toll rising to around 35,700 by the end of July. In August so far, around 22,600 deaths have been recorded. Deaths are considered a lagging indicator, given the two-week incubation period of the disease."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338476.1598358837!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 teachers call for face masks to be worn by children aged over six","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents with face masks enter their classroom at the Petri primary school in Dortmund,  Germany. Face masks are not required in Irish primary schools. Photograph: Ina FassbenderAFPTeachers have called for an urgent review of rules which exempt primary schoolchildren from wearing face masks in light of new international health guidance aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19.The World Health Organisation has issued updated recommendations which say children aged between six and 11 should wear face masks on a “risk-based approach”.The WHO’s says this guidance is subject to a number of factors including the intensity of transmission in an area, the child’s ability to use the mask, access to masks and adequate adult supervision.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said on Tuesday that it has written to Taoiseach Micheál Martin seeking clarity on the public health guidance relating to primary and special schools It has called on the Government to “urgently review” guidelines in relation to children wearing face coverings.“The union was promised in June that this guidance would be ‘updated to reflect the changing situation’ in the context of Covid-19 epidemiology in Ireland, and a review was also promised in light of the experience of other jurisdictions whose schools reopened in May and June,” it said. The INTO said it sought clarity three weeks ago from Minister for Education Norma Foley and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in relation to the wearing of face coverings and the approach to be taken in the event that a pupil or staff member tests positive for Covid-19.Testing access“INTO has reminded An Taoiseach that as 100 children have tested positive in the last fortnight it is vital that priority access to testing and tracing be made available to everyone in the education sector,” it said.The union also restated a call for priority access to testing must to be made available to any asymptomatic teacher who requests it. This would help build confidence in the safety of schools as workplaces and address the reasonable concerns of many of its members, the union said. “Prolonged absences from schools awaiting tests benefit no one,” it said.The INTO also said it was aware of a number of members whose health was at “high risk” and who have multiple underlying conditions. In what the union said was a “ grossly unfair move”, the teachers’ occupational health service, Medmark has advised that members with such conditions should return to school. “INTO is now calling on government to intervene so that these members can appeal their Medmark decisions in a timely manner and have the opinion of their treating doctors fully taken into account rather than the Department simply adopting the view, often delivered remotely and facelessly, of the Department of Education’s health adviser,” it said.“As our members return to the front lines this week, urgent and swift action from government is now required to review existing public health guidance and ensure it remains fit for purpose.” Duty of careThe union added that parents were owed a duty of care by the government. It said the employers should be instructed by the Government to provide flexibility for parents in their workplace, as they may need to take swift action to remove their child from the school or keep their child home where they are exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Ms Foley, meanwhile, has said parents can be assured that schools are taking all necessary precautions to ensure children will return to “safe and welcoming” classrooms.She said enormous work is being undertaken in school communities to provide a safe environment for the return of children to schools.“For parents, I understand that you may feel anxious about your child’s return to school,” she said.“We are living in a new normal. However, we have put in place all the precautions necessary and along with the dedication of the principals and teachers at a local school level, you can be assured that your child will return to a safe and welcoming classroom.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Diesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the centuryOne Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environment"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Staff in Miesian Plaza, which houses the departments of health and children, were told to leave the city centre office building. Gardaí, ambulance and fire brigade units were at the scene after 1pm responding to an emergency call following the discovery of the parcel. A Garda spokeswoman confirmed that a suspicious parcel was discovered and said “no further information is available at this time”. It is understood the suspicious parcel was an envelope containing white powder sent to the department offices in the post. The offices were also evacuated in March of last year when an envelope containing powder was discovered. It was later deemed non-hazardous by Defence Forces technicians.Commenting on the incident at the time Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “I’m not sure what kind of oddballs send suspicious packages in the post but they should be well aware that it is not politicians opening the mail, it’s people doing a normal job, a receptionist or a security guard or clerical officer or someone in the constituency team.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336912.1598194872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how three irish exporters are facing the prospect of a hard brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMartin McVicar, co-founder and CEO CombiLift in the Monaghan factory. ‘We have controls in place.’ Photograph: Philip FitzpatrickExporters are turning their attention to the next looming challenge: the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union’s single market and customs union on January 1st without a trade deal.And while Covid-19 continues to dominate the news and adversely affect business, some companies are optimistic that they are prepared as best they can be for the consequences of a hard Brexit.Silverhill Foods of Emyvale in Co Monaghan has an annual turnover of more than €30 million with 70 per cent of the company’s weekly output of 80,000 ducks exported to 27 countries – 40 per cent of them to Chinese restaurants in the UK. The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionAn elderly shop owner in Bandon, Co Cork, who has experienced his second major flooding incident at his premises in a matter of days, describes himself as a “broken man”.Con Linehan opened his menswear business on South Main Street in the town nearly 30 years ago having worked for many years in Saville’s Menswear in Cork city.He estimates that Storm Ellen and Storm Francis have cost him upwards of €20,000 in damage to his premises and stock in less than a week. Business owners in the town were stripped of flood insurance in 2009. A visibly upset Mr Linehan and his wife Ann find themselves in the position of paying for the damage out of their own pockets. “Today was also shocking. It got all the stock rooms. All the fitting rooms were destroyed. “We are trying very hard to keep this business going. I can’t change location because I own the building. Twice in the one week is unbelievable. We weren’t even able to get the shop right from the last flooding last week. The skirting boards are hanging off the walls. They will have to be replaced. “This worry is always hanging over you all the time and at this hour of my life. Every brown penny I have has gone in to this business.”Mr Linehan said that the flooding is yet another burden in a year which saw them closed for months arising out of the pandemic.Business is slow since they reopened as men are not going to weddings or functions in large numbers. Having been closed for months he still had to fork out for a €1,500 ESB bill and all other utility bills and accountancy fees still have to be paid even though more money is going out than comes in. He has called on the people of Bandon to show solidarity with affected businesses such as his, saying that he is at the end of his tether following years of flooding. Meanwhile, on North Main Street in the town Hungarian-born sisters Kathleen and Andrea Guth were mopping up the floor of their flood-damaged hair and beauty salon that they opened last year. The sisters reopened their salon just last week following the Covid-19 restrictions. Andrea Guth said the business is in a prime location in the town. However, they have had a year from hell, with one setback after another, in their business which they set up after years of grafting in salons. “We had roadworks, the virus and now this. What next? This is our first business. The location is supposed to be very good, but so much has happened. “Kathleen Guth lives over the salon. As the water levels on the street rose she made heroic efforts to bring hairdryers, scissors, and boxes of products to her flat.However, paint they had set aside to revamp the shop was ruined and the sisters fear customers will be turned off the salon because of the smell flooding causes. In Kevin Bowen’s clothing store in the town owner Aoife Bowen said her store incurred minor damage. “Luckily the manager and one of the girls got notification about it at 11.45pm. The drains are the problem back here. “On previous occasions water would have come in front and back but it didn’t come in the front. When it came in it was a case of all hands on deck. A little bit of stock was damaged but it wasn’t as bad as other years.”The store is an institution in the town with Aoife’s father opening the premises 57 years ago. “The worst flood was 2009,” she said. “Five years ago we were flooded twice in three weeks. In 2009 we were closed for five months. I am glad we hadn’t gone ahead with getting the place all painted because we thought flooding was gone with the works on the river. “You kind of think ‘where did all the money with the works go?’ How did they miss this?”Stephanie Butler, who has worked at the shop for 40 years said that the multimillion euro flood works in the town had spared them the worst of previous storms. However, she says that there is “huge disappointment” that there are still flaws in the defences to be sorted out.“It is heartbreaking. There are a couple of homes as well which have been destroyed. I know of a house where the kitchen was ruined overnight because of the flooding.”Cork County Council says the level of rainfall seemed to have overwhelmed the collection network. Fianna Fáil Councillor Gillian Coughlan says that a compensation package needs to be put in place for business and home owners.“There is no insurance. These buildings have been flooded time and time again. These repairs will have to come out of their own pockets. That is unsustainable. Year after year. I am calling on the Taoiseach to provide this emergency assistance package for families and businesses. Because these are family businesses,” he said.Meanwhile, in Bantry in west Cork up to 50 businesses incurred flood damage overnight. The local main drainage scheme was unable to cope with up to 25mm of rain falling in a two hour period.New Street, Main Street and Barrack Street were the worst affected in the flooding. The town’s streets were turned in to rivers. At the Drinagh Co Op hardware store staff worked at a fever pitch to save stock. Michael Coughlan, shop floor manager, says that it was “an unusual night.”“The last time I saw flooding like this in the town was in 1988. I think the main drain in the town got blocked and it wasn’t able to take the force of the water. It actually literally bellowed up the streets as it came down. “We had about four inches of water in the shop. It destroys your trade for the short term. Hopefully we will regain it again. We could do without this on top of Covid. But we have a good strong local community and people try to support each other at times like this.”Terence Gibbs, owner of the Cosy Cabin, in Barrack Street in Bantry said that he was holding his breath waiting to see if the insurance company would pay out after his premises was destroyed overnight.“It is not a cosy cabin now. It is a wet cabin. We had about 17 inches of water. I will be the first person to to welcome in 2021. I don’t want to remember this year. We are open six years and we ‘celebrated’ our anniversary with closed doors in July because of Covid. “I have had TDs in here this morning and I have said ‘where is my golf membership?’ All they are doing is going to golf dinners. Even the captain of the Titanic had the decency to go down with the ship. “There is tens of thousands in damage in this pub and I know the insurance company will do everything they can not to pay. Everything here is made of wood hence ‘Cosy Cabin’, so you can imagine the damage.“I am a father of three kids. I love Ireland but I know I could make a better life for us abroad. I am asking Taoiseach Micheál Martin to help us. Where is he today?”Flooding also occurred at Dunmanway, Rosscarbery, Connonagh, Clonakilty, Drimoleague, Leap, Ballydehob, Passage West and Youghal. Cork County Council Fire Service and Roads crews worked throughout Monday night to clear flood water and assist properties affected.The Council Management Team convened on Tuesday to review the situation and will continue to monitor it. Council response crews and contractors remain as a status yellow wind warning is in place for Cork until 7pm.Wet and winy conditions are expected today as Storm Francis crosses Ireland.Southwest winds veering westerly, reaching mean speeds of 55 to 65kmh, will bring widespread severe gusts of 90 to 110kmh (and possibly higher in exposed areas).Following recent weather events, trees have been weakened and remain susceptible to further damage. Landowners have been asked to examine trees within their property for damage.Dursey Cable Car will remain closed on Tuesday and will return to operation only when wind speeds permit.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337854.1598299110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hogan teeters on edge as clifden golf story dominates brussels bubble","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU trade commissioner Phil Hogan would have a better chance at weathering the scandal were it not for a series of traps he set for himself. Photograph: Emmanuel DunandAFP via Getty ImagesIf Phil Hogan thought he could leave the drama and consternation behind him when he flew out of Dublin Airport on Saturday morning for Brussels, he was wrong.Only one story is dominating in the Brussels bubble, and it’s the fallout from the fateful golf soirée in Clifden. The Hogan affair has topped one of the busiest August periods most can remember in a city that usually shuts down for the month, consuming the day’s news cycle and the European Commission’s press conference.Mr Hogan is one of the highest-profile commissioners, at the helm of the powerful trade portfolio which shapes policy around the world through the force of the European Union’s economic and regulatory might.National political stories do not always break through in Brussels, where they are often drowned out by international priorities and the clamour of the affairs of 27 different member states.But the coronavirus pandemic is not a national story. It’s an issue that the European Commission has been consumed with addressing since February. A top official accused of breaking rules designed to curb the pandemic would have been a major story wherever it broke. The commission itself designed and launched an online service – Reopen EU – to help citizens know and follow local rules wherever they are travelling.Whatever happens next Mr Hogan’s reputation as a canny operator has suffered major damage. Not least because he would have a better chance at weathering this scandal were it not for a series of traps he set for himself.His team initially insisted he had travelled directly from Kilkenny to Galway. It subsequently emerged that he had been in and out of Kildare en route despite local lockdown restrictions, as he was stopped by gardaí there for using his mobile phone while driving.This development made a spoofer of the European Commission press office, which had repeated Hogan’s claim about travelling “directly” to the golf event. And the manner of it – coming to light due to a driving infraction, which he had not disclosed – left a decidedly bad taste in the mouth.The commission’s spokeswoman Dana Spinant took a noticeably cool tone towards Mr Hogan as she revealed that his boss, commission president Ursula von der Leyen, had received an account from him of his movements, but had sought further clarifications.“She’s in the process of gathering facts and this is where we stand,” Ms Spinant said. “It is important of course for the president that rules are respected in respect to coronavirus rules, and quarantine regulations and recommendations in particular.”Commissioners are hard to dislodge. Only one has been sacked in the past: Malta’s John Dalli, due to allegations that the tobacco industry tried to bribe him to change proposed legislation in 2012.There are some who argue that commissioners should be above the fray, as once they are in place they represent the whole citizenry of the bloc, and to give the executive the necessary stability to persevere regardless of whatever intrigue might seize Budapest or Rome.Logistical headacheReplacing commissioners is also a logistical headache. Appointments need to be approved by the European Parliament following hearings. The commission cabinet is a careful balance of geography, gender and political persuasion: a replacement would have to come from the Fine Gael pool to avoid triggering a wider reshuffle.It would be a stretch for Ireland to retain the beefy trade portfolio. Dr von der Leyen might be more likely to move an existing commissioner into it, giving Ireland whatever vacancy emerges.Unfortunately for Mr Hogan all of this has already been thought through, due to a move that is now transpiring to be a serious error.In June he floated himself as a potential candidate to be the next director-general of the World Trade Organisation.The bid fell flat. Allies who had supported him to become trade commissioner were puzzled and alienated, wondering why they had thrown their weight behind him, only for Mr Hogan to eye another prize just six months in.Campaigning would have required him to step back from his job for months at a time when the pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to the global system, a trade war between the United States and China was rumbling on and talks about the future trade relationship with Britain near their denouement.This makes it difficult for him to make what would be his strongest argument now – that he is indispensable – given that he himself was willing to walk off the job.And it seriously ticked off his boss, Dr von der Leyen, who now holds his fate in her hands.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338516.1598369877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phil hogan s timeline of movements around ireland in full","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Hogan: accounts his movements in Ireland after golf dinner controversy. Photograph: Kenzo TribouillardAFP via GettyEU Commissioner Phil Hogan has sent a memorandum to President Ursula von der Leyen about his movements during a recent trip to Ireland following the controversy surrounding his attendance at a golf dinner of more than 80 people amid Covid-19 restrictions last week.Here is the timeline in full that Mr Hogan has given for his Irish trip:July 31st – Mr Hogan says he arrived in Ireland, completed the statutory Passenger Locator Form and travelled to his temporary residence in Co Kildare.August 5th – Mr Hogan says he was admitted to a Dublin hospital for a medical procedure. While in hospital, he tested negative for Covid-19 (he says www.citizensinformation.ie confirms that a negative test result ends the self-restriction period).August 6th – He says he was discharged from hospital and returned briefly to his temporary residence in County Kildare.August 7th – He says he travelled to Kilkenny before the local lockdown rules came into effect at midnight in Co Kildare (and neighbouring counties Laois and Offaly).August 12th – He says he travelled to Dublin from Kilkenny for essential work reasons, which required his attendance at the European Commission office. While in Dublin, he says also had separate meetings with the Tánaiste and with Minister Robert Troy, to brief them on events relating to ongoing negotiations with the US.August 13th – He says he played golf in Adare, Co Limerick and returned to Kilkenny.August 17th – He says he travelled from Co Kilkenny to Co Galway via Co Kildare. He says he stopped briefly in Co Kildare at the property in which he had been staying for the purpose of collecting some personal belongings and essential papers relating to the ongoing negotiations with the USTR, Robert Lighthizer, which continued while he was in Co Galway. This culminated in an agreement on a package of tariff reductions on August 21st.August 18th – He says he played golf in Co Galway, staying in Clifden. (no formal dinner or reception).August 19th – He played golf in Clifden, and subsequently attended a formal dinner for which he has since apologised.August 21st – He says he returned from Galway to his temporary residence in Co Kildare to collect his remaining personal belongings, including his passport, and stayed there overnight to catch an early morning flight to his primary residence in Brussels from the nearby airport.August 22nd – He returned to Brussels.In Hogan’s words: The full report“Set out below are the relevant requirements issued by the Irish Government in relation to Covid-19 and how I adhered to them at all times while in Ireland.“The Irish Government introduced a range of measures to give effect to public health guidance on Covid-19. Most of these measures have been introduced as Statutory Instruments under the Health Act 1947.“There are three key regulations that are relevant to the recent media coverage concerning my stay in Ireland between July 31st, 2020 and August 21st, 2020.”1. Restrictions on events “This is relevant to the event organised by the Oireachtas Golfing Society in Clifden, Co. Galway on August 19th, 2020.“At the outset I fully accept that it is abundantly clear that the event should not have been held and that I should not have attended this dinner. I accept this and have made a full apology to the Irish people for having done so.“From a regulatory perspective Statutory Instrument (SI) 234 of 2020 imposed a restriction on a person organising an event indoors to keep the numbers attending below 50 people. The legal obligations imposed by this Regulation rest with the organisers of the event rather than the attendees.“On August 18th, 2020 the Irish Government announced a tightening of this regulation to restrict events to no more than 15 people, although I understand that the Statutory Instrument giving effect to this change and the relevant official guidance to the hospitality sector were only made available subsequent to the event.“In reality this means that the dinner did not come within the remit of the new rules agreed on August 18th. The event is now the subject of a police inquiry to determine its compliance with Covid-19 rules.“I was an invited guest to the event on August 19th, 2020 and was assured by the organisers and the hotel that it was being held in full compliance with all relevant Covid-19 rules.“I had no reason to question or doubt that assurance, particularly in circumstances where an Irish Government Minister was attending and speaking at the event. Again I now recognise that the event should not have proceeded and I should not have attended.”2. Requirements to complete a locator form “SI 181 of 2020 imposes an obligation on international passengers arriving in Ireland to complete a Passenger Locator Form. The information provided on the form is used to contact arrivals over the next 14 days to determine their location and may be used for contact tracing for confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19. The requirements to provide information apply to international passengers, with some exceptions including persons having diplomatic status.“I went to Dublin on essential official business on August 12th, 2020 to brief the Tánaiste, and the Minister for Trade on EU-US trade talks and to attend an event in the European Commission Office.“As I had submitted my contact details on the Passenger Locator Form I remained fully accessible to the authorities at all times as required by the Regulations, notwithstanding that my negative Covid-19 status had been determined since arrival to the State.”3. Restrictions on movement within specific lockdown areas “On August 7th, 2020, the Irish Government introduced a localised lockdown covering three counties, including Kildare, where I was initially staying before admittance to hospital. This lockdown was enforced by SI 295 of 2020 which specifies movement restrictions within the counties involved. People living within the county are not allowed to leave the county and those living outside the county are not permitted to enter the relevant counties.“There are some exceptions – firstly, a person can drive through the county to get to another county and secondly a person can enter the county if they have ‘a reasonable excuse’ to do so. Examples of a reasonable excuse include for reasons of work, moving residence, etc. The law clarifies that the examples listed are specified ‘without prejudice to what constitutes a reasonable excuse’ for the purposes of the restrictions.“In my case, I was in hospital in the run up to the lockdown being introduced and then travelled back to Kildare before going to recuperate in my home county (Kilkenny), which was not under lockdown. I had left Kildare before the lockdown was introduced at midnight on August 7th. My subsequent trips concerning Kildare were as follows“I subsequently passed through Kildare without stopping en route to Dublin on August 12th where I had separate meetings with An Tánaiste, Mr Varadkar and the Minister of State for Trade, Mr. Robert Troy about ongoing EU-US trade talks. I also had a short meeting at the offices of the European Commission. I returned to Kilkenny that evening, travelling through Kildare en route without stopping.“It was during this journey I was stopped by a member of the Irish police who had seen me holding a phone while I was driving. The policeman cautioned me against holding a phone and there were no charges or further actions under the road traffic legislation. I very much regret having answered the phone while driving.“Late on August 21st, I returned from Galway to my apartment in Kildare to collect my belongings including my passport for the purpose of travelling back to my primary residence in Brussels very early the next morning.“To my best understanding, my justification for entering County Kildare to obtain essential working documents or to get my belongings for the purpose of returning home to Brussels constitutes ‘a reasonable excuse’ under the regulations. At all times during my brief presence in Kildare over the period, I followed public health guidance.“To the best of my knowledge and ability I believe that I complied with public health regulations in Ireland during my visit.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338720.1598377769!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who attended the golf dinner and what has happened to them since","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘You are hounding everybody, so no comment and goodbye,’ said guest Loman Dempsey when contacted. Photograph: iStockMore than 80 guests attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in the Station House Hotel, Clifden, Co Galway, last Wednesday at a time when Government regulations strictly limited indoor gatherings. Here is who was at it:Mr Calleary resigned as minister in the fallout from the event. Mr Hogan is now under intense pressure over his position.Table 2 Former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy had a table as president of the golf society. The Westmeath politician had eight guests at his table, according to the seating plan – understood to be mainly members of his family. Mr Cassidy resigned as vice-president of Fianna Fáil following the controversy.Table 3 The society’s 50th anniversary event paid tribute to the late Mark Killilea, a founding member of the group and former Fianna Fáil MEP. Several members of the Killilea family attended the dinner, and his son, Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, gave a speech. Former Fianna Fáil minister and property developer Frank Fahey was also at this table.The table included Senator Paddy Burke and councillor Enda McGloin, who both lost the Fine Gael whip as a result of their attendance. Dr Michael Harty, former TD and chair of the Oireachtas health committee, was also at the table.Others included former Fine Gael senator Paul Coghlan, and John Flaherty, captain of the guard at Leinster House, who is responsible for health and safety in the Houses of the Oireachtas.Table 5 Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe and Fianna Fáil Senator Paul Daly have both apologised for their attendance at the event.Mr Justice Woulfe, who is a former attorney general, is now facing a Supreme Court-ordered review by former chief justice Susan Denham into whether he should have attended the event.Daly, who attended the event with his partner, Bernie, was stripped of the party whip last week by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.Galway businessman and owner of the Station House Hotel John Sweeney and his wife, Treena, were listed as guests at the table, as was the ambassador of Morocco.Table 6 Chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland Brian Hayes was seated here, alongside former Fine Gael senator Imelda Henry.Hayes, who is a former Fine Gael junior minister and MEP, apologised for attending the event, but said it did not affect his ability to fulfil his role as head of the BPFI. According to the seating plan, he also had three unnamed guests at the table.Henry, who is no longer in politics and owns a consulting firm, apologised “unreservedly” for attending the event, adding that she attended in a personal capacity.Table 7 Two Fianna Fáil Senators, Aidan Davitt and Niall Blaney, were among those seated at this table. Both have apologised for attending.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has removed the party whip from both Senators. Mr Davitt has served as a Senator since 2016, while Mr Blaney was elected to the Seanad in 2020.Table 8 Guests at this table included Fine Gael Senator Jerry Buttimer, who resigned as Leas Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, over the affair. His husband, Conchobar Ó Laoghaire, was also listed as a guest. Buttimer has said it was an “unintended but serious lapse of judgment in attending the event”.Other guests were Senator John Cummins, twice mayor of Waterford and one of three Fine Gael Senators who had the party whip removed from them over the scandal.Also at the table was former Independent TD Paudge Connolly, now a Monaghan County Councillor. The  revealed he was playing golf in Spain nine days previous to the dinner. Spain is not on the Government’s green list of countries, meaning people arriving back from there must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Connolly has yet to respond to a request for comment.Table 9 Fianna Fáil Minister of State with responsibility for older people Áine Brady and her husband, Gerry, also a former Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare and a local auctioneer, headed up this table. Neither have responded to phone calls.Kildare was under tightened lockdown restrictions at the time of the golf dinner, which meant residents were restricted to travel within the county, except for work, vital family or medical reasons. Brady is chief executive of Third Age, an organisation that supports older people in Ireland.In a statement reported by the Leinster Leader, she said she was “disappointed that my actions may have distracted from the tremendous work that the organisation does, and I will redouble my efforts to ensure that these programmes will continue to deliver positive outcomes for older people and communities in Ireland.” She added: “I unreservedly apologise and deeply regret my attendance at last week’s event.”There were eight other, as yet unidentified, guests at the Brady table, according to the table plans.Table 10 Among the guests listed was Loman Dempsey, a property consultant and brother of former Fianna Fáil government minister Noel Dempsey.“I have no comment to make about that. You are hounding everybody, so no comment and goodbye,” he said when asked about his attendance.Sean Dempsey, a former school principal who regularly canvassed for his brother Noel, was also listed as a guest.Martin Brett, deputy chairman of Kilkenny County Council, was also at this table, along with a friend, Gerry Crowley. Mr Brett has said attendees were being wrongly “pilloried” and anyone who resigned over the scandal should be reinstated.“There has been a serious level of witch hunt against everybody that was at the dinner … We didn’t breach any guidelines,” he said. Others listed at the table included Anne and Ciaran Dooley, who Mr Brett said, “worked in Brussels at one stage”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Researchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Kirill KudryavtsevAFP via Getty ImagesAs Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent dissident, fought for his life in a Siberian hospital after apparently being poisoned last week, three masked men occupied the chief doctor’s office.Idling under a portrait of President Vladimir Putin pensively strolling through a field of wheat, the men made small talk but refused to say who they were.Their awkward dress and shifty demeanour were all too familiar to Navalny’s family and aides, who quickly recognised them as members of the Russian security services.“It looks really funny – you can tell because they’re these tough-looking, well-built men, and they usually have these manbags,” said Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.The pervasive surveillance against Navalny, who was in Siberia making one of his YouTube corruption investigations, indicates how he remains a thorn in the Kremlin’s side after a decade of activism.Navalny, who has been jailed 13 times for organising protests against Putin, complained to the Financial Times in an interview last year that he and his family were followed around the clock by men he claimed were from Russia’s security services.“It’s been going on for quite some time, but I’d be lying if I told you it was routine and we don’t pay attention to it. Some assholes are sitting next to you all the time. But you don’t stop living your life,” he said. “Lots of people’s reaction to that would be to shut down and hide ... We enjoy our lives as we can.”Aides who accompanied Navalny on the Siberia trip and kept watch at the hospital in Omsk said they had long grown used to being followed by unmarked cars and spotting men trying to hide video cameras.“We know they constantly listen to our phone conversations, we know they put up hidden cameras, we know they take the footage from security cameras everywhere we go,” Zhdanov said. “They interrogated my relatives, everyone I had meetings with – it’s more or less total control.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that surveillance operations were “the prerogative of the secret services” and “cannot and should not be approved” by Putin’s administration.KompromatThe surveillance appears to date at least as far back as 2017, when Navalny began travelling across Russia in an attempt to challenge Putin for president.That year, Ren-TV, a channel whose parent company is reportedly co-owned by close Putin confidant Yuri Kovalchuk, aired a documentary accusing Navalny of receiving secret cash payments from “fugitive oligarchs”. The film used surveillance videos of Navalny on vacation with his family, intercepted phone calls, text messages, and emails, and trailed his employees in cafés.Dmitry Belousov, a former Ren-TV scriptwriter now seeking asylum in the Netherlands, told the FT he believed the secret services had passed on the footage – known in industry jargon as kompromat, for “compromising materials” – to discredit Navalny and other activists.Belousov said that Alexei Malkov, Ren-TV’s chief political producer, had previously bragged to him that a “handler” from the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB, supplied him with surveillance materials for Kremlin-commissioned state TV documentaries.Malkov uploaded the footage to Ren-TV’s servers himself, leaving Belousov to fill in the blanks in the script while reporters chased Navalny’s team on the street for comments.“He met someone, brought the material, and they were basically the ones making the film,” Belousov said. “Nobody makes those films on their own initiative. Everything is done to order for approval. The Kremlin has a story to tell and the FSB and presidential administration put the show together.”Malkov ultimately quit the channel in disgust after making the next film in the cycle, which included surveillance of several teenage opposition candidates for city councils in provincial Russia. “The FSB is the political police, it’s conducting political surveillance in Russia,” he said. “They find any kompromat, publish it on TV, and then the police start charging these activists with crimes based on nothing.”The Kremlin and the FSB did not respond to a request for comment. Ren-TV told independent investigative site Proekt, which first published Belousov’s story, that Malkov did not take instructions from the Kremlin and said its sources “could be all kinds of structures”.SurveillanceReports in the Russian press indicated the Kremlin was keeping Navalny’s seemingly routine trip to the cities of Novosibirsk and Tomsk on a very tight leash.An article in the pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets on Saturday cited “sources in the security structures” who said they had followed Navalny throughout the trip as he took selfies with followers in the town centre, rented what they termed a “conspiratorial apartment” and took a dip in the Tom river.The leak was apparently intended to show that agents could not have poisoned Navalny, claiming they had failed to detect “any superfluous or suspicious contacts”. But the article nevertheless revealed the apparent scale of the surveillance, as officers cross-checked his followers’ credit cards, a sushi delivery order, hotel bookings and followed him in unmarked cars.Proekt said a senior Kremlin official had shown its reporter Navalny’s test results before they were made public and said they showed he was “definitely not poisoned”.“The amount of resources they spend on it is remarkable,” Zhdanov said. He said that on one occasion he and Navalny met a fellow activist in a Moscow café and realised that “each of us had our own surveillance team”.“It was hilarious because there was an enormous number of people around, it was completely blatant. Seven people were within touching distance and more were sitting outside.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338524.1598365249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teenagers unearth 1 100 year old gold coins in israel","story":"The Israel Antiquities Authority has announced a find of rare gold coins in Yavneh, south of Tel Aviv, during an archaeological excavation.

Photograph: Heidi LevineAFP via Getty ImagesThe treasure needed to be secured. So the hoard of 425 gold coins was stowed in a clay jar, its lid secured with a nail, and stashed in the sands of what is now central Israel. It then sat undisturbed for more than 1,100 years, until last week, when two 18-year-olds taking part in an archaeological excavation by a hillside in Yavneh noticed something unusual. “I dug in the ground and, when I excavated the soil, saw what looked like very thin leaves,” said Oz Cohen, one of the teenagers. “When I looked again, I saw these were gold coins. It was really exciting to find such a special and ancient treasure.”The teenagers were volunteers in a vast project linked to the construction of a community in Yavneh, south of Tel Aviv. The programme offers the promise of connecting young people with history, and, while it is meant to be culturally rewarding, it is not often that someone strikes gold – literally.In fact, Robert Kool, a coin expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said the find was a “rare treasure” that could help archaeologists gain a deeper understanding of what was happening in the region at the time. The coins, which weigh less than a kilo and are made of pure gold, date to the ninth century, when the Abbasid Caliphate ruled a vast empire stretching from Persia in the east to North Africa in the west. “The hoard consists of full gold dinars, but also – what is unusual – contains about 270 small gold cuttings, pieces of gold dinars cut to serve as small change,” Mr Kool said in a statement. The cutting of gold and silver coins was a regular feature of the monetary system in Islamic countries after the 850s with the sudden disappearance of bronze and copper coins, he said. One of the cuttings unearthed last week, which Mr Kool said had never before been found in excavations in Israel, included a fragment of a gold solidus coin of the Byzantine emperor Theophilos, who ruled from 829 to 842. Its appearance in an Islamic coin hoard offers proof of the continuous connections between the two rival empires during this period, scholars say. Whether it was through war or trade, money kept flowing. Mr Kool said the era was one of the least understood in Israel and that any clue was useful. But coins are especially telling. “You can read the name of the caliph in Baghdad, ” he said about coins from the time. “The name of the governor who rules in his name in Egypt is often included.” There may also be names of other sub-rulers, the mint where the coin was produced and, most important, the date of production. Liat Nadav-Ziv and Elie Haddad, archaeologists at the Israel Antiquities Authority, which is in charge of the sprawling excavation site, said in a statement that the finding might “indicate that international trade took place between the area’s residents and remote areas”.They also said it was clear that the money had been hidden on purpose. “The person who buried this treasure 1,100 years ago must have expected to retrieve it, and even secured the vessel with a nail so that it would not move,” the statement added. “We can only guess what prevented him from returning to collect this treasure.”It would have been worth a small fortune at the time, Mr Kool said. “For instance,” he said, “a person could buy a luxurious house in one of the best neighborhoods in Fustat, the enormous wealthy capital of Egypt in those days.” – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The Briefing, The \u0026#39s two-minute audio updatesNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

The concert is taking place without a live audience and with fewer musicians because of coronavirus.The decision to buck tradition and reinvent the finale of the Proms season began when Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who is conducting the Last Night, and David Pickard, the BBC Proms director, discussed changing the repertoire to reflect the international debates about racism. But the attempt to placate both camps by choosing arrangements that would not require a soloist prompted accusations that it had “scored an own goal.”Mr Fox called on his supporters to retaliate by buying Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land of Hope and Glory in a bid to get it to the top of the UK charts.\u0027Would the BBC then have to play it? What a beautiful day that would be,” he wrote on Twitter.Within a few hours, the 1994 remastered track had reached No.1 in the UK iTunes chart.Meanwhile, a petition calling for traditional versions of Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory to be included in the programme attracted more than 20,000 signatures.It accuses the BBC of the “worst kind of tokenism” and insists that the songs are a “vital element of our heritage” that “sustained us in moments of national peril.”  It describes the Last Night as a “much-cherished ritual,” arguing that the songs are sung with pride “but also with a degree of joshing humour and wry self-mockery that is characteristically British.”Mr Sharma said the BBC should ensure that viewers who do not find the words offensive are able to join in from their living rooms.“Personally I would like to see the lyrics sung and of course it is always possible to put lyrics up as subtitles on the screen so if people want to they can join in at home,” he told Times Radio.Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said the BBC always panicked about race as there was no ethnic ersity at the top.“What you have is rooms full of white men panicking that someone is going to think they are racist,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"picture special farewell boeing 747","story":"The 747 was imagined in the 1960s to meet a growing demand for air travel, with Pan Am asking Boeing to design a plane twice the size of the 707, the first jetliner.It was the first twin aisle airliner and able to sit up to 10 across in economy class.

Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Through the 1980s, Boeing was taking scores of orders for the aircraft every year, and delivering as many as 70 to its customers.The 747 brought air travel to the masses but it also ushered in a new Golden Age of Flying, with additional space allowing for unprecedented comfort and luxury.Though more and more people were able to fly, it was still considered a special occasion, prompting travellers and families to dress up for flights. Aircraft serving the holiday markets of the Caribbean were said to have carnival atmospheres on board.As planned by Boeing, the 747 was long popular with cargo operators thanks to its unobstructed fuselage and vast capacity. It could take off with a payload of up to 970,000lbs.Boeing continued to update the aircraft, stretching and modernising it to make it more fuel efficient. There are five main variants, with different models within each category, including the latest, the 747-8. Nasa still has a 747 in service it used to transport spacecraft, while Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic does the same, launching its aircraft at altitude. The evolution of smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft that are easier to fill, such as Boeing’s own 787 Dreamliner, makes the 747 less attractive to airlines. Today, more cargo operators than passenger airlines fly the aircraft, while orders have all but dried up. "},{"url":null,"title":"putin has no good options belarus","story":"In the six years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commentators have speculated about what might lead the Kremlin into another military intervention in the eastern part of Europe. What is currently happening in Belarus – large-scale protests against Alexander Lukashenko following rigged presidential elections – has been the most popular bet.Yet, Vladimir Putin – in spite of his well-publicised dislike of public protests – has been hesitant to intervene militarily in the post-Soviet space in response to crises that result from rigged elections and result in large-scale protests. For every Ukraine in 2014, there is Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, Kyrgyzstan in 2005 and 2010, and Armenia in 2018.True, the international order – and Russia’s place (and, perhaps more importantly, its perceived place) within it – has changed significantly since the so-called colour revolutions of 2003-2005, but there are still lessons to be learnt from Russia’s behaviour over the past decade.The situation in Belarus currently resembles that in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia more than it does that in Ukraine. In Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, popular protests emerged in response to rigged parliamentary elections, with the countries’ kleptocractic leaders ousted by movements promising to crack down on corruption. In much the same way, the protests in Belarus appear to be motivated primarily by domestic issues – the rigged presidential election on August 9, as well as widespread discontent with authoritarian leadership.The protests in Ukraine were motivated by domestic issues, including widespread corruption, as well. But they were also motivated by international issues, most obviously former president Viktor Yanukovych’s last-minute decision to back away from signing an Associate Agreement with the European Union in favour of aligning his country more closely with Russia. As a result, the protests in Kyiv – unlike those in Bishkek or Yerevan – were marked by overt pro-Western, pro-European Union, and anti-Russian messages.Such messages are not visible in Minsk, but this has not stopped Lukashenko from playing on Putin’s fears of a colour revolution in Russia. “Defending Belarus today is nothing less than defending all of our space,” Lukashenko said to Putin, according to state news agency Belta. “If Belarusians don’t hold out, this wave will roll over there.” Lukashenko has also invented military threats facing Belarus from NATO, portraying himself as a last bastion for Russia against an increasingly hostile West.For all of this, however, the Kremlin values Belarus more than it does its leader. Russia tried to remove Lukashenko in 2010, and Lukashenko has rarely been a reliable partner for the Kremlin’s geopolitical games. He refused to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, following Russia’s war with Georgia, and has flip-flopped on Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, maintaining strategic ambiguity ever since.On August 16, when Russia cited the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a military bloc of six former Soviet states who have pledged to defend each other in case of attack, it promised only a “readiness to render the necessary assistance to resolve the challenges facing Belarus” and did not mention Lukashenko by name.Does this mean that Russia will not intervene militarily in Belarus? No. But the Kremlin is unlikely to intervene militarily to keep Lukashenko in power, at least in the long term. Instead, Moscow – amid continuing large-scale protests and a steady trickle of defections from Lukashenko’s government – may be willing to contemplate other options, including a power transition. This would become more likely if the Kremlin sees a figure in the disparate Belarus opposition movement with whom it could work.In fact, it would be surprising if the Kremlin were not already testing the water. It did this in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, cultivating links between the governing United Russia party and the head of Kyrgyzstan’s interim government Roza Otunbayeva, and in Armenia in 2018, establishing contact with opposition figures and settling on Nikol Pashinyan while Serzh Sargsyan was still in office. In doing so, both Otunbayeva and Pashinyan made a point of committing to maintain the geopolitical status quo.In Belarus, this option would likely involve the Kremlin having to convince Lukashenko that retirement in exile is the least bad option for him. It would also likely involve having to share a mediation role with EU member states in any political transition process. But the Kremlin may ultimately deem it worthwhile in order to ensure that its core interests are protected.Dr Andrew Foxall is Director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, the London-based international affairs think tankMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ronaldinho released spending five months detention forged passport","story":"Former Brazil football star Ronaldinho was released on Monday by a Paraguayan judge after spending five months in detention over a forged passport.Judge Gustavo Amarilla also released Ronaldinho\u0027s brother Roberto de Assis Moreira, who likewise had been held for a month in jail and another four months under house arrest in a hotel in Paraguay\u0027s capital, Asuncion, for the same charge.The 40-year-old former World Cup winner is free to travel to whatever country in the world he wants but he must inform us if he changes his permanent residence for a period of one year, the judge said.He has no restrictions except for the fulfilment of reparations for damage to society.Dressed in jeans, a black beret and black shirt, Ronaldinho accepted the terms of his release, which include payment of $90,000 in damages. His brother, who is also Ronaldinho\u0027s business manager, must pay $110,000.The judge stressed that he was not issuing a definitive dismissal of the case but rather that Ronaldinho was benefitting from a conditional suspension of the procedure.His brother, on the other hand, was given a two-year suspended sentence.Prosecutors said they did not believe Ronaldinho took part in the plan to manufacture the fake Paraguayan passports but believed de Assis Moreira was aware that the passports were false.They flagrantly used a public document containing false content, said Marcelo Pecci, one of the public prosecutors, who said it was a very serious offense.De Assis Moreira must appear before a judge in Brazil every four months for two years and will have a criminal record.Ronaldinho\u0027s situation is not the same as Roberto\u0027s. He has no obligation to appear before any Brazilian judicial authority. He must only report a change of address, said Amarilla, who accepted a recommendation by four prosecutors to avoid the need for an oral trial.Before Monday\u0027s trial the public prosecutor said that Ronaldinho displayed no personal characteristics or criminal behavior that ... would put society at risk.The brothers arrived in Paraguay on March 4 with Ronaldinho, the 2005 Ballon d\u0027Or winner, due to take part in an event in support of disadvantaged children.However, two days later, the pair were taken into police custody when investigators raided their hotel following the discovery they had fake documents.Before the judge announced his decision, the defense issued a statement insisting on the innocence of both brothers.They presented Paraguayan documents to migration authorities believing they were authentic, said the statement. The people they trusted deceived them vilely.After being held in a police station in Asuncion, where Ronaldinho celebrated his 40th birthday on March 21, the two men had been under house arrest for more than four months in a luxury hotel in the capital, on bail of $1.6 million.The investigation has since expanded into a case of possible money laundering and criminal association.Some 18 people have already been arrested in connection with the case, most of them immigration officials or police officers.The investigation found no indication that either participated in money laundering or criminal association, said the defense statement.Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was crucial in Brazil\u0027s 2002 World Cup win.He played for European giants such as Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain during a hugely successful 10-year stint in Europe.He won the Champions League and two La Liga titles with Barcelona and Serie A with Milan.After returning home to Brazil he won the Copa Libertadores - South America\u0027s equivalent of the Champions League - with Atletico Mineiro.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rule britannia freedom not slavery","story":"The BBC is in charge of the Proms, and is proud of their wide appeal. It says on its own website: “Last Night of the Proms is one of the most popular nights for the whole of the BBC Proms.” Does it ask itself why? It may have something to do with the fact that Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are always sung that evening, with the audience enthusiastically joining in.For years now, pressure groups have complained about these songs. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, protests have grown louder. This year’s all-encompassing excuse of Covid-19 is also being deployed. Allegedly, the large quantity of players required to make the right noise might send the virus flying round the Albert Hall.Critics of Rule, Britannia fasten on a few words. One verse rejects “haughty tyrants”. According to Chi-Chi Nwanoku, a principal double bass player, this is dreadful because the British are so describing those whose land they invade. In fact, the meaning is the exact opposite: it warns against haughty tyrants – unparliamentary European powers of the mid-18th century, such as France and Spain – who might wish to invade us.As for the famous line, “Britons never will be slaves”, this is taken by Wasfi Kani, of Grange Park Opera, to suggest that “someone else can be slaves.The words contain no evidence for that interpretation. They first appeared in Thomas Arne’s 1740 masque, Alfred, about the English King (of burnt cakes legend) who defeated the invading Vikings, thus helping forge the nation. The beings in Rule, Britannia who sing about Britons never being slaves are the “ angels” who oversaw the birth of Britain “from out the azure main”. Their message is that we are born free. So last night the BBC announced that the music stays but the wicked words will go. British people value their freedom. A good many of them like celebrating it with the traditional songs of liberty. If the BBC has difficulty with that, what does it understand about the people from whom it collects the licence fee?The BBC is, however, devoting a radio programme tonight to “code-switching”. The term comes from linguistics. It means the way in which people can move between types of language or different languages in the course of the same conversation. “Franglais” would be a jokey example.Now, however, in our hypersensitive world, it has become another thing we must blame on white supremacy. It is said that black people who work with white people must code-switch to survive. They have to adopt “white” locutions and suppress their accustomed ways of talking.There can be no doubt that such code-switching takes place. But what else would one expect? It applies to any work environment in which people come from different backgrounds. In order to understand one another clearly in the workplace, a particular way of speech will tend to prevail.Thus, until about 40 years ago, the BBC always favoured the “public-school” accent among its presenters. People with regional or working-class accents had to code-switch in order to read the news. Nowadays, it is the other way round. People with public-school backgrounds have to code-switch to “mockney” in order to get on in the BBC.When I was a boy, I attended the village school, but was brought up at home with “received pronunciation”. One day, when schoolfriends came home to tea, my parents taped our conversation. The recording showed me unconsciously code-switching between fellow-pupils and my parents.Surely such adjustments are amusing, and sometimes necessary, rather than yet another thing to get furious about.I am so old that I can remember when Joe Biden first tried to become president of the United States. In the autumn of 1987, Mr Biden got into trouble for pinching speech phrases from Neil Kinnock, then the British Labour leader. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” Mr Kinnock had asked in Wales, in May.In Iowa, in August 1987, Mr Biden said, “I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?” He was “the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree”. Both men argued that their forebears had suffered not from stupidity, but lack of opportunity. Mr Biden did not acknowledge the phrase as Mr Kinnock’s. He did not get the nomination.Part of the comedy was the idea of a thousand generations of Kinnocks, or Bidens. For that, one would have to go back to before the invention of the wheel. It is only about 20 generations to the invention of the university.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kimberly guilfoyle speech rnc watch stephen colbert late show","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Guilfoyle described herself as a ‘first-generation American’, citing her roots in Puerto Rico – a US territoryThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said Mr Williamson is simply not the person to deliver a safe return to schools and must resign”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSchool leaders\u0027 union ASCL wrote to the education secretary calling on him to commission an immediate independent inquiry into what went wrong.The Ofqual chief regulator had been due to face a grilling from MPs on the House of Commons Education Committee next Wednesday over the chaos surrounding exam results, which initially saw an algorithm downgrade nearly 40 per cent of A-level pupils\u0027 predicted grades. Amid fury among parents and pupils, Mr Williamson was forced into a U-turn which resulted in a massive increase in passes and inflated results compared to previous years.In a statement, Ofqual said that Ms Collier had decided that the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership and was stepping down after four years in post.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sally Jeffrey visitor attraction assistant at the Wallace Monument cleans the case which houses William Wallace sword in the Hall of Arms room at the monument near Stirling as they prepare to re-open as Scotland continues with the gradual lifting of restrictions.Restored World War Two landing craft LCT 7074 is transported from from the Naval Base in Portsmouth to its final resting place at the D-Day Story at SouthseaJenny Nguyen and Tony Cao, from Vietnam, pose for wedding photos on Tower Bridge in London, as it remains closed to vehicles after it was stuck open on Saturday due to a mechanical fault.

Dame Glenys will be supported by a new committee of the Ofqual board, chaired by Ofsted chief executive Amanda Spielman.A Downing Street spokesman yesterday said that Mr Johnson was “sorry” for the distress felt by students who were initially given grades below the requirements for their chosen university courses, in many cases because Ofqual’s computers adjusted results in line with their schools’ performance in previous years in a way which favoured private schools.PM ‘sorry for distress’ caused by exam result fiascoOfqual threatened with legal action over exams contract I resigned as education secretary over marking it’s about credibilitySpeaking during a visit to Devon today, the prime minister said: “I mean you think about the people that have done their A-levels, their GCSEs this year, they’ve been in many ways a remarkable generation.“They’ve had to stay at home, which has been difficult, it has posed risks, as I say, to their health, to their mental health, they’ve done a fantastic job, they’ve protected the NHS, they’ve helped to save lives, to get us through this pandemic and I’m just pleased that they now do have results that they can work with.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Williamson will also be held to account for his part in the affair when he gives evidence to the committee on 16 September.The education secretary was facing growing calls to step down. He has so far dodged questions over whether he offered Mr Johnson his resignation.Ms Moran said: It is incredibly disappointing that Gavin Williamson has refused to take responsibility for the combination of initial school return failure and the more recent exam fiasco and has instead allowed to let someone else take the blame.“He has lost the trust of students, parents and teachers who he failed to consult, leaving universities and colleges in chaos.“Meanwhile the prime minister is still yet to apologise for the stress and harm his government caused to students, parents and teachers.Gavin Williamson is simply not the person the deliver a safe return to schools and must resign.”And Labour frontbencher Bill Esterson said: Sally Collier, head of Ofqual, has done the decent thing, accepted responsibility for the exam fiasco and resigned. How can it be right that Collier has resigned but education secretary, Gavin Williamson hasn\u0027t?Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “This move follows the failure of the statistical model that led to this year’s grading fiasco, but the fault is not hers alone.“Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right.“Schools and colleges put their trust in the government over this matter, dutifully followed the processes advised by Ofqual, and now feel badly let down by the ensuing debacle. They deserve some answers and so do their students.Bill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said it was not altogether surprising that Ms Collier had quit, but said responsibility was shared with government.He told the BBC: This was all about protecting the system against grade inflation - too many high grades, which would seem to devalue the achievements of young people. But I have to say young people have had such a hard time of it in the last few months, I don\u0027t think grade inflation was something that we needed to worry about quite as much as we did.Education committee chair Robert Halfon said he was surprised Ms Collier had quit just days after agreeing to appear before his cross-party inquiry, and said he hoped she would still attend to answer questions on Wednesday.I\u0027ve tried to stay away from finger-wagging, because my policy is to find out what\u0027s gone wrong and who was responsible for it, and why this sort of mega-mess was allowed to happen in the first place, Mr Halfon told Times Radio. I\u0027m not going to comment on iniduals, but clearly she felt Ofqual had failed the parents, pupils and schools, and that\u0027s why she went.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Labour is calling on the government to urgently scrap its cap on benefits in order to avoid a wave of evictions for rent arrears.In a letter to employment minister Mims Davies, Labour frontbencher Seema Malhotra warned that the month-long extension of the moratorium on evictions announced on Friday would only delay the inevitable for thousands of families unless the cap was also lifted.Official figures released earlier this month showed a “shocking” 93 per cent rise in the number of families hit by the cap during the coronavirus pandemic, with households losing an average £248 a month, she said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe cap - which limits a household\u0027s total annual benefits to £20,000 a year or £23,000 in London - meant that many of these families were missing out on the temporary uplift of universal credit and local housing allowance introduced by ministers to help disadvantaged households cope with the impact of Covid-19, said the shadow employment minister.Unless it is scrapped, she warned that tenants will receive only brief and temporary relief from last week\u0027s announcement of an extension to 20 September of the ban on evictions and a new requirement for landlords to give tenants six months’ notice.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sally Jeffrey visitor attraction assistant at the Wallace Monument cleans the case which houses William Wallace sword in the Hall of Arms room at the monument near Stirling as they prepare to re-open as Scotland continues with the gradual lifting of restrictions.Restored World War Two landing craft LCT 7074 is transported from from the Naval Base in Portsmouth to its final resting place at the D-Day Story at SouthseaJenny Nguyen and Tony Cao, from Vietnam, pose for wedding photos on Tower Bridge in London, as it remains closed to vehicles after it was stuck open on Saturday due to a mechanical fault.

Rent arrears will grow further unless the extension is used effectively to scrap the benefit cap.”Johnson needs to find a long-term solution to the evictions issueStarmer accuses PM of ignoring \u0027looming crisis\u0027 for rentersThe renters facing homelessness within days as evictions set to resumeShe cited a report last year by the cross-party House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee, which found that many of those affected by the cap faced an “intolerable” financial position, with evidence from one housing association that 55 per cent of those affected fell into rent arrears.And she said that the overwhelming majority - 86 per cent - of households subject to the cap include children, with two-thirds of them being single parent families. The shadow employment minister asked Ms Davies to provide an assessment of the numbers of households at risk of eviction and details of steps being taken by the Department for Work and Pensions to allow them to stay in their homes.“Labour has repeatedly called on the government to scrap the benefit cap and extend the ban on evictions to avoid a wave of homelessness,” said Ms Malhotra. “This  policy pushes families and children into poverty.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way. And Jeff Goldblum knows, he used to do a bit of stand-up.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica.

Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But former Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned it is a critical endgame and the UK will soon have to be preparing for talks to collapse.He said Brussels will try to take things to the wire, adding: “The last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.” One Eurocrat admitted “outsiders don’t realise how pessimistic we’ve become” about getting a trade deal.The UK is holding firm on a refusal to accept EU red tape or cave in on fishing rights. Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.He believes Downing Street is laying the ground for a vicious “blame game” over who is responsible for the stalemate.In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week’s tetchy round of talks have made things worse.The UK’s negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But Mr Barnier dismissed it as “unrealistic” and urged EU states to stay “cold blooded”.He insisted that the UK’s “clear strategy” will be to “trade off” fishing access for freedom from EU rules at the last minute.An EU source said: “We expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.”A British official hit back, saying: “The UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.“If the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.”Well now Ive seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling usthat the Brexit negotiations are “running out of time.” This of course is the man who squandered a year on the minutiae of the Withdrawal Agreement whilst refusing to discuss the hugely important future trade arrangement, all the while claiming that we were “running out of time.” Rather shamefully the British government put up with this nonsense, which led in turn to my resignation – but that is a story for another day.Now Barnier is desperate to resolve his so-called redline issues before we get to the critical endgame.I have always said that the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years. But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to sht the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal.The reason for this is that the European Union always runs out the clock. When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of Europe will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.If we end up with a no deal scenario – and it is possible – the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the United Kingdom. They stand to lose access to the most efficient financial market in the world, the City, which provides brilliantly low cost and low risk finance to all of their industries. They think that is punishing us, but they will really punish themselveswe are smart about it. They stand to lose any access to British fisheries, rather than the sensible and civilised arrangements that would apply once they accept agreed British control of our waters.They stand to lose the funding that was agreed under the Withdrawal Agreement, which was agreed on the presumption that we would get a trade deal, a political promise that the EU is failing to keep.Without a reasonable trade deal there is nothing to stop the United Kingdom repudiating the whole agreement, and simply maintaining the parts that we as a civilised nation would of course apply – including for example the protection of the rights of European Citizens.But pay money  Why  Recognise European product classications in the UK, the so-called Geographical Indications, that protect inidual European products like ham,or cheese, orbeer or wine  Why should we not allow cheaper and better products from the rest of the world to use the names in our Supermarkets This would not be the best outcome, but we would manage perfectly well.If the EU put tarfs on our goods, we willthe favour, and make money on it. Our currency would no doubt adjust to keep us competitive.And without the limitations of EU law, we could support the industries that the EU is trying to punish.Which of course is one of the reasons that the EU is trying to tie our hands on state subsidies to industry. Britain has always been much less likely to use these than European nations, but the Europeans know that they are a potential defensive weaponthey try to punish our industries.David Frost, our Brexit negotiator, is doing a good job. He has been clear on our “red lines”. Unlike the EU “red lines”, these are not just ideas made up by the Government, they are the direct outcome of the referendum. As such they represent the peoples decision, and are not subject to concession.We are not going to allow Brussels to decide our laws – which is what Barnier means by a level playing field. So it is time that the Europeans woke up to the realities.It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tarf deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both. Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty and the delay on March th last year was the only time when the economy was rattled – businesses will be ready for Brexit come what may when the transition period finishes at the end of the year.Certainty is what both business and the country as a whole require, not just to get Brexit done but also to help ensure that the economy bounces back from the negative economic effects of the lockdown.We already know that there has been no “Great British Exodus” nor immediate recession despite what certain pundits and commentators predicted.As long as we leave on time and do not drag this out any further, there is no reason why this should change. Indeed,we deliver the certainty of the end of the transition period, there is every reason that business and the economy will bounce back.It is incredible after all this time to see Brussels still bent on ensuring that Britain somehow loses out, so fixated are they on deterring others from ­abandoning their club.They are still making patently unreasonable power grabs even their europhile fans struggle to defend. They still want newly-independent Britain to surrender full control of our fishing waters. To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.They simply must change the recordthey’re genuinely worried about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms — and them copping the blame. No objective person will fault Britain for sticking to its guns on principles so fundamental.Michel Barnier won’t get his way. He and those pulling his strings seem strangely unable to digest that the Theresa May regime is gone, that voters threw out the Remainer Parliament and installed committed Brexiteers instead.We do agree with Barnier that negotiations seem dead in the water and a “no deal” looks nailed on.

Butthat is the impetus they need as a last resort to conquer their Covid fear, so be it.Normal sanctions must apply once schools go back, as even Labour agrees they must.

But they only really matterthey result in hospitalisations or deaths.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

The Government moved fast with financial help for the millions whose incomes were hit by Covid-. The self-employed and furlough schemes were hugely welcomed and the £ per week uplt in Universal Credit made a huge dference to some hard up families, but others missed out on gaining from it because of the benefit cap – being unable to work because of the lockdown meant that they couldn’t earn enough to escape the cap. But besides the extension of free school meal replacements over the summer there was nothing specically for families with children – nothing that recognised the extra costs of raising kids. So, as our survey shows, hard-pressed parents found that while their incomes were shrinking, costs were rising. During lockdown children still needed meals and they carried on outgrowing clothes and shoes. Most were worse off and half were much worse off than before the pandemic. Debt and stress levels escalated. Sadly, some parents blamed themselves for not having enough money to meet their children’s needs. Butthe pandemic has revealed anything it’s that our social security net has become too threadbare after years of cuts and freezes. It’s no longer fit for the job of protecting us when times are tough.

Government contracts are usually awarded after a tender process which allows multiple providers to compete to provide the best value. But after the Covid- pandemic struck, new rules allowed contracts worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to be handed to firms directlythey were deemed “urgent”. A spokesperson said: “Due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams, the single tender justication process was used for this contract, due to the need to urgently procure the work, in line with our procurement policy.”Public First founder James Frayne and Boris Johnson ’s top aide Dominic Cummings worked together at the Department for Education while Michael Gove was Education Secretary.Years earlier in , Mr Frayne and Mr Cummings founded an anti-EU think tank together, called the New Frontiers Foundation.

It was slow to provide protective kit, slow to protect care homes and slow to start testing. Even when they had the chance to learn from other countries, such as with the exams crisis, ministers have been caught on the hop. The shambolic efforts to reopen schools in England next month are a perfect example of mistakes not being learned from but repeated. The Government has had months to prepare for the new term, yet headteachers and parents cry out for clear guidance and support. Schools want to know what happensthere is a second spike. They want clarity on whether face coverings should be worn and how staff should interact with pupils. They also need help to pay for extra cleaning and equipment. It is not good enough for Boris Johnson to shout from the sidelines. We need him on the pitch addressing the real concerns of parents, pupils and teachers. Aid the needy  Even before the virus hit, far too many households struggled to make ends meet. Their plight has been made even worse as a result of the lockdown. An important study by the Child Poverty Group and the Church of England shows Britain’s poorest families have been left without the money to pay for food and utility bills. They are backing the Mirror’s call for an immediate increase in child benefit and the scrapping of the benefit cap. The Government has a warped sense of priorities when it is subsiding the wealthy to eat out but doing nothing to help the poorest.

Boris Johnson has said that fully reopening schools to all year groups is his top priority, amid warnings that the y closure has been damaging to children. Hundreds of thousands of youngsters have not set foot in a classroom since March following the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown, and things will look a lot dferent when they go back.Parents in England could face sanctionsthey fail to send their kids to school, Downing Street has confirmed. It is an anxious time for parents and school staff, as new measures have had to be put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. Although some year groups were able toin June, September will be the first time primary and secondary schools have been fully reopened five days a week. Here we answer some of the questions that parents have been asking, using the current government guidelines. Do you have questions or concerns about ing to school  Email us at  webnews@trinitymirror  Will I be finedI donapost send my children to school  You could be, yes. The government said it is mandatory for children to go back, unless they have very specic clinical reasons - and this will apply to a very small number. Although when schools partially reopened in March parents were told they would not face sanctions, this is not the case going into the September term. Authorities will be able to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices, in line with their codes of conduct. My child or a family member has been shielding, how are they affected  The governmentaposs shielding programme was paused at the start of August, with officials saying it is safe for children back to go to school. There may be exceptions on clinical grounds, but guidance says these will be rare. It is possible that local guidelines could be put in placeinfection rates rise in an area, however. The guidelines say: We now know much more about coronavirusand so in future there will be far fewer children and young people advised to shield whenever community transmission rates are high. Therefore, the majority of pupils will be able toto school.  Will children and staff have to wear masks in school  The government is sticking to its guns and saying it is will not make face coverings compulsory in English schools. A Number  spokesman said: “Our guidance does not recommend face masks in school, we acknowledge face coverings could obstruct communication between teachers and pupils.” Business secretary Alok Sharma said there are no plans to review this advice. The situation is dferent north of the border, with Scotland advising that secondary school pupils should wear masks in corridors, communal areas and school buses. Will school start and finishing times change  Potentially. Headteachers have been urged to considered staggered starting times in order to prevent dferent year groups congregating at the same time. The government guidance says: We know that travel to school patterns dfer greatly between schools. If those patterns allow, schools should consider staggered starts or adjusting start and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave school. Staggered start and finish times should not reduce the amount of overall teaching time.  What happensa child or staff member tests positive for coronavirus  If schools learn that a staff member or pupil has tested positive for Covid-, they must take swt action. Members of the local health protection team will assess who has been in close contact with the inidual - meaning they must self-isolate for  days. Close contact is defined as: direct close contacts - those who have had face to face contact with an infected inidual for anyof time, within  metre, including being coughed on, a face to face conversation, or skin-to-skin contact proximity contacts - those who have had extended close contact, within  to  metres for more than  minutes, with an infected inidualthose who have travelled in a car with an infected personCould my childaposs school be shutthere are a lot of cases  Yes. If there are two or more cases in  days, orabsence rates are high due to possible Covid-, a school may have an outbreak. In this case a risk assessment should be carried out and groups of pupils may be made to self-isolate. However closing schools is a last resort. The guidance says: If schools are implementing controls from this list, addressing the risks they have identied and therefore reducing transmission risks, whole school closure based on cases within the school will not generally be necessary, and should not be considered except on the advice of health protection teams.  What happensa child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school  The government says thata child becomes unwell while at school, they must be sent home immediately. If possible, the child should be moved to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, ideally with an open window. If this canapost be done, staff are advised to move them to an area at least two metres from anyone . Staff must wear PPEthey need to go within two metres of the child, and bathrooms must be cleaned and disinfected before theyaposre used by anyone . How will social distancing work  Again, looking at the governmentaposs guidance, inidual schools will have to find the approach that works best for them. The guidelines say: The overarching principle to apply is reducing the number of contacts between children and staff. This can be achieved through keeping groups separateand through maintaining distance between iniduals. But this is isnapost always easy - for younger children, the emphasis will be on keeping groups apart, for older children it will be on distancing.  Is it safe  The government has emphasised that schools must introduce enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products, such as detergents and bleach. Contact between iniduals must be minimised and social distancing maintained wherever possible. Schools will need to review their health and safety risk assessments. They will also have to employ essential measures including:a requirement that people who are ill stay at home robust hand and respiratory hygiene enhanced cleaning arrangements active engagement with NHS Test and Trace formal consideration of how to reduce contacts and maximise distancing between those in school wherever possible and minimise potential for contamination so far as is reasonably practicableMy child has complex needs that requires close contact, what will happen  The government says support will be provided as normal. While adults are advised to try and keep a distance from pupils where possible, it is recognised that this is not always possible. The guidance says:will not be possible when working with many pupils who have complex needs or who need close contact care. These pupils’ educational and care support should be provided as normal. Will school assemblies still be going ahead  There is no outright rule, but schools have been advised against it. The government says: Groups should be kept apart, meaning that schools should avoid large gatherings such as assemblies or collective worship with more than one group. Is there a risk of contracting the virus in corridors  Officials acknowledge that there is a risk, but says when passing briefly in corridors or in the playground, this is low. Schools should, however, consider staggered break and lesson times to avoid large groups congregating at entrances, exits and in corridors, they say.

Research among  small business owners found that nearly a quarter had recently taken on a family member. Of those, % had hired their partner,  per cent recruited a sibling and one in  had even sought help from their in-laws. Almost half employed relatives during lockdown because they needed extra help, while % felt their loved ones had the skills they were looking for. Other reasons included their family member wanting to gain work experience or because they were struggling to find work after finishing education during the pandemic. The research, commissioned by Funding Circle, found the family employment typically lasted seven weeks, but % still have their relative working for them now.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereAnd while % are considering taking them on full time following this experience, % would look at hiring more relatives in the future. It also emerged that as a result of this, more than a fth would like to see more traditional family businesses making a comeback. Lisa Jacobs, Funding Circleaposs UK managing director, said: Family sits at the heart of many successful small businesses. One of the silver linings of this crisis might be a revival of the traditional family business, with relatives spending more time together as business colleagues and partners as well as at home. The research also found more than a third of small business owners admitted their relative worked harder than they expected them to. More than a quarter said their relative’s working attitude was respectful and % said they seemed enthusiastic. Similarly, % of owners said working with their relation was fun and %felt it was motivating, yet % described it as dficult at times.  And although  % of those polled said taking on their loved one was positive for their family relationship, three in  struggled to be ‘boss’ to them. When it came to family perks, % of bosses admitted they gave their family member flexible hours, %offered longer breaks and %even gave them a free lunch. The findings come after a separate study of , relatives of small business owners found that of the % who were taken on by their family, a third found it motivating. Popular family businesses were found to fall into the sectors of retail, business, consulting and management, and creative arts and design. And for % of ‘employees’ the new role with their relative was something completely dferent to their usual job. For a fth, their new ‘boss’ was their dad, while a tenth had their mum to answer to and %  were ‘hired’ by their uncle. More than a third even said the experience has made them want to be more involved with the family business and % feel encouraged to start their own company. But % admitted they now realise how much work goes into running a business, according to the OnePoll figures. More than a quarter found themselves helping out a relative because they were on furlough, while % had always had an interest in it and now had the time. Positives of working for a family member included being able to act completely themselves , spending more time with familyand feeling less pressure .

Sharon Coupe, , from Edwinstowe near Sherwood Forest has always been house proud but felt like she stopped caring about her home after her diagnosis in May . The mother-of-two’s best friend was determined to help her with a DIY makeover and the two of them have spent lockdown making her home beautul again. Sharon, who has stage four bowel cancer and five tumours, said she believes there is no need to let things go just because of having cancer. She said: My house has always been beautul, but when I got diagnosed I just felt like I didn’t care what the house looked like anymore. If I was to die, nobody would say aposoh she had a lovely houseapos. But Cathie has dragged me out of my rut. We are now steadily going through the house and making it beautul again. In May , Sharon was rushed to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire the same day as having her eyes tested after the optician saw something behind her eye that was illuminating. She was referred as an ‘urgent casualty’ before being told she would need to go to Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield. Two weeks later, the support worker was told she had a tumour behind her eye and needed to undergo a ciliary flap biopsy - she had the procedure on th August . One week later, doctors confirmed the cancerous tumour behind her right eye as secondary. Sharon, who is mother to Connor, , and Aaron, , then underwent a series of tests to find the primary cancer. Sharon said:I asked the doctors not to sugar coat anything for me. But my heart sank - I had silent tears rolling down my face and all I could think of was my boys Connor and Aaron. I bought them up alone as when Connor was five, his dad and I separated but I found out I was nine weeks pregnant with Aaron. My boys are my absolute rocks.  I provided a -hour urine sample, had numerous head, shoulder and full body scans before being sent to the Western Park hospital. I also had two liver biopsies and had to stay in hospital for five nights. The results delivered the devastating news that the primary cancer was in Sharon’s bowel - but it had also spread to her liver, lungs, right eye and bones - finding five tumours in total. She was told it is an extremely rare cancer which is inoperable and incurable but hopefully treatable. Her best friend Cathie and her mother were both by Sharon’s side as the results were given to her. Sharon added: Once the professor said the primary was in my lower bowel, I askedit could be removed but he said “that’s not all” as he explained the five tumours.  The professor said in his  years of experience - he had only seen three patients with this rare cancer - Sharon being his third. Sharon hasn’t been given a timeline but says she is now stage four. In July, she underwent an MRI scan and more PET scans. The last ones had shown treatment had been successful as  of the  tumours are stable. However the tumour behind her eye is not stable - and it has grown, with a cataract over it. She recently found out that the characteristics of the tumour had changed indicating it could have spread to her brain.  She said: As for the eye - I have now been told regardlessit’s gone into my brain I have to have the eye removed as the tumour is pushing on the retina. The cancer has also spread to my skull, collar bones, manubrium, my hips, my pelvis, my spine and three disks. The results of these new scans can show even more but we have to wait and see. The-mother-of-two felt like she stopped caring about her home after she was diagnosed - despite previously being described as ‘house proud’. But the best friends have now been completing a DIY home makeover. Sharon believes there is no need to let things go just because of cancer but said she has noticed DIY work taking a lot longer due to the fatigue that comes with the disease.  She said: There’s no need at all to let things go just because you have cancer… Yes it’s taking a lot longer to do as the fatigue that comes with this disease is something you cannot describe. But we are doing this and we are getting there! We are doing one room at a time but it takes a while as I do all the wallpaper, I am up and down the ladders, Cathie has been painting and I’ve glossed all the doors.Sharon experiences horrendous fatigue and extreme side effects from treatments including hot flushes, temperature, sweating, aching and headaches.She has also had pain in her hips and lower back throughout the DIY work.  Sharon has morphine inside her   and believes she wouldnapost be able to she didn’t have the constant pain relief. Sharon is on sandostatin LAR which is injected into her buttocks muscle every three weeks. She also has an injection in her stomach every eight weeks for her bone cancer but now suffers from extremely sensitive teeth. She added: I have Calci D mg a day, docusate and senna to help with the bowel, Creon  to help with my stomach and oxy norm every  hours for pain. I am on antidepressants too as the professor said as strong as I am and as much as I am smiling whenever they see me, he thinks this will take its toll.  He said it is a lot for any one person to put up with and I now have counselling too. However the pains and medication hasn’t stopped Sharon. The best friends have been working through the house transforming one room at a time. Sharon’s bedroom cost £ and is now complete with flamingo wallpaper and pink bedding and curtains. Her bedroom took three months to complete as Sharon struggled to do the wallpapering and go up and down ladders.  The friends then moved onto another bedroom which Sharon wanted to make grey, black and silver. This was done during lockdown and took five weeks. Sharon and Cathie worked on the bedroom with the help of her two sons and a family friend Les - the transformation cost £. She said: I think the room looks so classy now. All of these rooms have been done during lockdown. I can honestly say I am loving doing all of this. It may take its toll by the end of the day and it may take longer but when it’s done the feeling I get is of great joy knowing I’ve made an effort and not just stayed in bed feeling sorry for myself all day.  Sharon has also been keeping her friends and family updated via social media and said she has been overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people. She has had ’s of cards, flowers, gts and hampers and feels there are so many people that have gone out of their way and above and beyond to support her.The mother said she gets kind messages everyday from people asking hershe needs help and said she had no idea people on Facebook were so kind and caring.However Sharon recently experienced a breakdown and her two sons surprised her by taking her to the garden. Connor and Aaron surprised their mum by pulling all the weeds up, turfing the lawn and creating a decking area with a patio for her. Her friend Cathie also planted lots of flowers and even got Sharon a sunlounger to cheer her up. She said: Connor and Aaron came to my room after three weeks of breaking down and said aposright come on mum - let’s get you up.apos They took me to my dump of a back garden and when they said open your eyes - I was amazed! My garden was beautul and it really did help and prompted me to get up and sort myself out. Sadly money hasn’t been easy for Sharon as she only qualied for statutory sick pay - having not been in her job long enough.

The baby boy was rushed to hospital for treatment and is now being cared for by his father, reports GlasgowLive. Mercy - who was an asylum seeker - lost her job after her limited leave to remain had reportedly expired, meaning she was no longer allowed to work. Mercy, , and her son were believed to have been relying on food from friends and charities. The Home Office has promised to carry out a full investigation into her case. Robina Qureshi, Director of Positive Action in Housing said: “This is the third tragedy to affect the city’s refugee population in as many months. Mercy contacted our charity on August  and said she was not getting any financial support yet had made an application to MigrantHelp. Had she lived she would have been a high priority for a crisis payment from our Emergency Relief Fund like hundreds of others left ally destitute by the asylum system. “The question remains, why are mothers and babies being left to go hungry in this city, why is it being left to charities and volunteers to pick up the pieces  Does society have anything to say about that other than call them a drain on society  The fact is there is no safety netyouaposre a refugee or migrant.

Former PC Andy Ross was dismissed after a hearing found that he breached professional standards by wooing the woman. It was said that the Wiltshire Police officer even told her what to doanyone saw them together - such as pretending she had lost her dog. The inquiry heard that PC Ross contacted the woman - known as Ms X - last year after noticing her profile online, where she said she liked unorms. He sent a picture of himself in unorm to prove he was a police officer before using his personal mobile to arrange to meet her. PC Ross, , and Ms X then met at around pm on June  after he drove to her house in a marked car - at her request. He picked her up in the vehicle and parked up in an isolated location, where they chatted, kissed and hugged. The couple also talked about what Ms X would sayanyone spotted her with a police officer, it was said. PC Ross suggested she could say she’d lost her dog and he was helping her look for it. Seven weeks later, while on duty, the officer swapped a series of raunchy messages with the woman - including suggesting they could have sex in his police car. He then picked her up from home at .pm on August  while on duty in Chippenham, Wilts., and drove to an isolated location. They parked up for ten minutes, chatted, kissed and hugged. He dropped her off at home at around .pm. Again, they talked about what she would sayanyone asked. PC Ross suggested she say she had gone to the police station to make a witness statement and even fetched a witness information notice from the boot of his car to aid the lie. Barrister Alice Meredith, for Wiltshire Police, said the constable’s actions had brought discredit on the police service and would have undermined people’s confidence in the force. He was accused of neglecting his responsibilities as a police officer and breached a specic point in the force’s code of conduct stopping officers from engaging in sexual conduct or inappropriate behaviour while on duty. She said: The officer wished to meet with Ms X having been interacting with her on a dating website. Having expressed an interest in unorms and, prior to the second meeting, discussed engaging in sexual activity involving the use of a police car, Ms X and the officer made arrangements to meet whilst the officer was on unormed duty and using a marked police vehicle. The officer sent a photograph of a marked police vehicle he was driving, drove near her home in that vehicle and then collected her and met with her in that vehicle whilst on unormed duty.

A poll of , adults found  per cent would rather not find out the exact figure they owe, and  per cent don’t want to worry about something they feel they can’t do anything about. A further  per cent don’t even bother checking their account on payday, because seeing it all fly straight out to pay the bills and debt brings them down. It also emerged one in four are more likely to worry about their physical fitness than their financial form, despite six in  adults often thinking about or fretting about money. Maitham Mohsin, head of savings at Skipton Building Society, which commissioned the research, said: “We all deal with financial stress dferently. “Some of us will face it head on while others find it a challenging problem to face which can lead to some of us choosing to ignore the problem.  “It’s interesting to see just how many people don’t know how much they owe or how much they have, hoping that the problem will resolve itself. “We understand things can be overwhelming but it’s important to start addressing our financial well-being as much as it is our physical and mental health where there has been such focus in recent months. If the problem is left alone it’s likely to get worse and impact on other aspects of le.” The study also found  per cent donapost check their bank balance on payday as they simply can’t be bothered to look. A further  per cent don’t check because they assume their employer won’t make a mistake, while one in  don’t even know how to access or get hold of their payslip in the first place.  And a tenth get disheartened by the amount of tax deducted from their gross salary. It also emerged more than one in  rarely check their account balance before making a purchase, but  per cent have had their card declined for not having enough left in their bank or building society. As many as  per cent have even been caught so off guard with their spending habits that they’ve been unable to afford an unexpected bill. However,  per cent wouldn’t dream of making a purchase without first checking how much they have squirreled away. The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found three-fths won’t bother to log their personal day-to-day spending. But of the  per cent who do watch their pounds and pennies, three in  use a banking app to keep track, while  per cent jot it down with a good, old fashioned pen and paper.  It also emerged nearly half of those polled hate talking about money and their finances, while  per cent don’t even like to think about it. And more than a quarter admitted to having a ‘bury their head in the sand’ attitude towards their cash situation. As a result,  per cent are worried about the current state of their finances, and three in  are even concerned for their financial future because they don’t feel they have everything in order.

They only told their closest family and friends and ordered takeaways from their favourite restaurants rather than going out as they got to know each other. But on October , , they couldnapost hide it any more when news of their relationship was leaked. According to a new book about the couple, Finding Freedom, the leak came someone who works for Harryaposs cousin Princess Eugenie and her dad Prince Andrew. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: The Sunday Express was going to run with the story of their relationship - and the tabloid was rumoured to have been tipped off by an employee of none other than Eugenie and her father, Prince Andrew. Eugenie is extremely close to her cousin Harry, so itaposs likely that she was upset when she found out what happened - even though it wasnapost her fault. The two royals have been very close their whole lives, with their mums Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson taking them on holiday together when they were kids. As they grew up, they took on the London clubbing scene together, sneaking into bars and doing shots together. Eugenie also played matchmaker to Harry before he met Meghan, setting him up with her actress friend Cressida Bonas. Scobie and Durand write: Eugenie has always been more than just a cousin to Harry. They were also the closest of friends. Out of all the Queenaposs grandchildren, Harry and Eugenie have one of the most natural connections. Like Harry, Eugenie is loyal, honest, and great fun. Like Harry, Eugenie also struggled to carve out her own identity growing up. Harry had always confided in his cousin when it came to the women in his le. Not only did he trust her implicitly, but friends say that she gives great advice and has always been beyond wise for her years.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

Coastguards who rescued the man, believed to be British, off the coast of Marbella have today released the image showing him wearing a le jacket over a white shirt. A spokesman for Spanish Coastguards said in a tweet: “Salvamar Vega yesterday rescued and took to Estepona a man discovered by a yacht  miles south-west of Marbella. “He was adrt on a surfboard. The man who was rescued said he had been at sea for three days after falling from a ship.” But the mystery surrounding the incident deepened today. Coastguards said he had told the yacht that spotted him and the rescue ship that took him to dry land suffering from hypothermia that he had been at sea for three days after “falling off a cruise ship or merchant vessel.” But police revealed the -year-old did not repeat his claims to them as they had taken him back to his Costa del Sol hotel after he received treatment at a local health centre. A spokeswoman for the Spanish Coastguards confirmed: “The alarm was sounded at . on Monday. “The crew of a yacht called Estelar contacted the emergency services to say they had come across a man on a surf board about  miles south-west of Marbella. “Coastguard vessel Salvamar Vega was sent from Estepona where it has its base to rescue him. “The operation was coordinated by our coastguard centre in Tara. “He was taken back to Estepona and handed over to police so he could be taken to a health centre as he was suffering from hypothermia. “He told the yacht crew and the coastguards that picked him up that he had been at sea for three days and that he had fallen off a ship he described at one point as a cruise liner and another as a merchant vessel.”  She added: “I haven’t got a full description of what he was wearing but I know he had a white shirt on. “The job of investigating what actually happened is a police job but we’ve not been aware of anyone falling or jumping from a cruise ship or merchant vessel in the area.” Responding to Spanish reports the man was British, she said: We didn’t see a passport but from the look of the man and the way he spoke, he appeared to be British.” A spokesman for the National Police in Malaga, who weren’t able to provide any immediate nationality information, said: The person in question said he was on holiday in the area and was assisted in getting back to the address where he said he was staying. “Ourhere has simply been a humanitarian one.” "},{"url":null,"title":"scientist who revealed worlds icecaps","story":"NewsScientist who revealed worlds icecaps are melting is killed by climate changeGlaciologist Konrad Steffen, , was working near the Swiss Camp research station he set up  years ago when he plunged into a crevasse created by rising temperatures in the ArcticShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsKonrad Steffen plunged into the crevasse \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Glaciologist Konrad Steffen, , was working near the Swiss Camp research station he set up  years ago when the accident happened in poor visibility. He drowned in deep meltwater at the foot of the crevasse. Ryan Neely, a University of Leeds climate scientist who studied under Dr Steffen, said crevasses in the area “were unheard-of” until recently. He said: “It looks like climate change actually claimed him as a victim.”  When Steffen, from Switzerland, first arrived in Greenland in  to set up a weather station, rising sea levels were not a huge concern, although the scientic community had agreed climate change was under way.But this changed after Steffen proved that not only were the ice sheets melting, but they were also moving and breaking up into the sea. He has yet to be proved wrong. Known as “Koni”, he set up Swiss Camp on the western edge of the ice sheet and with a growing number of colleagues and students, would set out for weather stations every morning on a snowmobile, equipped with a satellite phone, an emergency sleeping bag, and a packet of Marlboros. He only slept four hours a night, and kept going by drinking espresso after espresso. Colleague Jason Box, a climate scientist, once said: “There has been speculation among us that he isn’t actually human. Some of his students believe he has espresso running through his veins.” Dr Neely remembered once waking up in his bunk, only to hear Dr Steffen ask: “How long do you think it would take for the entire Greenland ice sheet to melt ” He had been up for hours, making back-of-the envelope calculations.  He realised the melting ice was becoming a threat which world leaders should wake up to, and former US Vice President Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, were among the politicians who visited the camp in Greenland. In , Steffen flew over the Jakobshavn Glacier and saw that its tongue had collapsed, as though “somebody had hit it with a massive hammer”. Seismographs began to pick up an increasing number of ice quakes, suggesting the ice sheet was juddering towards the sea. The temperature was rising so steeply that at first Steffen did not believe his own monitors. After  years, they indicated a rise of C. Zurich-born Steffen believed the scientic community’s predictions of sea level rise were too optimistic. In , after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted sea levels would rise by cm to cm by , Steffen said: “Unfortunately, I think we are looking more like a metre.” He told a journalist: “There will be a change coming, and obviously a change that we have not seen in thousands of years.” Because of the decline of sun-reflecting sea ice, the Arctic is thought to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This includes wearing face coverings when in shops and on regular public transport, and physical distancing.#That is why advice is being given regularly to our young people around these issues and to stress how important their actions are to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.#Steps are also taken within schools including staggering of lunches and comprehensive hygiene measures.#I would also like to take this opportunity to ask parents and families to remember to physically distance when they are dropping off or collecting their children from school.#We cannot be complacent and everyone has a part to play.#Youngsters from Viewforth High School walked in groups to Windmill Stores, where they queued up in the convenience shop and newsagent, which also sells takeaway food.The shop owner, who did not wish to be named, pointed out that he had served the local community during lockdown, making free deliveries, and relied on trade from the pupils.He said: #When we get the school kids in they make our figures better. The school has told them to wear masks.#Many pupils, but not all, wore masks as they visited other outlets on nearby Rosslyn Street.In the school’s weekly newsletter, head teacher Lisa Moore said: #Pupils are encouraged to stay on the school grounds for lunch, however,they wish to buy lunch at a local shop they should wear a face covering and be aware that service may take longer than normal.#At the town’s ASDA, pupils from St Andrew’s High School were monitored by staff at the door and all those we saw wore face coverings and walked in small groups.The school has issued several reminders to senior pupils of the rules, following discussion with the supermarket’s management.An ASDA spokesman said the branch had had no issues with pupils coming into the store without face coverings or failing to maintain a distance.He said: #We have had regular communication with the school to work together to continue encouraging pupils to social distance and wear face coverings which, as far as the store is concerned, has been a great success.#All our children in Fe have been made fully aware of how they are expected to behave when outside the school at lunchtime, particularly during this time.#Maria Lloyd, Fe Council.Kirkcaldy East Conservative councillor Richard Watt, suggested the rules for pupils on face masks were contradictory.He said: #Telling kids they need to wear masks in shops, but don’t in school, is just another example of lazy thinking from Holyrood.#Either shopkeepers aren’t at risk from kids, or teachers are.#For Ms Sturgeon the science matters less than headlines, details will be ironed out later.#For Fe Council, Maria Lloyd, head of education, said: #All our children in Fe have been made fully aware of how they are expected to behave when outside the school at lunchtime, particularly during this time.#A letter was sent to all parents asking them to remind their children that,they are leaving school to get their lunch, they must wear a face covering in shops.#This is a matter for inidual business owners to decidethey want to refuse entry.”People in St Andrews have been respectful with adhering to the rules and I have found that the school kids have not been bad at all.#Justin Hughes, Blackhorn Burgers.More than , pupils ed to Madras College in St Andrews this month and with one of the school#s buildings in the heart of the small town, local businesses were braced for the influx of lunchtime customers.When asked how the compliant pupils had been in following the guidance on social distancing and the wearing face coverings, there was a largely positive response.Justin Hughes, owner of Blackhorn Burgers on Church Street, was among those who was full of praise for their behaviour.He said: #People in St Andrews have been respectful with adhering to the rules and I have found that the school kids have not been bad at all.#On the whole, I would say we have had no issues.  Customers have to wear their mask until they sit down and the kids have been doing that.#The only thing is that they sit togetherthey are in a small group but it seems to be fine and we can’t have them all at separate tables.#Staff at other local businesses, including Korean food venue Oppa and the takeaway Dervish, were also pleased with how pupils were behaving at lunch and other break times.But employees at the local Subway branch on Market Street have had a slightly more challenging time and have found themselves having to remind pupils of the government guidance.One Subway supervisor said: #We are operating a one in, one out system and customers have to be two metres apart in the shop.#The kids are the biggest problem though and I have had to remind them about the two-metre rule and to wear their mask.#I#ll tell them when I’m here but some of the younger staff might not want to say to them and tell them to get out.#Lunchtime in Arbroath#s Keptie Street is often busy with pupils from nearby Arbroath High School.Shop owners have said the vast majority of pupils are wearing face coverings when coming into to order their meal.However one local resident said the town#s streets can often be overcrowded during lunchtime, especially as children walk to local stores in large groups.Angus Council has said parents must support schools in encouraging face coverings while pupils are out of the school.A spokesperson said: #Young people may choose to visit local shops at lunchtime but it#s important they follow national guidelines regarding safety.#This includes wearing a face covering wherever possible.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law.

Given the President is running for a second time, some iation on a theme would be permissible.The Republican convention, like the Democratsrsquo gathering, will be like nothing seen before. Such are the Covid- times. Stripped back to basics, the Democratsrsquo virtual event took some getting used to. Gone was the sales conference meets Christmas party atmosphere of old, complete with pop music and balloons. Even the firework display looked asit was trying hard to be modest.A stellar line up of speakers, led by Michelle Obama, and slick production , still made it a television event that more than  million Americans watched each night. Joe Bidenrsquos speech was well received, evenhe did not receive a big bump in the polls, and another  million was added to the partyrsquos coffers. Job done, everyone happy.Will the Republicans be saying the same come Thursday night  Whatever happens, the event is not the one the party wanted. Organisers tried to get as close to the convention norm as possible, but that plan was scrapped as the death toll from Covid- continued to soar.Instead, there will be a mix of in-person events, with an audience in Washington of no more than  people, and speeches from the key players at ious locations.On Thursday the President will accept the nomination at the White House, defying critics who say the residence should not be used for party political purposes. The First Lady, Melania Trump, will take to the podium in the White House rose garden tomorrow, hoping to follow the success of Jill Biden, who filmed a video in the school in which she once taught.Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to Mr Trump, has promised a move away from what she called the ldquodour and sour mood of the Democratic National Convention. There has already been controversy over the guest spot given to lawyers Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple from St Louis who were pictured outside their mansion pointing guns at Black Lives Matters protesters in June.Mr Trump is expected to speak every night, andhis recent White House press conferences are any guide, viewers should expect the unexpected. Not given to delivering tightly scripted addresses, the President could find himself wandering far off topic. Any over-running will not go down well with television networks and viewers waiting for their shows to start.What a change it will be for a candidate who is at his happiest when he is speaking to his base in some vast auditorium.

As with the Democrats, the partyrsquos general direction of travel will be apparent. The Democrats went for the centre ground, going heavy on the personal ndash Mr Bidenrsquos steadiness, decency, inclusiveness ndash and light on policy. It was the most positive campaign launch since Barack Obamarsquos  run.It would be the mother and father of all convention surprisesthe Republicans followed suit. Mr Trump has been trying out ious lines for size, accusing Mr Biden and his Veep nominee Kamala Harris of being prisoners of the left. A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same. Voters may accept that from a candidate, but not a President.Perhaps the best the Republicans can expect from their unconventional convention is to get through it without any major gaffes. They can then start campaigning proper where it matters, on the ground.

The polls in  showing Yes at over  per cent. The ldquosurge in SNP membership. The marches. All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.:Veteran SNP MSP calls for complete re-write of independence caseThe second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceAnd therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then. But there are signs of change and as soon as therersquos an indication that the coronavirus effect is sticking or that support for independence is reaching beyond the hard core, thatrsquos when the momentum could really get going. Thatrsquos when % could become an achievable goal. Thatrsquos when independence will become unstoppable.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland.

Mr McKay can be further assured that should such a referendum take place, he will have a second opportunity to muster further support to vote against Scotland being a sovereign country. It all seems very fair and democratic to me with no one forced to do anything, but perhaps Mr McKay thinks otherwise It is to be hoped that in their argument against independence, Unionists might wish to build their case by illustrating the specic benefits to Scotland from remaining within the Union other than the sheer incompetence of saddling us with unimaginable debt under the care of Westminster.

The political focus has been on teachers and pupils while support staff have been forgotten.ldquoYou cannot have a safeto full-time educationa signicant chunk of the workforce needed do not feel sufficiently safe, valued or heard by our decision-makers, and thatrsquos why we urge the Deputy First Minister to intervene now.Mr Swinney has already offered school and nursery staff Covid tests on demand at testing centres, but not regular workplace testing.After a series of recent Covid cases in schools in recent days, and guidance from the World Health Organisation on masks for over-s in schools, Ms Sturgeon said the Government was in the ldquofinal stages of consulting with teachers and councils about face coverings becoming mandatory in secondary school corridors and communal spaces.She said ministers were also considering whether to make masks mandatory on school transport.Ms Sturgeon said schools would have a store of masks for pupils who forgot them, but sidestepped questions on how the measure would be enforced, andpupils could be excludedthey refused to wear one.She said: ldquoWe are consulting on this specic measure because mixing between dferent groups is more likely in corridors and communal areas - increasing the potential for transmission.ldquoCrowding and close contact is more likely, and voices could be raised - resulting in greater potential for creating aerosol transmission.ldquoSo this is a position,we conclude it as we expect to do, that would reflect - and actually go slightly beyond - current WHO guidance.ldquoWe are not currently consulting on any proposals to wear face coverings in the classroom.She rejected a suggestion she should have done this sooner.She also said  positive Covid cases overnight, and no deaths.James Gillespie High School in Edinburgh, Grantown Grammar School in Grantown on Spey and Millburn Academy in Inverness have independently said masks need to be worn between classes.EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: ldquoIn situations where physical distancing is dficult, for example in busy corridors when pupils are moving between classes, use of face coverings becomes more important and we welcome the current Scottish Government consultation on this issue.However Jo Bisset, of Us for Them Scotland, said: ldquoForcing children to wear masks when therersquos little,any, scientic evidence to support [it] could be hugely damaging.ldquoIt could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma.ldquoWe also have to consider those children from unstable households who simply wonrsquot be sent to school with any mask, let alone one that is safe and effective.ldquoParents want to get their children back to school and for that experience to be as normal as it possibly can be.ldquoForced wearing of masks in the classroom, or when moving about the building, would not achieve any sense of normality for children whorsquove endured quite enough in recent months.ldquoParents want the Scottish Government and councils to rule this out.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoThis change of policy is the right thing to do and will provide an extra barrier of protection from the virus and reassurance to staff, pupils and parents.ldquoThe reality on the ground in Scotlandrsquos schools was outpacing the governmentrsquos policy and with the World Health Organisation recommending face coverings between classes and in other parts of the school estate this move is the right one.Green MSP Ross Greer said: ldquoI am pleased that the Scottish Government is finally moving to encourage the wearing of face coverings in schools.ldquoThe Greens first proposed this in June and consistently pressed the Government over the summer to strengthen their guidance, including last week at First Ministerrsquos Questions.ldquoThere is clear evidence that face coverings signicantly reduce transmission of the virus.ldquoSo it is disappointing that itrsquos taken the government so long to hear teachersrsquo concerns, rather than make this inevitable change before schools reopened.ldquoI am confused as to why the First Minister thinks masks should be worn in corridors but not classrooms though.ldquoShe canrsquot have spent much time in high schools recentlyshe thinks social distancing is going on in classes of twenty to thirty teenagers when the classrooms are no bigger than they were in March."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-asks-public-bear-us-testing","story":"The First

problems with the booking system, including people in Edinburgh being advised their nearest testing centre was in Newcastle.The BBC reported some Glasgow residents were being offered tests in Stranraer instead of Glasgow airport.Ms Sturgeon said there appeared to have been a surge in parents seeking tests for children who had shown cold symptoms after ing to school.Interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said there also appeared to have been an increase in people with no symptoms at all seeking tests.The opposition parties demandedMs Sturgeon and her ministers get to the bottom of the problem.At the daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon insisted the testing system was generally ldquoworking well, but also said officials were looking into glitches.She said: ldquoI am aware of some issues with the booking system this morning.ldquoWe have seen exceptional testing demand over the weekend and therefore we are looking right now at how we ensure that demand is properly and appropriately managed.She said officials were still investigating, but people in Scotland may have ldquoerroneously been directed to testing centres in England rather than the next available slot in Scotland.The First Minister continued: ldquoOur testing system is obviously working, itrsquos working well, but as demand increases or at periods of high demand bear with us as we resolve and understand any particular issues.She said anecdotal accounts suggested many parents were taking their children to be tested after they developed coughs.She said: ldquoWersquore going into a part of the year when people could have other illnesses and viruses that present with similar symptoms to Covid.ldquoSo we expect to see demand for testing increasing as we go into the autumn and winter and there will undoubtedly be peaks in that demand period.Dr Smith said it was not uncommon to see more cases of coughs or colds as children ed to school after the summer.He said: ldquoI think itrsquos inevitable that as you bring people back together, particularly as you restart schools, you get a rebound in the volume of respiratory symptoms.As a GP for many years, this was very common whenever schools went back.He said anyone with coronavirus symptoms should immediately book a test and self-isolate. However those were asymptomatic should book a test onlyadvised to do so by the Test and Protect team.Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: ldquoItrsquos not right that some people are being sent on -mile round-trips and across the border for a Covid test.ldquoWersquove been hearing from constituents that testing sites are struggling to cope with demand, and test results that should be delivered in  hours are taking several days.ldquoYoung people and teachers have already had their lives disrupted considerably.Itrsquos vital that they can get back to work and school as safely and as soon as possible.ldquoI urge the Scottish Government to find out whatrsquos gone wrong here and work quickly to maintain public confidence in the testing system.Labour MSP Monica Lennon said: ldquoSomething has gone horribly wrong that Scots are being sent to Belfast and Cumbria for Covid- tests.ldquoOnly last week the Health Secretary said that testing is key to actively hunting down the virus - but instead people are having to hunt down a test.ldquoIt isnrsquot good enough and the Scottish Government needs to fulfil its promises on testing.Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ldquoThis is an extremely concerning development. We know how important it is to test quickly and contain the spread of this virus.ldquoPeople need to have trust in the system and be provided with accurate information about the nearest test centre.ldquoIt would be disastrouspeople displaying symptoms travel longer distances than they should.ldquoThe Health Secretary must get to the root of this problem urgently. We canrsquot afford for the system to fall down whenever demand increases.SNP Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny said people in his area had been offered tests in Northern Ireland.He said: ldquoMy casework over the weekend highlighted that there has been a clear upsurge in demand for testing.ldquo However itrsquos not acceptable that people in Inverclyde are being asked to travel outwith our area to get a test when there is a test centre in Inverclyde.ldquoIt beggars belief that the UK Governmentrsquos test system was asking our community to travel to Northern Ireland to receive a test.ldquoEven discounting that utterly unacceptable situation, itrsquos also not good enough to expect people to travel to sites in Lochgilphead and Edinburgh.ldquoWe must have testing in our

Someone in the future wishes the planet ill, but how can anyone in the present stop him So we go down the rabbit hole with writer-director Nolan. He certainly serves up the full cinematic experience. The first thing you notice is how LOUD everything is. Ludwig Goranssonrsquos heart-pounding soundscape is the backdrop to thrilling car chases, shoot-outs with bullets flying backwards, explosions, and a fight involving a cheese grater . This is Nolan on typically spectacular form. Who needs Netflix on the telly now The cast is first class, from relative newcomer John David Washington as the Protagonist to his crime-fighting partner Neil . Acting everyone  off the screen is Kenneth Branagh as a megalomaniac Russian oligarch, with Elizabeth Debicki as his cowed we.All terric, but then we come to the story. A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma is just the start of it. Adding to the confusion is dialogue that for long stretches is impossible to make out. There is clever, and there is too clever by half. Nolanrsquos tale is the latter, and his picture is poorer for it."},{"url":null,"title":"salmond-inquiry-top-official-jokes-500-000-blunder","story":"Nicola Richards, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound,-a-year Director of People, told MSPs one of the lessons she had learned was ldquoget another job.In early , Mr Richards appointed aninvestigating officer toexamine two complaints of sexual misconduct against AlexSalmond related to his time as First Minister.Under the Governmentrsquos harassment complaints policy, this official should have been wholly unconnected to the allegations.HoweverMs Richards appointedJudith Mackinnon, who had been in prior contactwith the two accusers, tainting the entire exercise.Thisled to Mr Salmond winning a judicial review at the Court of Session and having the investigation set aside as unlawful, unfair and ldquotainted by apparent bias.Taxpayers were left with a pound, bill for Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs, and a Holyrood inquiry is now looking at what happened.Last week, the Governmentrsquos top official, the Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, appeared at the inquiry and apologised ldquounreservedly for the ldquoprocedural failure involved.She said lessons had already been learned as part of work led by Ms Richardsrsquos People Directorate.Referring to Ms Evansrsquos evidence, SNP MSP Angela Constance asked Ms Richards: ldquoSo what have you learned Laughing, she replied: ldquoA lot.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

At the moment people cannot even apply for a test, she said. I understand some of those young people have been told it could be next year before they will be able to take a driving test.It has also revealed that learner drivers who were due to sit a driving test in Craigavon are being sent to Armagh and Lisburn instead.This situation is untenable and places local motorists at a distinct disadvantage, said Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: The DVA has worked hard to restore services and communicate the facts to all customers. It is vitally important that health and safety is put first while working to minimise disruption.On July  the minister announced that the DVA is planning to resume some practical car and lorry driving tests from September . The DVA holds the contact details of around , driving test candidates who are either key workers, or who had a test booked and cancelled in late March to the end of June. When driver testing resumes around  key workers will be tested first.The DVA estimates it will take six to eight weeks to clear the backlog. A further update will be provided to advise when it is opening its booking system for all new customers.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all.

Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Declan Devine has insisted that his players are ready as the clock ticks down towards this evenings Europa League tie with FK Riteriai in Vilnius. The Candystripes boss and his squad left Derry yesterday and flew directly to Lithuania where they have put in place their final preparations for this evening’s game against the Knights, with victory meaning over pound, to the club. City got back to winning ways at the weekend with a deserved - win over Cork City at the Brandywell, a victory which came at the exact right time for Devine and his team who have struggled since football resumed last month. googletag.cmd.push Devine was part of the City management team which flourished on the continent in  against IFK Gothenburg, Gretna and Paris St. Germain and knows full well the joy of winning at the highest level. “Its one of the highlights of your season and something that you reflect back on,” he said. “Some of the European ties Ive been involved in, both with this club and other clubs, have been highlights and memories that live with you for a long time. When you reflect back you want to remember winning thats the ultimate one because you want to progress through a round. googletag.cmd.push “Our recent history, barring Aberystwyth, hasnt been great. Weve qualied which is a sense of achievement, but we have to try and strive to be better we have to get through a round or two and try and make sure its a regular occurrence that we are playing in these types of games.” Devine has dismissed any notion that FK Riteriai are there to be beaten on Tuesday, with the Lithuanians struggling badly in their domestic league. Riteriai have played  league games in A Lyga this season, and won just one game, losing  in the process. Yet Devine believes that their league performance is not a fair reflection of the quality within the team. “This is a tough game,” he said. “Ive watched a lot of them, they are technically very good footballers, but we are going out to try and win a game. We have to be at our very, very best, as everyone has to be in Europe. We cant afford an off night because the stakes are so high. We want to be in this competition for more than  minutes so its all about the performance on the night. “This season has been absolutely nuts. I’ve never seen anything like in in  years in football. Its not something that we really enjoy playing in front of empty stadiums, but its a game of football, its a -minute game that could potentially could go to  minutes and penalties. There are no excuses, we have got to perform on the night and Ive every confidence the boys can do that.”                                                                                    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There have been some fantastic European adventures at the club over the years and ahead of this season’s Europa League adventure, we look back on some of the biggest nights in Derry City history.  September ,  Derry City , Benfica  The city came to a standstill on Wednesday, September  as Benfica, one of the true European powerhouses, arrived at the Brandywell, with Portugues legend Eusebio in tow. Derry City held their own for an hour but the class of Benfica shone through as they opened the scoring. Benfica substitute Vata got down the wing and crossed and although Vaudequin headed clear, the ball came to Swedish international Jonas Thern, who took a touch before driving the ball across the face of goal and past Tim Dalton into the corner from  yards. googletag.cmd.push Just five minutes later Benfica doubled their lead. Paniera’s corner caused pandemonium in the City penalty area and although Aldair’s shot was blocked, the loose ball came to Ricardo, whose shot beat Dalton, only to be headed off the line by Kevin Brady. The referee’s assistant raised his flag and signalled that the ball had crossed the line and referee Guy Goethals awarded the goal. Derry City were now up against it but on  minutes the Brandywell was brought back to le. Liam Coyle’s through ball sent Felix Healy in behind the Benfica defence and his left-footed shot across goal beat Silvinho, only to bounce back off the base of the post. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately for Derry, the loose ball ran into the path of Paul Carlyle, who kept his composure to drill the ball into the vacant goal from  yards. The fans exploded into le. Derry City were back in the tie. For all their efforts though, McLaughlin’s team could not get the equaliser in the closing stages, but their showing against one of the strongest teams in Europe was not lost on their supporters, who gave them a standing ovation after the game.  August ,  Derry City , Lokomotiv Sofia  Felix Healy’s Derry City side were expected to be second best in their Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Lokomotiv Sofia, the full-timers from Bulgaria. Those fortunate to bag a ticket for the game were to witness a truly historic day at the Brandywell as Derry finally got their first European win as a League of Ireland team. . The only goal of the game came just before half time when Sofia goalkeeper Ruman Apostolev misjudged a cross from Harry McCourt and the ball flicked off the underside of the crossbar before being cleared. However, the linesman signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and much to the dismay of the visitors, the goal was awarded. McCourt’s goal proved to be enough and the final whistle brought memorable scenes at the Brandywell, with a whole generation of City fans seeing their team victorious in European competition for the first time.  August ,  Apoel Nicosia , Derry City  Just two days after facing Barcelona at the Brandywell, the Candy Stripes were in Cyprus for their UEFA Cup tie against Apoel Nicosia and it proved to be a signicant occasion as Derry City finally hit an away goal in a European tie. It had taken almost  years for the Brandywell club to achieve such a feat, with games against Cardf City, Benfica, Vitesse Arnhem, Lokomotiv Sofia and Maribor all drawing a blank. The right man in the right place proved to be none other than Gary Beckett, who scored on the stroke of half time to cancel out Wojciech Kowlczyk’s earlier effort. Nicosia went on to win the game - thanks to Stelios Okkarides’ second half strike, but the crucial away goal meant that Dermot Keely’s side were still in with a chance of progression ahead of the home tie at the Brandywell.  July ,  IFK Gothenburg , Derry City  The great result in the club’s history  Every Derry City fan will be able to say where they were and what they doing when news filtered through from Sweden that the Candy Stripes had beaten IFK Gothenburg on their own patch. For those lucky enough to be in attendance at the Ullevi Stadium, it was scarcely believable and tales of the celebrations which followed the final whistle became as legendary as Sean Hargan’s winning goal. The game was still in the balance until the th minute when Derry ventured forward and won a corner. In a moment never to be forgotten by the small number of Derry City fans in attendance, Kevin Deery floated a corner into the penalty area where Sean Hargan jumped highest to send the ball back across goal and into the net. It was an unstoppable header. With time running out, goalkeeper David Forde produced arguably his two best saves in a Derry City shirt, two world class saves in the space of a minute to keep Gothenburg at bay.  August ,  Gretna , Derry City  Another amazing result, another amazing night for Derry City as  Candystripes packed into Motherwell’s Fir Park to watch a demolition. It all went to plan for Gretna in the opening stages of the game and a nervy start from the Candy Stripes was punished when they fell behind as Ryan McGuffie scored after just eight minutes. Midway through the first half, things started to go wrong for the hosts as Derry City equalised, Darren Kelly meeting the ball with a firm header, sending it into the net to level the tie with a vital away goal. The teams remained level at half time, but Derry City were out again quickly, and in one of the most stunning halves in the club’s history, they blew Gretna away with an incredible display of attacking football. Two brilliant goals from Kevin Deery, including a blistering -yard free kick, put City in control but there was still ore to come. Derry took advantage of a stunned Gretna, Ciaran Martyn scoring two brilliant inidual goals, right in front of the City fans, who were in dreamland.  September ,  Derry City , Paris St. Germain  September  was a huge date in the history of Derry City Football Club as the mighty Paris St. Germain arrived at the Brandywell to great fanfare. The game itself produced another valiant performance from the Candy Stripes, as they showed respect, but no fear, to their glamourous opponents. Twice in the opening stages Killian Brennan came close, shooting just wide before sending a magnicent shot from  yards onto the crossbar. But as the game went on, the French side began to settle and Brennan had to be a hero at the other end as he cleared the ball off the line after Fabrice Pancrate’s header had beaten David Forde. Darren Kelly then cleared the ball off the line a second time as PSG took control and Derry were glad to survive until half time. Perhaps the game’s defining moment came just after the break when Kevin McHugh broke into the PSG penalty area and was brought down. Everyone in red and white screamed for a penalty but Slovakian referee Richard Havrilla said no. It wasn’t to be, but a - draw kept Derry in with a fighting chance ahead of the second leg in Paris.  July ,  Aberystwyth , Derry City  Derry City produced arguably their best performance of the  season, as they hit five in a Europeaan away game for the second time in  years. Leading - from the first leg, City showed no mercy. They cruised into a - lead within  minutes. Headed goals from Michael Duffy and Barry McNamee ended the tie as a contest but City were far from finished. A second half hat trick from Rory Patterson, the third of which was a cheeky penalty dinked down the middle, secured an outstanding - win on the night, and a - victory on aggregate. The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

hard to fit the journey in with their routine, forcing many, including young mothers with children, to pay for taxis or even walk to Ardglass for something as simple as a pint of milk.BALLYNAHINCH

Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is unfair. “I have raised this with the Minister and asked her to urgently review this decision and to quickly reinstate these test.I have requested a meeting with her so that the instructors can highlight their concerns.”Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd called for the opening of temporary driving test facility in Craigavon while the normal center is used for Covid  testing.Mr O’Dowd said: “While I welcome the commencement of Driving Tests across the North I have to express my disappoint they will not be recommencing in Craigavon. I understand the use of the current center for Covid  testing rules out this facility however other facilities could be used to keep tests in the Craigavon area.“I have written to Minister Mallon and asked for other options to be explored and another venue identied to allow learner drivers to complete their tests.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
