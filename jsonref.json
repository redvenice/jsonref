It\u0027s fairly rare that we do get them in the day time, because they\u0027re usually seen prior to getting into town.’         The adolescent creature was spotted by shocked Churchill, Manitoba by resident Danielle Daley, who looked up out the window from her desk on October 9 to see the white bear giving two conservation officers the run around         Daley watched on in disbelief as the officers gave the bear chase, before they were eventually able to successfully drug the 200 pounder and capturing it after 15 minutes. The bear has been taken to a holding facility, in accordance with protocol, and will eventually be relocated 40 kilometres north of Churchill via helicopterHe added that he and the other officer had difficulty cornering the bear because, though the diamond is fenced off, it has a number of gateways around the perimeter that the bear could escape through.The rare encounter also attracted a large crowd who came out to watch the bear, forcing officers to make quick decisions in the interest of public safety.‘In a situation like this, where there are people around, it can be dangerous,’ Windsor said. ‘You don\u0027t want to push the bear to where there\u0027s people, so the decision was made to dart the bear. That would be the safest thing to do.’Bears in Churchill are waiting for the summer ice to come in on Hudson\u0027s Bay to hunt for seal, and the town lies between the bears\u0027 summer dens and the bay.‘Our top priority is the safety of people, that\u0027s the first priority that we have with the polar bear alert program.

He was 25, and engaged in an all-consuming personal project to capture the essence of “the English way of life … before it becomes more Americanised”. A precocious talent, Ray-Jones had won a scholarship from the London School of Printing to study at Yale School of Art when he was 19. He befriended the freewheeling young stars of American photography, Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz, was mentored by Richard Avedon and returned home in 1965 with notebooks full of strategy. “Get more involved (talk to people),” began one typical list of these notes to self. “Stay with the subject matter (be patient). See if everything in the background relates to the subject matter. NO MIDDLE DISTANCE.”With these principles in mind, Ray-Jones took himself off in a camper van in search of Englishness. He found a good deal of it on beaches – windbreaks and frigid paddling and Thermoses balanced on shingle – and at all levels of pageantry, from Glyndebourne and the Chelsea flower show to local beauty parades and fun fairs. This photograph, in which the horse takes more interest in the cafe than the cafe takes in the horse, was typical of his eye.Tony Ray-Jones died of a sudden and aggressive leukaemia in 1972, his project unfinished. His pictures had achieved a significant following among younger photographers. Among them was Martin Parr, then a student at Manchester Polytechnic, who was “enthralled and excited” by Ray-Jones’s perfectly realised comedies of English manners and took inspiration from them in his own vocation. Parr includes this photograph in a book of Ray-Jones’s English pictures and an exhibition at his foundation. The book stands, he hopes, as a definitive tribute to Ray-Jones’s “ability to make complex images in which every element falls into place”.The English Seen by Tony Ray-Jones is at Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, Wednesday to 21 December.

As Atwood has said, with women’s rights increasingly under threat in the US, the world seems to be moving closer to Gilead rather than further away. The book is gripping, pacy and beautifully written, though later sections in which two young women take on the patriarchy devolve into action adventure closer to the spinoff television series than to the austere mood of Atwood’s original.But another novel called to the judges, too, leading to the shock decision to “break the rules”, as the Booker’s literary director Gaby Wood complained at the press conference, by sharing the prize between Atwood and the British author Bernardine Evaristo, whose Girl, Woman, Other is a landmark in fiction of a different kind.To honour Evaristo’s novel, which intertwines 12 narratives about black women in Britain, is to shine a much-deserved spotlight on an author who has blazed a trail in subject matter and style for a quarter of a century. Today, British publishing is at last eager for erse voices: Evaristo’s whole oeuvre, she says, has been an answer to the question: “What does it mean to not see yourself reflected in your nation’s stories?”The Testaments is a global bestseller, whereas Girl, Woman, Other is a brilliantly topical but leftfield novel crying out for a publicity push. It unspools in a freewheeling, endlessly flexible free verse patterned as thoughts flickering between past and present rather than as punctuated sentences. This is an ingenious device that beams the reader right into the mind of each of the 12 narrators – from farmer Hattie to theatre director Amma, banker Carole to supermarket supervisor LaTisha. Evaristo has always been ahead of the curve on gender and sexuality as well as race: Amma is a polyamorous lesbian, while MeganMorgan has explored the trans spectrum and arrived at a “gender-free” position. The politics of the book are passionately upfront, but repeatedly undercut by sly humour.Evaristo purposefully draws her people in bold brushstrokes, with almost soapy storylines – the prose may be experimental, but the readerly pleasures of character and plot are very traditional. It is a life-enhancing, horizon-expanding novel: funny, inventive and fizzing with vitality.Two extraordinary books, then: but it has to be said that this feels like a fudge, weighing a huge event novel against a more obscure choice and trying to have it both ways. The danger is that the Booker effect that propelled last year’s “difficult” winner, the brilliant Milkman, to a wider readership will be dissipated. Perhaps it’s best understood as a reminder of how impossible it is, in the end, for the subjective process of weighing one novel against another to come to an objective conclusion.• Justine Jordan is the ’s fiction editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32eb393650a16a0eeb0f8ff1e175cfbbde9e0feb/75_0_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6307930edcc4bb8610b1b60d5dbc70f","title":"tell us about your eurostar experiences","story":"The international railway service celebrates 25 years since the first train travelled underneath the Channel.

Genesis had been at the BBC for eight years, but this was different: “I felt what I was hearing was missing voices and perspectives,” she says.The city itself also offered a rich source of inspiration. “I love DC. There is so much art there, it’s got a massive African-American community, a huge intellectual community, and it’s great for jazz and dance music.”After that six-month trip, Genesis, 33, returned to London and founded her arts and culture podcast Stance. “I’ve always liked the immediacy of sound. You can really tell stories with radio,” she says. “Our listeners tend to be people who love arts and culture but like it to be grounded in something real. We love extraordinary stories.”Voices and stories from around the world are something Genesis says she grew up immersed in on her estate in Brixton. “We had Asian neighbours, South American, English, West African, Eastern European – friends from all around. It’s part of who I am. And it makes me curious about different cultures, ideas and experiences.”Genesis’s grandfather moved to Brixton from Jamaica in 1952. “My nan was white British and my grandad was Jamaican – my mum and her siblings were some of the first mixed-race kids around our area,” she says. “Growing up in that culture had a real impact on me.”There is a significant part of Jamaican culture that is associated with Clarks. “Clarks is such a staple for Jamaican people. When we’d visit, we would bring shoes for the family and they would love you forever,” says Genesis. “My late dad had amazing style and he would wear Clarks desert boots that he’d get from their Brixton store. I actually have an amazing book called Clarks in Jamaica by Al Fingers and I love that book. There is also the Vybz Kartel tune called Clarks, which is on a lot of playlists in my house. Clarks has a special place in the hearts of Jamaicans.”When asked how she would describe her everyday style, Genesis considers for a moment before deciding on “layers and layers of black”. But, she adds, she does love to change it up when she can with colourful clothing, shoes and jewellery, which she finds on her travels, mostly in secondhand shops in the US.The power of travel is deeply woven into Genesis’s storytelling. “Sitting in a studio isn’t how I prefer to tell stories I love to take the listeners with me. I recently went to Manchester to make a show about the city’s LGBTQ story. We visited Mumbai in India as well as LA, New York and Philadelphia in the USA. We covered a band based in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who use found objects to make their sound – that innovation was incredible.“I’m lucky because I’ve got family and friends all around the world, and I’m always talking to them, or visiting,” she says, adding that this is reflected in her style and her work.ReadingPonti by Sharlene Teo – the way she portrays girlhood is refreshing.

Iconic classics that stand the test of time are the ultimate rebuff to “What was I thinking?” fads. Here, we reveal the timeless prints, styles and colours you’ll want to wear again and again.From snake to zebra, plus a few tigers on the prowl, the collections walked on the wild side this season. But leopard knocks the spots off every other print. Why? It’s universally flattering, powerful, seductive and, most likely, already in your closet.If only real life was as rose-tinted as the catwalks, where this most feminine of hues proliferated in shades from millennial to bubblegum and beyond. Is the use of pink a celebration of girl power, a protest, or simply a delicious pop of colour? If you ask us, it’s all three.The bourgeois tweed blazer, the rainproof mackintosh, a tartan wool coat: check autumnwinter outerwear off your list. Throw in argyle and houndstooth for the full compendium of this brilliantly British trend.The ultimate nine-to-five look in the 1960s and 1970s, the gloriously girly pussy-bow blouse has stood the test of time, with contemporary fans including Kate Middleton and Amal Clooney. Team yours with a midi skirt and boots for polished perfection or high-rise jeans and loafers for nonchalant chic.Say yes to the (midi) dressSeen at: Celine, Dior, Chloé, Dries Van Noten, Erdem, Fendi, Givenchy, Helmut Lang, Hermes, RoksandaVersatile and flattering, a great midi dress can take you from the office to a party in any season. Getting maximum mileage out of a midi is all about the styling: go casual with ankle boots and a biker jacket, or up your game with 1970s stack heeled knee-highs and a trench.Military is the ultimate ally in men’s fashion, as timeless as a pair of Clarks shoes, and it works in a full battalion of styles. Start with the classic trench, relax with a pair of cargo pants, make a statement in a flying jacket and rely on khaki as your go-to shade for everything.Fifty shades of greySeen at: Dior Homme, Dries Van Noten, Louis Vuitton, Valentino, Prada, LemaireGrey is the ultimate neutral – it goes with everything, works in every format, and can be endlessly reworn. But if you only have three grey garments, go for a charcoal suit, a crisp grey T-shirt and a classic knit.Depend on denimSeen at: Marni, Margaret Howell, Off-White, E TautzDenim as a fashion stalwart? You don’t say. This season, denim is on especially good form the autumnwinter catwalks were loaded with oversized denim – a welcome reprieve from the bad old days of the sprayed-on skinny jean.Take the biscuitSeen at: Burberry, Dries Van Noten, Zegna, Fendi, Lemaire, Loewe, Rochas, Ferragamo, WooyoungmiCustard cream. Malted milk. Bourbon. There’s a delicious hint of the biscuit barrel to the new season’s palette, so layer up in cosy neutral shades as the weather cools.Drop your vision of an irate football manager in a duvet coat – if you shop clever, a padded jacket is a stylish, hardy perennial.

There are really more important things than women. And the Labour party. There is Brexit, the Queen’s speech, voter suppression, almost every other issue – and the unfettered egos of Boris Johnson and the posh bouncer Dominic Cummings. And there is the Brexit party on the sidelines, with its Stepford Wives view of femininity.This is not the time to think about that “single issue” of female representation, because everything else is more urgent. Except, actually, there is no policy that doesn’t affect the majority of the population – women. And there is no future for Labour unless it attracts women voters. When John McDonnell spoke of shortening the working week, which is great, I wondered how this plays out in the double shift of paid work and domestic work that is most women’s lives. Jeremy Corbyn’s power is leaking away. No simple chant can bring it back – and if you want to call me a Tory for saying so, more fool you. Polls, schmolls.The process of putting him out of his misery has already started. McDonnell is taking control. “I’m still of the view now that whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman,” he says. But how much Labour wants to elect a female leader is debatable. It feels more like it is being embarrassed into it because the Tories have had two and even the very male-dominated Lib Dems have managed one.This is not an argument about women being better, or even helping other women. It is an argument about basic representation. The sudden argument from some pundits that representative democracy is in crisis? Well, hello: for some of us it has been in crisis for decades. Its institutions are not fit for purpose. The Labour party does not stand outside this.Misogyny, openly weaponised by Johnson with his contemptible reply of “humbug” to the female politicians who live daily with death threats and panic buttons, is not in question on the right. On the left, though, particularly that part of the left Corbyn represents, it is rife. Once you take a position of moral superiority and declare yourself anti-racist, ant-sexist and most of all, anti-capitalist, you don’t actually have to give up your own power or do anything about it: you know the tune just hum the words. Just as antisemitism has been repeatedly ignored, so too has sexism, because loyalty is valued over self-reflection.Of course there are some brilliant women in the Labour party, but few remain in the inner circle and some of these are finally breaking rank. I never expected much from the type of guys who visit Cuba without noticing it’s a police state, where prostitution is rife and ordinary people cannot buy ibuprofen. Or the people who denied the corruption in Venezuela. I have known such revolutionaries all my life.What has been shocking, though, is that even for the sake of “optics” they will not address the clear and present anti-women bias in their midst: from the all-male shortlists for their elected mayors – Sion Simon, Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram – to the dreadful online abuse directed at any woman who challenges Corbyn. (Think of a woman who has given her life to the Labour party, such as Angela Eagle.) The leadership position on rape allegations and sexual harassment is that no outside body needs to be involved this can be done with an internal inquiry. All this while the Corbyn outriders call any woman who disagrees with them a centrist melt. Or things I can’t say here. Then there is the list of women MPs now facing deselection. How do they think this looks?It’s amusing to see Alastair Campbell spar with McDonnell over having a female leader. I really thought there could be no more monotonously laddish leadership than New Labour and its football schtick. I was wrong. But the retro machismo of Labour conference this year was abhorrent.A female leader is only part of the answer, though. There is something rotten at the core of this administration that comes out of a political formation that has never prioritised women. Like many other failing political institutions where no one cares about gender, everyone just wants the best person for the job – and it always happens to be a bloke. Labour knows it has to change. Too little, too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67d77a26a1d3fd7f36a80dacdb5b72ac51188405/0_34_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2894822bd6e06e925c1fd8536160f5b0","title":"the guardian view on the queens speech show without substance","story":"Rarely has the elaborately costumed pageant of the state opening of parliament looked less in keeping with the status of the legislative programme on offer. This was pomp in bizarre circumstances.From the off, the Queen’s speech struck a curiously provisional note, beginning with the statement that the government’s priority “has always been” to leave the EU on 31 October. That was some way short of a commitment that this is going to happen, which is understandable. No one knows what is going to happen between now and the end of the month.Given the Conservatives’ lack of a majority, and the showdown with MPs that is expected whether or not the government and EU are able to strike a deal before Thursday’s deadline, the contents of the speech are less pertinent to Britain’s immediate future than the continuing talks in Brussels. The nation on Monday suffered the unedifying spectacle of the Queen reading out a Boris Johnson wishlist.But even if none of the 26 promised bills find their way on to the statute books, the speech was interesting – and dispiriting – for what it reveals about our ruling party, with a general election widely expected to be triggered within a few months at the latest.The immigration bill ending freedom of movement, and several others, hinge upon the outcome of this week’s negotiations. For the rest, seven bills in the area of law and order, including longer sentences for foreign criminals convicted of breaching deportation orders, contain remarkably little fresh thinking. Instead, they are a retread of the authoritarian and anti-immigration policies of Margaret Thatcher, as previewed in the recent party conference speech by the home secretary, Priti Patel. At the end of a decade of cuts to police and criminal justice budgets under successive Tory prime ministers, when the murder rate has risen sharply and youths in particular are at greater risk of serious violence than for many years, this retro emphasis on retribution, at the expense of prevention and rehabilitation, is worthy of contempt.Proposals for compulsory voter ID are similarly objectionable, and not only because poorer people, who are less likely to be Conservative voters, will find it hardest to comply. All the available evidence shows that election fraud in the UK is vanishingly rare. The very last thing the UK needs is for people’s faith in democracy to be further eroded.The UK urgently needs to limit air and water pollution, so the commitment to new environmental legislation is welcome. So is the return to the House of Commons of the domestic abuse bill that risked being lost with Mr Johnson’s failed prorogation. The creation of a new buildings regulator, provided it has the necessary powers and resources, should help to ensure that there is never a repeat of the Grenfell Tower disaster.But whether it is judged as a programme for government, or as a preview of a general election manifesto, this Queen’s speech was mainly notable for what it left out. On social care, tenants’ rights, schools funding and the climate emergency in particular, there can be no excuses for a ruling party that does not offer substantial proposals. Brexit or not, such critical issues must not be allowed to drift on, unaddressed, any longer.The shortest parliament in living memory opened in March 1974 with Harold Wilson’s promise to put the country’s membership of the European Economic Community to a referendum. So far Mr Johnson has resisted calls to put his own plans for quitting Europe to a fresh public vote. But with this new parliament likelier than not to beat 1974’s record for brevity, Monday’s Queen’s speech makes it more than ever apparent why the worst possible outcome of any election would be a majority Conservative government led by Mr Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8987ef6ede9b8b93d1dfdf12c20912db7315b5c/581_544_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56f5e133a57597265b607c37ac79ed7d","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dawn","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dawn’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dawn’.Share your photos of what dawn means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 16 October at 10am.

Real-life Arachne clues are the basis for a key conversation between Tom (played by Chris O’Dowd) and Louise (Rosamund Pike) before a session of marriage counselling – and the content of the clues is awkwardly appropriate.Unlike with fellow BBC series Inside No 9, this was not a conspiracy. So had Hornby pored over dozens of cryptics to find clues that reflected a marriage under strain? No, he recalls: it was serendipity. “Those clues all appeared on the day I was writing that particular episode.” Hornby is, it transpires, a devotee of this paper’s puzzles. “I love the  crossword and have been a solver for many years – no other newspaper comes close.”And what of Tom’s horror at solving on a printed-out A4 sheet, rather than in the paper proper? This is, it seems, the product of experience. “I don’t like doing crosswords on screens or on PDF unless I have to – when I’m travelling, for example.”Arachne herself was tickled to be told by a pal – Supertramp’s John Helliwell – that she had a cruciverbal cameo. “It’s a gem of a series, as you’d expect from Frears and Hornby,” she says.“We tried to follow Lucy Mangan’s advice and pace ourselves, but ended up bingeing the whole lot in one go,” she says. And yes: as she told us was common in a Q\u0026ampA, she had no memory of composing the quoted clues.Finally, what next for Hornby and cryptics? “One day I would like to set a crossword, but I wasn’t tempted to write the clues myself,\u0027” he says. “It would have taken me hours.” Well, when the time comes, this is a puzzle I would like to see. For the writing and rewriting of clues, the author could, I have discovered, rely on the support of a stalwart setter – Arachne.More crosswords in fiction:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ec85a5aa4aff49bbc344aad1c13a2c9549d260/0_151_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0043ae22d94798965456704de2d3ed43","title":"pupils propelled out school system home education ofsted report","story":"Breakdown in parent-school relations is driving surge in home education, Ofsted finds Pupils in England are being propelled out of schools and into home education, sometimes in the space of a single day, with little or no discussion beforehand and often without consulting the child, according a report by the schools watchdog.In some cases pupils are moved so quickly they are not even able to say goodbye to their friends. In other cases, parents complained that schools refused to allow children who were leaving to be educated at home to take their schoolwork with them.The Ofsted report, which focuses on schools and families in seven local authorities in the east Midlands, attempts to shed light on the recent surge in the number of children leaving school for “elective” home education.In all the cases that formed part of Ofsted’s research, there had been a breakdown in the relationship between parents and schools and many families were left with the view that home education was the only option for their child.The children affected are often those with complex special needs, which many schools are no longer able to meet because of budget cuts. The report also looks at the issue of “off-rolling”, where children are unofficially removed from school rolls to boost results.“Unfortunately, our evidence suggests that letting children go can be an easy option for schools,” the report says. “We cannot say for certain whether there were any cases of off-rolling. Our research did find examples that support other evidence that parents have been coerced into moving to home education.“For example, one local authority had previously received letters from parents asking to move a child to home education that were written on school-headed paper but signed by parents.”The report finds evidence that some parents are choosing home education to avoid prosecution for non-attendance and permanent exclusion, often the result of a child’s needs not being met at school. “I have been forced into doing it because there was no other option,” one parent told Ofsted. “If I didn’t, I’d end up with a fine or prison.”Far from being a positive choice, home education is usually a last resort for parents who are often unprepared and ill-equipped to provide their children with a suitable education, according to the report. Ofsted said home education was “a huge undertaking” for parents, who frequently complained of a lack of support.“There’s no help, not even paper,” one parent told inspectors. “I’ve not got the experience or funds for home schooling and I’ve made that clear to the authorities. So my daughter is receiving nothing at all,” said another.The report expresses concern about the speed at which decisions to home educate are made and the lack of planning to support such a dramatic change in a child’s life. “In extreme circumstances, moving a child to home education took as little as a day,” the report says. “For example, after one parent heard about the possibility of home education, their child said: ‘Mum took me out of school the next day.’”The Ofsted chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said home education was a legitimate parental choice and could be positive for a child where parents are well-equipped to provide a good education.“However, children should not be moved to home education simply to resolve difficulties in school,” she said. “Schools, local authorities and parents need to work together before such a decision is made, to make sure that home education is genuinely in the interests of children and not just the best thing for schools or parents.“It’s vital that parents are fully informed about the alternatives, and that they understand all the implications and costs of home educating their child.”Tim Nicholls, the head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said the Ofsted research showed that many parents were home schooling their children because their schools were not giving them they support they needed. “This is really alarming, particularly as schools have a legal duty to make reasonable adjustments for children on the autism spectrum. Home schooling should be a choice but for many there’s simply no other option.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “School leaders work tirelessly with young people and their parents to ensure they receive a high-quality education, and to support children who are having difficulties at school.“However, cuts both to school budgets and to wider support services make it increasingly difficult for schools to provide the high-level support that some children need, which can lead to frustration and friction between schools and families.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f07b43aae8df29225f7215d07a87c71e955cae8/0_0_2049_1230/master/2049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e40e33369e0d239c9195115db4eb9ca","title":"uk universities bme staff less likely to hold top jobs","story":"Study shows minority ethnic staff paid on average £7,000 less than white colleaguesBlack and minority ethnic (BME) academic staff at UK universities are paid less than their white counterparts and are considerably less likely to hold the most senior jobs, analysis shows.White academic staff take home an average of just over £49,000 a year, while black academic staff average just over £42,000.Prof Kalwant Bhopal, the deputy director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at Birmingham University, said: “These findings are very depressing. They are not new but should be a wake-up call for universities.“If universities are serious about inclusion, social justice and equality then surely the time has come for the race equality charter to be mandatory and directly linked to research funding – and for universities to address the perpetuation and reinforcement of white privilege that continues in higher education.”The UCU research, based on analysis of the 2017-18 Higher Education Statistics Agency staff record, confirmed that British universities continued to make slow progress in promoting black and other minority ethnic staff to senior positions and ensure pay equality.The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “These figures lift the lid on the extent of the race pay gaps in universities and the lack of representation of BME staff at the top level. It is going to take systematic change and some difficult conversations if we are going to make any headway.”The union is balloting its members on possible strike action over pay and conditions including pensions. “Universities need to work with us to address the issue and recognise that they will need to transform their practices to implement real change for BME staff,” said Grady.The lack of BME academic staff, particularly in senior roles, is seen as a major problem by many BME students. A recent report by Universities UK, the umbrella organisation representing the sector, found that while progress had been made in tackling sexual harassment on campus, far less had been done to deal with racial harassment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0450b4cfd7dada3fa993fa211e804950f709e5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a876a6493610937bdc5f8a5899df795f","title":"do you work for a fossil fuel company share your experiences","story":"If you work for a fossil fuel firm, we’d like to hear from you.

In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US’s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade.Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come.Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always “like waiting for a sneeze”.The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree.“Over the next decade we’ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,” Liebreich adds.The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore.Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too.This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world’s transport and heating systems too. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965.

The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world’s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world’s demand for crude will begin to fall.“It provides a lot of hope,” says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. “It provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.”It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world’s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says.“We’re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it’s difficult and complicated. But at the same time we now live in a world where two-thirds of the global population live in a country where wind and solar power is the cheapest form of new electricity capacity. We have the tools to do this,” he says.Chris Stark, the head of the UK’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, says the precedent set by the renewables industry proves that emerging technologies to capture carbon emissions can follow suit.The progress to date is not yet enough to meet global targets set in the Paris climate agreement, but a plateau in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 could play a major role in averting catastrophic global heating above 3C. It also proves that further ambition could bring the world closer to the sub-2C goal.“This change is a testament to new climate policies, and the work that has been done around the world. We need to do more of that,” he adds.The UK plans to lead the world’s future climate ambitions. Next year, Glasgow will host the UN’s 26th Conference of the Parties climate talks, known as COP26, to set out a roadmap that keeps rising temperatures well within 2C above pre-industrialised levels.Claire Perry MP, the president for COP26, says the climate talks are “where the rubber hits the road on the historic Paris agreement”. She adds that “expectations are rightly high” due to the “mounting public concern over climate change”, but the UK is ready to deliver on those expectations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07f397254f23b1c4c471fcfe3f98a4380547f484/0_61_1961_1177/master/1961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da2d407afaa114c7d487b4c60c6298a1","title":"euro 2020 qualifiers ronaldo giroud portugal france","story":"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 700th career goal when he converted a 72nd-minute penalty in Portugal’s Euro 2020 qualifier defeat by Ukraine.The 34-year-old has scored 95 for his country, 450 for Real Madrid, 118 for Manchester United, 32 for Juventus and five for Sporting.Portugal were beaten 2-1 in Group B, a result which meant Ukraine qualified for next summer’s finals.

In line with Uefa’s three-step protocol, England reported the abuse to the referee, Ivan Bebek, who passed on a message to be broadcast over the PA system for it to stop.In the 41st minute, following further abuse and more complaints from England, Bebek temporarily stopped the game and asked Southgate whether he wanted to take his players off to the dressing room. The manager said they wanted to make it to half-time. There were further talks during the interval but England were determined to play on in the second-half – to show the racists they would not win, to quote Clarke. There remained the threat that they would walk off if there was more abuse and the game, which finished in a 6-0 England win, would be abandoned. “I know that whatever we do might be perceived as not being enough but I think we’ve made a major statement,” Southgate said. “We’ve made a major statement with the way we played, through such difficult circumstances. I don’t think a game of this magnitude has ever been stopped twice. So, I’m incredibly proud of all of the players and all of the staff.“We could be criticised for not going far enough but I think we’ve made a huge statement and, frankly, we were in an impossible situation to get it right to the satisfaction of everybody.“The players were all absolutely adamant they wanted to keep playing but also we knew, if there was anything in the second half, we’d be reporting it and coming off.”Southgate gave an insight into how steeled his players now were to racist abuse. “Sadly, because of their experiences in our own country, they are hardened to racism,” he said.“I don’t know what that says about our society but that’s the reality. It actually saddens me. So they actually are in the dressing room smiling because they’ve played so well.“We will recognise there’s been an opportunity tonight to raise awareness of this issue and I think that has happened. But Raheem Sterling has got the hump with me for taking him off when he’s on a hat-trick. Sometimes you have to smile through adversity. We all knew we were in a pretty impossible situation so we’ve tried to navigate it in the best way we could.”Sterling later retweeted a news story in which the Bulgaria coach, Krasimir Balakov, accused England of having a bigger racism problem than his own country. “Mmmmh‚ not sure about this one chief,” Sterling wrote. “Feeling sorry for Bulgaria to be represented by such idiots in their stadium. Anyway, 6-0 and we go back home. At least we did our job. Safe travel to our fans, you guys did well.”“It didn’t affect my feelings. I think I’m quite lucky in that way because I don’t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don’t have a voice, so it didn’t hurt or harm my feelings one bit. It was obviously bigger than me and bigger than what I felt.”The Bulgaria captain, Ivelin Popov, was seen in a heated debate with a section of home supporters near to the tunnel as the teams departed for half-time. “I’ve been told what the Bulgaria captain did at half-time,” Rashford said. “To stand alone and do the right thing takes courage and acts like that shouldn’t go unnoticed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a651674ef798622d4abd39db58a6a600a2aac4f0/0_360_3818_2292/master/3818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82b4c0e5d6f482988e26f362f4d194cc","title":"six minutes added time racism england bulgaria euro 2020","story":"Welcome to the new world. We came expecting a football match. What we got was a miserable occasion on a miserable night in a miserable stadium against miserable opposition played out to a miserable backdrop of recrimination and bad blood.By the end this did not feel like a sporting event at all. It felt like an open sore, an affront to the basic idea of nations coming together to exchange flags, in a stadium transformed into a well of poison.England’s players were racially abused by sections of the home crowd throughout. There were Nazi salutes in the stands, this in a nation that embraced the fascism of the Third Reich within living memory.In the middle of which there were also strange, grisly little details. As England walked off at half-time Bulgaria’s captain, Ivelin Popov, could be seen leaning into fencing to appeal to the home fans to stop the racist chanting that threatened to curtail this sorry spectacle.As a statement threatening to abandon the match was read out over the PA a woman in the home section laughed and made mock thumbs-down gestures, as though this was all a rave, a lark, a pantomime.An hour after the final whistle, just as Greg Clarke, the chairman of the FA, had talked about, among other things, England’s backroom staff being deeply upset by events on the pitch, Bulgarian journalists could be seen laughing and joking, greeting this horror show not with shame or remorse, but as though it was, at worst, an inconvenience.The statement from Bulgaria’s manager, Krasimir Balakov, that he had not noticed anything, that he just wanted to talk about football, was an anatomy of cowardly dissembling. Balakov had a responsibility to his sport and to basic human decency. He failed on both counts.Somehow England played brilliantly in the middle of all this, a game that fell apart around them at times and against opponents who barely played at all. Who knows, perhaps this might come to seem like a righteous occasion.Racist abuse in football stadiums has been a source of unhappiness for as long as there has been racist abuse and football stadiums. There was at least some sense of action being taken in the enforcement of the under-enforced Uefa protocols at the fag end of so many inadequate fines and decisive measures never put in place. By the end, the spectacle of England playing on felt, rightly or wrongly, like a kind of resistance.A kind of history was made as for the first time football made a live intervention. The half‑time break was the third stoppage of the game. The first came just after England’s second goal. As the England end celebrated the sounds of joy and exhilaration were replaced by chants of “You racist bastards, you know what you are”. Provocative perhaps but also prescient and entirely accurate. The first monkey chants from the home crowd were heard shortly after.They were directed at Tyrone Mings, who took the ball by the touchline and was greeted by a small group of Bulgarians making the hated, hateful noises. Mings made his pass then turned and stared at the crowd. In that moment your heart broke slightly. Here was a man on his England debut, fielding with the utmost grace and composure not just vile abuse but a moment that will echo far beyond this shabby‑looking pitch.Moments later, Gareth Southgate could be seen talking to the Uefa official Danilo Filacchione, pointing over at the far side where the noise had come from. Filacchione spoke into his walkie-talkie. The game paused. And so we waited. Finally, the PA announcement came, a thin, anxious, hectoring voice that drew boos and shrieks from the home crowd.“Because of racist behaviour among spectators which is interfering with the game the referee has indicated he may have to suspend the match.“Please be under no mistake the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if the racist behaviour continues.”We crawled on, horribly. At 40 minutes there was more of the same as Mings took the ball. A three-way discussion followed between manager, referee and Filacchione. There were whistles, jeers, objects thrown from the ultras in black at the far end close to the Bulgaria goal.England shuffled together protectively. Finally, they walked back out to restart when they might have chosen to walk off, a decision that drew boos and whistles from the home crowd. Six minutes of stoppage time for racism, the board flashed up.There was time for more abuse and time also for another goal as Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane (playing a wonderful hand as a creator in the middle of all this poison) set up Raheem Sterling for 4-0.The second half felt like a wake, and not just for the idea of the game as a competitive exercise, as England scored six and might have had 10.Bulgaria had played like a rabble. Their fans had disgraced their country and deeply embarrassed (it is to be hoped) their president, Boris Mikhailov. Presumably his apologies will be just as heartfelt as his complaints on Friday that Tammy Abraham had been wide of the mark in assuming all this would indeed come to pass in Bulgaria’s national stadium.Will England ever want to come here again? Before kick-off their fans had filled their corner-slice of this sallow concrete bowl with the usual travelling pageantry of St George’s flags. The rest of the stadium was a half-empty husk. No great hardship shutting parts of this ground: the end opposite the banned area remained a sea of empty seats.There will be a reckoning for the Bulgarian Football Association. Perhaps the protocols will now be used more often. What is a protocol anyway? A mode of behaviour, an attempt to civilise. What protocol did we see here? It isn’t enough. For now, no other European nation should be asked to play in Sofia. Lock the gates. Let the plastic seating moulder, the concrete crack.Yet, beyond this, the idea Uefa can realistically staunch this kind of performative racist protest is laughable. These Bulgarians were not having a moment or allowing their usual high standards to slip. They were gleefully taking the opportunity to abuse black footballers and to demonstrate in some cases that they are fascists.One thing is certain: the England team can be hugely proud of their grace under pressure. There was something majestic about those red shirts, still abused periodically but determined to see this through. Football carried on. But this cannot be allowed to pass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc3a97eab6b49366d2a28c26485d977db2efd73c/0_263_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722108d79cade4d743ed37a2dc2cb1b3","title":"how we met her note was either going to say youve got no chance or be her phone number","story":"Helen and Steve Errington Dormer, 56 and 43, met in 2006 when they were both working in the same prisonIt’s not the usual setting for a love story, but a chance meeting at HM Prison The Mount in Hertfordshire sparked romance for Helen and Steve. “It was 2006 and I was working as a teacher there,” says Helen. Steve, who was a prison officer, had recently moved to the education department to expand his career. “Back then nobody wanted to work in that area but I was keen to spend more time doing one-on-one work with prisoners. I was ready for something new.” They met for the first time while Helen was teaching a class in the prison’s library. “And I always joke that he is long overdue to go back,” says Helen. Although they both liked each other, Steve was reluctant to make the first move. “I was a prison officer and she was a civilian, so I was worried it would have looked inappropriate.”In September that year, Helen left the prison to start a new teaching job. On her last day, she wrote a note to Steve and originally gave it to a colleague to pass on. In the end she plucked up the courage to give him the letter directly, to let him know she was interested. “I had an idea what it might be. It was either going to be her phone number or a note to say get lost, you’ve got no chance,” he says. The pair began dating the following month, pursuing their shared interests of art, opera and musicals. When they met, they had a few concerns about the 13-year age gap, although Helen says it has become much less significant over time. “Steve was 29 when we started going out, and a few people raised eyebrows. It wasn’t a big deal for us though. Age is just a number.”While Steve admired Helen’s intelligence and education, she was drawn in by his fun nature. “I thought he had such a serious look about him, but underneath there is a very silly side. He just couldn’t show it at work.” At the time Helen was working as a teacher and a singer.They married in July 2008 during a silent Quaker meeting. “The vows, or promises as we call them, are spoken but the rest of the meeting takes place in silence,” explains Helen. “Rather than having an officiant, we marry ourselves in front of witnesses at the meeting. Some people can then stand up afterwards and speak with messages for you.” After the meeting the couple celebrated with a reception for friends and family.Not long after they were married, Helen’s father became unwell. “Between 2008 and 2016 we lost three of our parents which was really hard,” she says. They battled through bereavement together – Helen’s parents and Steve’s dad died in that time frame – and it brought them closer. Since then they have developed a passion for travel and visited many countries. “We have been all over the world, to Africa, Nepal, India, China, Australia and Brazil. I love that Steve is always up for anything and always enthusiastic. We do crazy things and change our plans at the last minute just because we can,” says Helen. That “can do” attitude is also something Steve loves about his wife. “I remember once we went white-water rafting after a difficult six-hour trek. Helen was absolutely terrified, but she still got in the boat and did it. She never gives up. It’s one of the things I most admire about her,” he says.The couple attribute the success of their relationship to a close friendship and a taste for new adventures. “I was an opera singer until I was 37, then a teacher and now I do some writing and composing. We are always reinventing ourselves and trying new things,” says Helen. “It’s so important to be able to do things together,” says Steve. “I think chemistry is superficial. When you really love someone you choose to invest that time in them.”While the pair admit they have taken an unconventional path compared with other couples, they believe it has helped them to build a stronger bond. “We are never stagnant and we never say still,” says Helen. “We have shared dreams and goals and I think that is really important for keeping a relationship alive.”Want to share your story?

Of course you have. But with help you can move on …How many grudges do you have at work? The workplace grudge can spring with equal force from small and large hurts. These may range – allow me to try to imagine – from the seemingly accidental negligence of the person who changed the toaster setting in the canteen so that your breakfast bagel burned, to the larger disappointment of being overlooked for a job. In my – former – workplaces, I visualised grudges as small red flags fluttering above the heads of certain colleagues. This can’t be healthy. So why are grudges so powerful, and what is the best way to manage them?As a former professional cricketer who had to compete for selection, Sylvester has first-hand experience of grudges. He was also unfairly overlooked for a job once – although this was a validated grudge because one member of the interview panel thought Sylvester had been wronged, and phoned him later to apologise. The key, he says, is “to hold the mirror” to your grudge. “What does it really say about you?”Sylvester’s job is “massaging out the pain of the grudge” in workplaces. “That’s what I do every day.” For those who can’t get themselves to a grudge spa (or to talking therapy), Sylvester advises asking three questions. First, what emotions are being evoked by the person you hold a grudge against? Second, what does that say about you? “We inherently want to avoid the truth about ourselves,” he says. This is the time to accept that you could have stepped in to readjust the toaster setting if you were less passive in social situations, or told you could have prepared more effectively for the job interview. The third step is “self-correction”, such as: “I’m going to cheerfully guard the toaster each morning until my bagel is cooked,” or: “I’m going to look at a number of opportunities in the company to upskill myself.”Renshaw thinks that role-playing the begrudged person, or writing out their supposed thoughts, is more helpful than merely thinking about them. Our heads are not always the best places to do this. “There’s too much jumping around. It’s more exacting to write down the thoughts or say them aloud. They become more real when you hear yourself.” Mind you, Renshaw says he has never had a work grudge, being “one of those annoyingly glass-half-full guys”.A grudge can be dissipated by following Renshaw’s or Sylvester’s advice – or it can be transmuted, as in the case of the crime-fiction writer Sophie Hannah, who has written a nonfiction book called How to Hold a Grudge. A grudge, she says, is simply “an instructive story that we choose to learn from, not a lasting feeling of resentment. This enables us to honour our most significant emotional and psychological experiences and commit to our highest values.”In any case, isn’t there a pleasure to be had from a well-nourished grudge? Sylvester describes lighter grudges as something “to be picked up and put down like a newspaper”, almost like a leisure activity. The author Joanna Cannon wrote on Twitter that she feeds and waters her grudges “as if they were small exotic plants”. And William Blake’s poem A Poison Tree is perhaps the seminal work of grudge literature. Surely it’s OK to reserve a small, manageable dose of dislike for someone? Emma Donaldson-Feilder, an occupational psychologist, doesn’t think so. “Actually, I think that’s really unhealthy for most people. I would define a grudge as holding on to something beyond the point that it’s useful … It’s a stone in your shoe,” she says.If you have used the original hurt to motivate you, but the hurt still remains, “it may be helpful to let go” says Donaldson-Feilder. This feels vaguely disappointing. It doesn’t seem so very wrong to keep the motivation and the grudge. “Mmm,” she murmurs sympathetically. “But having negative feelings towards someone is always going to be a bit destabilising. It comes down to compassion, and being kind to ourselves and valuing ourselves.”At least after this I should have a clear run at the toaster tomorrow.

But he ended up rerecording it as a duet’Ian and Andy did the horns on Coldcut’s first album, and I sang a song with them called My Telephone. After hours we all went back in to the studio to see if we could come up with anything together, and the result was People Hold On, a massive hit. Because everyone said it would look clumsy with two bands’ names on, it was released as “Coldcut featuring Lisa Stansfield”. When we went back to our own music, they said, “Well everyone knows you as Lisa Stansfield now” and that was the end of Blue Zone. But I wanted my mates with me, even though it was my name on the record. That triangle of people was very strong.All Around the World was something we wrote together. I came into the studio, and Ian was messing around at the piano. He had a melody, and I just started singing: “Been around the world and I, I, I…” Everyone laughed but Ian said, “Wait, it’s really good, that.” It just came into my head – it was nonsense, but had a really good feel to it. “I, I, I” became the main hook. We’d no idea how massive it would become.I was the first white British woman to reach No 1 on the R\u0026ampB chart – the American black music chart. I remember sitting in a hotel room reading all the different charts around the world and just going: “Fucking hell!” All Around the World was top of most. Over the years, a lot of people have told me the song helped them through a difficult period. That’s beautiful, to know you’ve helped someone in that way. The song literally took us around the world, four times. I suppose you have to be careful what you sing, because you might have to do it.Blue Zone was signed to an indie label, then Arista bought the label, so we ended up on a major by accident. We made a mainstream pop record and they needed a B-side, so we knocked out this song called Big Thing in an eight-track studio behind Lisa’s mum and dad’s house. It was more soul than pop, and got more attention than the rest of the record. The label asked if we had any other songs like that, so we played them All Around the World.The song came together really quickly. Once Lisa had all the lyrics down and I’d done a basic track with Andy, the whole vocal was two takes: one lead vocal and one take for single harmony. She just went in and sang it. The vocals from that original eight-track recording are what’s on the global hit. We put real strings on it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, but otherwise it was all low-budget and DIY. It’s hilarious, really.The lyrics – about searching the world for an estranged lover – aren’t from personal experience. Lisa tends to make up stories and she’s good at putting herself in someone else’s shoes. If you write down “been around the world and I, I, I, I can’t find my baby” it sounds nonsensical, but there’s obviously something that connects emotionally. It leapt out to other people far more than it did to us. For us, it was one song in a group of five that we thought were good. But as soon as our manager, Jazz Summers, heard it, he went: “That’s it!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93be58ff31a411a9c957f5205d763b0d8f50a184/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2355393649723ffebb69969bf83ccd","title":"tricky interview","story":"The pioneering musician was raised among gangsters and has battled with anxiety, as documented in his new memoir. But nothing could prepare him for the grief of losing his daughter this yearUntil recently, Tricky had a picture of his mother as the screensaver on his phone. He never got to know her properly – she killed herself when he was just four years old – but he had gone through life believing that she was out there, somewhere, keeping an eye on him.“And I did believe that,” he says. “Until 8 May this year. Because that was the day my world ended. So if she was supposed to be looking after me, what the fuck’s happened?”The date he is referring to is the day his daughter Mazy – also known as Mina – died at the age of 24 (there is currently an ongoing NHS trust inquiry into the cause). At the time of her death, Tricky put out a brief statement saying: “I thought I knew what loss was, but now my daughter is gone I realise I had no idea what it was after all.”Today, several months on, he still sounds utterly bereft: “I’ve lost my belief,” he says at one point. “Hopefully I will get it back.”He is here to talk about his autobiography, and you wouldn’t, on the surface, know that he was grieving. We are sitting at an outdoor bar alongside Regent’s canal in north London. Tricky is drinking “water with bubbles” and smoking rollups. He is outgoing, cheeky and full of warmth. He speaks with a thick Bristolian burr, loudly and quickly, a surprise to people who have heard his music – which can be dark and claustrophobic – and expect a moody personality to match.The memoir charts Tricky’s unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music’s most creative visionaries. His hushed style of rapping, unusual production methods and ability to reconstruct soul, punk, reggae and hip-hop into strange new shapes has long left critics scrabbling for words to define his 13-album career. He hates being called “the godfather of trip-hop” – hates the phrase “trip-hop”, in fact – but it is probably as close as you will get to a neat label and it is hard to argue with.Tricky shaped the sound of Massive Attack’s landmark 1991 album Blue Lines, and four years later – thanks in part to the beguiling vocals of his then partner and the mother of Mazy, Martina Topley-Bird – changed the face of pop with his baffling, beautiful debut solo album, Maxinquaye, named after his mother.The book’s title – Hell Is Round the Corner – is taken from a track on Maxinquaye, and it aptly describes a life in which violence and tragedy have lurked beside every success story. Born Adrian Thaws and raised in Bristol by his grandmother and aunties, Tricky had a happy, but unconventional, childhood: food often consisted of rabbit stew sourced from the family’s poaching expeditions criminality was an accepted way of life.Without his musical gift, Tricky’s prospects would not have looked bright: “Where I come from, a lot of people are either on drugs, in prison or dead,” he says. His uncles were gangsters and Tricky grew up noticing how people would treat him differently whenever their names were dropped: his food in a curry house would be upgraded the atmosphere in a pub might suddenly change.“Once, I asked my auntie why everyone was scared of my uncle Martin,” he says. “She said: ‘Because if he says he’s going to cut your throat, he’ll cut your throat.’”He saw unimaginable violence from a young age. Several social workers, including his other daughter, Marie, have read his book, and told him that the way he was brought up would, in their professional eyes, count as neglect.But that is not how he sees it. He loved life in Bristol’s Knowle West, a tough, predominantly white neighbourhood, and says his upbringing was full of affection. Still, you can see where the social workers are coming from. His grandmother would often say things like: “‘Oh, it’s cold today, you don’t wanna go school, stay at home with me.’”She would also tell him to always empty his pockets before going out, in case he accidentally left something behind at a crime scene. “What I consider normal ain’t really normal,” he concedes.Perhaps the most startling example of this in the book is when he introduces a character from his youth as a “lovely guy” and then, a paragraph or so later, breezily mentions that said character had also shot someone in the neck. Tricky pauses when I mention this, as if trying to work out who I’m on about. Then he breaks out in an explosion of affection: “Oh, Wayney Lomas! Yeah! Aw, Wayney was a brilliant guy! But yeah, he got found with his head chopped off. They shot him in the head, in his house, then took his body, chopped him up and put him in a concrete floor.”Er … who did?“They don’t know who did it. But he was a lovely, lovely guy. But yeah, he’d shot someone in the neck, apparently.”He checks my startled reaction to this tale and laughs. Is it any wonder, he says, that his music can sound dark to some people? Darkness is what he has always known. His first memory is peeking into his mum’s coffin while it was resting in the family home before burial. Didn’t that mess with his head a bit? “I don’t think it would be a great thing, would it?”The men in his life were tough guys, but the women who raised him were tougher. He saw his grandmother and aunties street-fight like his uncles (“The fighting was more vicious, cos men care more about their ego”) and observed them being strong in other ways, too: running the household and feeding the family while the men were away doing time.“I’ve a kinship with women,” he says. “That’s why I’ve always put women in strong positions in music.”Topley-Bird was the most important of these. He met her by sheer luck in about 1992 – she had been singing with schoolfriends outside his house. A few years later, they became a couple and had Mazy together the relationship didn’t last, but they continued to collaborate musically on several more albums.That music as restless and ruthlessly experimental as Tricky’s found commercial success is perhaps surprising, not least to him. He expected to be an underground producer – instead Maxinquaye went to No 3, and was followed by a string of Top 40 albums. His sound became hugely influential and he was sought after by everyone from David Bowie to U2. Everyone wanted to be associated with him – even Samantha Cameron claimed to have spent time hanging out with him while she was at university in Bristol (Tricky has always remained sceptical of this, saying he has no recollection of her).But he didn’t enjoy being in the limelight. A tempestuous relationship with Björk turned him into a tabloid fixture for a while, and he increasingly tried to self-sabotage his career. One time, in New York, he failed to turn up to a meeting in his hotel with Madonna because he wanted to sleep instead. He was also terrible when it came to money. He knows that he once owned a house in New Jersey with acres of land around it, but he can’t remember where exactly it was, how it got sold or where the cash went.His mental state wasn’t helped by the amount of weed he was smoking, while he believes candida – a yeast infection rarely taken seriously by conventional doctors – was largely responsible for some of his more erratic behaviour. Even without these problems, the spotlight of fame didn’t suit him. His subdued rapping style comes, he says, from shyness the same goes for his live shows, which use minimal stage lighting: “It’s all lack of confidenceThis proved to be an issue in 2011, when Tricky was invited by Beyoncé to appear as a guest vocalist for her headline set at Glastonbury. He says he wanted to say no, but his manager insisted, so he wrote a verse to perform during her song Baby Boy. When he got on stage and saw the lights, huge crowd and celebrity faces – Chris Martin, Jay Z – staring back at him, he froze. “I wasn’t ready for it … it was too much,” he says. “I told the press that my mic wasn’t working, but it was working fine.”Anxiety has sometimes overcome him in more destructive ways. In his book, he talks about living in Los Angeles in the 00s, when he would keep an Uzisubmachine gun underneath his bed for protection. Would he have been prepared to use it?“This ain’t bad-guy talk, cos I’m not a bad guy,” he says. “But people don’t realise what fear can do. I’ve had situations where I’ve been so scared, where I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, and it’s gone on for weeks and it’s ruining my life. It makes you sick, it makes you mentally ill.”He continues: “So I had this person – I can’t tell you who – on my mind day and night. And there was a chance I could bump into them. My mate brought me over some gloves, a different gun, and I had to polish the bullets so you don’t leave your finger prints on them. And then I went out in the car, to see if we were going to bump into each other.”He notices my eyes widening – not for the first time today. “Fear can be very dangerous. You should never make someone too scared of you.”Processing emotions has never been easy for Tricky. He admits he was a terrible, absent boyfriend to Björk. She apparently told him he was “emotionally numb”. And it is true that, throughout the book, there is a sense of indifference to some of the people and situations in his life.But it is striking how Tricky shakes off that detachment whenever he writes about Mazy. When talking about her, he is anything but emotionally numb: he recounts with love taking her on Australian tours (where she was babysat by Perry Farrell of Jane’s Addiction, of all people), and buying that house in the New Jersey wilderness so she could play safely away from the New York streets. His adoration for her is so clear and, now, so heartbreaking.“One of the biggest problems with my daughter is that I’ve never loved anybody that much before,” he says. “I was there at her birth. And all of a sudden I started feeling things. And it was too much for me. Because I was emotionally numb, and it was easier for me to get through life being emotionally numb, but then suddenly I was feeling things.”He tries to explain how he’s feeling now. “I’ve lost people before, like grandmothers, but I’ve bounced back,” he says. “This is different. Everything looks different, even music doesn’t sound the same. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I was in Islington yesterday and I was hoping I was going to see her, hoping she’s gonna walk up to me.”I ask how he is coping, and he says therapy. “It’s good. Like, really good.” But getting through each day is tough. He says there is a girl in his apartment building in Berlin, where he lives, who is the spitting image of Mazy. When she was alive, he even connected the pair of them on FaceTime, just to freak them both out. “And now, when I see her, it’s like: ‘Whoa!’”Mazy was a musician herself, and Tricky has plans to work on some of the songs she left behind. He already has two tracks that he wants to put on his next album. There are other things, too, that give him hope. Like the time a “white ghetto dude” stopped him in Notting Hill and said: “Your music got me through prison.” Or the moment a young Texan revealed that his family had played Tricky’s music to him while he was in a coma. Then there’s the nurse in a Chicago burns unit who told his drummer they played his music to the kids there. “That’s when I knew: ‘This ain’t just about me,’” he says.He has been thinking of these stories a lot recently. About how others have found something in his music that has got them through.“I never thought of my music as dark,” he says before we part. “It can’t be that dark to get people through a dark period, can it?”He gives me a huge embrace before he leaves, an acknowledgement that it has been a difficult conversation for him. He is going through unimaginable darkness right now, but hopefully he, too, can find some light.Hell Is Round the Corner is published by Blink on 31 October. Tricky will be in conversation at the Royal Festival Hall, South Bank Centre, London, on 26 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b06f6357c0e3e2a47aa62627755037d1475e00/0_0_3329_1997/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9b01c15da153d58dfcfc9ba780e909","title":"what is the truth about vaping","story":"Jamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping.

The main one called for “annual limits on the amount a single permissible donor may contribute to a political party or a candidate, in order to prevent undue influence of large contributors”.The Conservative party chair, James Cleverly, accused Corbyn of “sowing the seeds of ision”, adding: “If anything, tougher checks against electoral fraud will protect the democratic rights of all communities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78724db2b5f48b8017bbaba7effffc44bfc499f/0_646_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35239ce22c1c4ac19800ef72c65b8a1e","title":"lib dem apologises dawn butler lied accounts racism westminster","story":"Steve Wilson had criticised Labour MP after she recounted racist incidents at WestminsterA Liberal Democrat staffer has been forced to apologise after he claimed that Labour’s Dawn Butler invented her experience of racial discrimination in parliament.The shadow equalities minister wrote to the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, asking for the suspension of Steve Wilson. He had criticised Butler on Twitter by saying her account of being confused for a cleaner in a lift in parliament because she was black was was “just not true” and she should stop “propagating” such “stories”.Wilson is an office manager for his wife, the former Labour MP Angela Smith, who was briefly part of the Change UK grouping and drew controversy shortly after its foundation by saying people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds had a “funny tinge” during an appearance on the BBC Two programme Politics Live. She subsequently said she had misspoken and apologised.Butler told the : “White men denying our lived experiences and accusing those of us who speak out about them of lying legitimises and promotes racism. This isn’t a ‘story’. This is race discrimination in the workplace it is experienced by black, Asian and ethnic minority people in workplaces across our country every single day and we need to stamp it out.”Butler wrote about her experience of being a black woman in politics when she first entered parliament in an opinion piece for the  as part of Black History Month.She wrote: “I was naive when I first entered parliament I thought everyone believed in equality and all would be treated with respect. I still remember the shock when I got in a lift and was told that ‘this lift isn’t for cleaners’. It stunned me. Such blatant racism from elected members of parliament stopped me in my tracks. But being one of only two black women elected to parliament and with so many privileged white men in one place, when I look back it shouldn’t have been surprising.”Wilson made his apology after being contacted by the .Smith defected to the Lib Dems in September after quitting Labour to form Change UK. The outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn has represented Penistone and Stocksbridge since 2010 and has been in parliament since 2005.She has announced she will run in Altrincham and Sale West at the next election, challenging the chair of the Tory 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, and Wilson has been actively campaigning for her.Butler, who is one of Corbyn’s closest allies, said Smith’s husband needed to be immediately investigated by the Lib Dems.She said: “I urge Jo Swinson to investigate … and take firm disciplinary action against this disgraceful gaslighting behaviour.”A Labour source said: “The Lib Dems should immediately suspend him and fully investigate.”Butler has reported the incident to House of Commons authorities to ask for them to investigate, as well as to Swinson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2254d56c9f50ad7011e0dbc6a7000bef881f3398/0_328_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4d073b672381c4a37cb38f8a5dedb77","title":"makes monty python look like panorama readers on the queens speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to the Queen’s speech and the state opening of parliamentThis is all pointless isn’t it?

This makes Monty Python look like Panorama! Barry BennettThis certainly is weird – a party that does not have a majority, whose leader has not won an election, at a point where there is very likely going to be another constitutional, and there’s a Queen’s Speech, as if nothing unusual was going on? The Tories are seriously taking the p*ss out of the monarchy. They are using her. There’s no other way of describing it. Using the Queen as a tool for their propaganda. I hope she does something to upset their arrogance and complacency, like wearing an EU badge or blue and yellow shoes. Cyclist30mphYou know you are desperate when you feel sorry for the Queen being forced to slide around in Johnson’s bullshit with Cummings lurking in the gloom. Why is there no shame at all?

These people should think about the little children looking at their behaviour and saying “cor” to each other. My Race Is HumanOnce again the monarchy is allowing itself to be a political tool of Boris Johnson. This is becoming something of a habit. Much like the unlawful prorogation, on the surface it’s not that odd to have a Queen’s Speech. It is rather odd to have one right before a general election that the Tories have been campaigning for over the past month. They’re getting the Queen to announce a Tory manifesto. pretentiouspenguinThe Queen says the government is committed to the environment.

It was enough to torpedo her finances and before long the heating was off, vegetables were dropped from meals and the house grew filthy because she could not afford cleaning products.“It is designed to make it difficult so that they can get as many people off it as they can,” she said.Mark Abraham, a married father of twins in south London, was denied a month’s benefits because an automated system linking salary data from HMRC with the Department for Work and Pensions misreported his previous income from a TV production job. He showed wage slips that proved the pay was reported wrong, but jobcentre staff could do nothing. Food ran low, he broke down mentally and ended up homeless and estranged from his family.“The DWP staff appeared to be in thrall to the UC computer, allowing it to make all the decisions,” he said. “Being able to tackle the computer beast that had made this decision wasn’t within their capability.”Mary Blyde, a 61-year-old with incontinence and learning disability, was discovered by a charity worker lying in her unheated home in Gateshead on a urine-soaked sofa after her benefit was cut. She had missed a note on her online account warning her she needed to take action. When a charity worker found her, all that was left in her cupboard were three potatoes, a can of meat and a carton of orange juice.“Sometimes I get scared the money won’t come into my bank,” she said.These are some of the lives that campaigners warn risk being forgotten as the government and its technology industry partners pour millions into automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning in the benefits system.The strategy might seem inevitable, welcome even, given its spread to other walks of life. How we use transport, watch TV and use email are all increasingly shaped by AI. Many UC claimants welcome the ability to communicate digitally rather than waiting on hold on the phone. Ministers argue digitisation will make claiming benefits more straightforward, reduce fraud and save money.The DWP’s last annual report claimed investment in digital technology “improved the experiences of people who rely on our services, making us more effective and efficient, and enabling us to personalise delivery for customers and claimants”.The ministry tries to create an atmosphere that will attract programmers to develop technologies for a welfare system that is used by 20 million people. There is an “innovation dojo” to investigate new technologies, and its “intelligent automation garage” – an echo of Google’s Digital Garage training centres which began in sunny California – is looking for ways to leverage the “DWP data lake” for “improved citizen outcomes”, albeit based in a grey government building in north Newcastle.But many see the reforms as erecting digital walls around the welfare state which are now only scalable by the computer literate. A further digital transformation with robotic automation and machine learning will only make things worse, they fear.She recalled a released prisoner who dropped in recently for help signing on for UC, could not cope with the system and said he wanted to go back inside. “He kicked off, the police came and he was arrested,” she said.Charities are trying to help. Blyde, for example, relies on Gary Fawcett at the Your Voice Counts in Gateshead. He has spent 155 hours on her case, remarking: “It almost broke our project.”A recent exchange on her online journal was telling. She had already lost almost £1,000 in benefits because she did not know she needed to input more data, so he asked the DWP to tell her about future problems by post.“Mary CANNOT read or access her journal in any way,” he wrote on her journal. “I can no longer be sorting this out for her.”The reply came: “We do not communicate by letter … this is an online service.”Fawcett said again she could not access, read or input into the journal. He asked: “Who is supposed to do this?”The DWP replied simply that the online system needed updating, signing off: “Please do this ASAP.”Fawcett is also trying to help Julian Jennings, 65, who cannot read or write, has learning disabilities and does not even know he is on UC.“I have never used a computer in my life,” he said as he sat at Fawcett’s desk with his UC account screen open. “I used to go to the dole. It was much easier. You talked about it and signed it. If there were any problems they used to sort it.”There is a message from a UC official: “Hello Julian. Please read the attached letter.”“I can’t read none of that,” he said, peering at the screen. “How are you supposed to get your money?”Blyde and Jennings are among 1.5 million people in the UK with learning disabilities and are not alone in struggling with the system. Tears filled the eyes of Danny Brice, 47, in London when he showed the  how difficult he has found negotiating the UC programme with learning disabilities and dyslexia.“I call it the black hole,” he said. “I feel shaky. I get stressed about it. This is the worst system in my lifetime. They assess you as a number not a person. Talking is the way forward, not a bloody computer. I feel like the computer is controlling me instead of a person. It’s terrifying.”Nine million people in the UK are functionally illiterate and 5 million adults have either never used the internet or last used it more than three months ago.And yet many of these people rely on a “digital by default” welfare system.The DWP said that humans remain available to help: “We continue to invest in frontline colleagues, from phone lines to work coaches to front of house staff,” said a spokesperson. “This means people who struggle with digital services, or are worried about a wrong decision, can get the help they need. And because we know that, for whatever reason, some people don’t want to come into a jobcentre, we are funding Citizens Advice to help support people with their claims.”Nathalie Nasor, a crisis case worker at Oasis Community Housing in Gateshead, has been helping Gary Warburton, 56, a former industrial cleaner who has been on UC since 2017. They have struggled with mysterious cuts to his benefits which seem to be the result of the system combining different databases.He recently lost sums which turned out to be repayments for a crisis loan which dated back to 1997, an overpayment of tax credit five years ago, magistrates court fines and council tax arrears.“It drives you absolutely cuckoo,” he said. “These are things from 1998. They control you and don’t give a hoot what happens to you.”“His anxiety and mood went to an all-time low,” said Nasor.The digital system has been very good for fraudsters. Staff have already made 42,000 referrals for fraud, the government has said. Kasim Mahmood, 32, a supermarket worker with Asperger’s in Manchester, was one victim.In July he was approached on Snapchat by someone offering him extra cash. As asked, he provided his address, national insurance number and driving licence, and £1,525.44 landed in his account. The fraudster had applied for a UC advance payment – essentially a loan – and it had arrived fast. He threatened Kasim with violence if he did not send half. So now Mahmood was in debt and his existing benefits were stopped because the DWP computer thought he was receiving universal credit.“I would struggle to get any benefit, yet there are people out there who get it at the click of a finger as long as they know their way around the digital system,” said his mother, Rucksana Mahmood. “There are some things we have to move forward digitally and others keep in the old fashioned way.”Last year the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, warned that the postwar British welfare state was disappearing “behind a webpage and an algorithm” and that the impact on the human rights of the most vulnerable would be “immense”. The then chancellor Philip Hammond said his report was “nonsense”. Later this week Alston will deliver a separate report on the global rise of digital welfare to the UN general assembly in New York."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/573942008b54b7e0fe9541682bbf726b3e021d0c/0_98_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d0a0a2557973a18097ea259c8c4613","title":"gregor townsend scotland rugby world cup","story":"Scotland coach refuses to make excuses for early implosion in Japan – but has he done enough to keep the job?Scotland lost well. In the first minutes after this painful defeat, Gregor Townsend and his players spoke frankly about how they had fallen short against a better team. Whatever they lack, it is not honesty about what has gone wrong. What the Scottish Rugby Union, and Scotland’s fans, will have to decide is whether Townsend is being equally realistic about whether he can put it right.“I believe we have the makings of a very good team that can compete with the best in the world,” Townsend said on Sunday. “We are running to keep up with these teams but I believe in this group of players.”Townsend is not going to quit. He says he has “the best job in the world” and, besides, he is someone who sticks to a contract. So whether he stays on or not, he says, “would not be my decision”. Here is the ledger: in the two and a half years since Townsend took charge, Scotland have won 17 of 31. There have been moments when they proved they can compete with the best teams, beating Australia in Sydney, and England at Murrayfield, and honourable defeats to South Africa and New Zealand. But there have been some rank losses, too, to Ireland and Wales, Fiji and USA.It is beginning to feel like Townsend’s team take after the way he used play when he was starting out wickedly entertaining and wildly inconsistent. Here in Japan they put away Samoa 34-0 in Kobe and thrashed an exhausted Russia 61-0 in Shizuoka. So they turned up for the games they played against teams ranked beneath them. But either side of those, they were blown away in the two first halves they played against the ones ranked above. They lost 27-3 against Ireland, after being 19-3 down at half-time, and 28-21 against Japan.Townsend has never really been able to explain what went wrong against Ireland in those first 40 minutes, although he keeps being asked about it. But whatever the problem was, he insisted that it was not the same one that cost them against Japan. “We were not right in the first 10‑15 minutes of the Ireland game, and it cost us the game then and that was a huge regret,” he said on Sunday. “Tonight we came in up for the occasion and we put real pressure on Japan in the first 10 or 15 minutes. But after that we just gave them too much ball.”There were excuses available but Townsend did not want to use them. The scheduling gave Japan every advantage, because it gave them a week off between every game, while Scotland had to play their last two matches in the space of five days. “I don’t want this to be the narrative and it’s not why we lost,” he said. “But of course it’s a handicap.”Even though most of the players who started against Russia did not start against Japan, he said: “It changes your training plan quite severely when you’ve only got one training session going into the biggest game in your pool.” But then he said: “We’ve always known this would be the case.”Townsend’s suggestion was that World Rugby either “make the tournament last longer so we have no turnarounds or make sure everyone has one” and that “they look at bigger squads, because 31 is very tight. If we’d picked up a head knock or two in our game on Wednesday we might not have had a squad.”He got good use out of his. It was telling how much better the team became in both the matches they lost after Townsend started to make changes. It almost feels like Scotland got caught in transition between two teams here, the older one who started the competition and the younger one who finished it. For a stretch of the second half in Yokohama, half the team were 24 or younger. There was Magnus Bradbury and Jamie Ritchie in the back row, Darcy Graham on one wing and Blair Kinghorn the other, Scott Cummings at lock, Zander Fagerson at prop, and George Horne at scrum-half.Throw in Adam Hastings, who played so well against Russia, and there is plenty of talent. “That was one positive tonight with the guys who came on,” Townsend said. “They were young players who came on in tough circumstances.”If he gets the chance, he is planning to build them into a team around Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell – both 27 – and Jonny Gray, who is 25. “These young players have shown that they’re deserving, they’ve stepped up and grabbed their opportunity these last few weeks,” he said. “They have to drive the team forward, coaches will be there but the players are the ones that have to set standards and step up.”The question is whether he has done enough to prove he is the man who should guide them through it. “There’s highs and lows,” Townsend said, “but I know I’ll be a better coach for it.”You sense he has a lot more to give yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abefa248f22a05c8ecdfb17a31a82f4c61dbeef6/0_295_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=524053ec4fa1959327ded4f6e72dd7eb","title":"japan new zealand showcase weekend rugby world cup","story":"Hosts and World Cup favourites eye semi-final spots while England and Wales also have their tails up for the quarter-finalsFor many years one of the staples of family entertainment on television was the art of plate spinning. The most impressive example, according to the Guinness Book of Records was in Bangkok in 1996 when David Spathaky had 108 plates spinning simultaneously. In rugby union the equivalent is a weekend of World Cup quarter-finals, with 184 players all frantically looking to keep their childhood dreams intact.Every four years it is the same: one false move and everything comes crashing down. Knockout footy, to coin a phrase set to reverberate across Japan this week, is different for precisely that reason. Keep calm and carry on rucking? Aside from keeping the referee onside, executing basic skills precisely, coping with the screeching external pressure, outwitting your opponent tactically and silencing the doubting chimp on your shoulder, there is nothing to it.It is harder still when the tackle height margins are so desperately fine and fitness levels have increased across the board. Which is why Saturday and Sunday could just be rugby’s greatest showcase. If you had to pick four top games with which to entice a non-rugby audience you would opt for the looming quartet. Japan’s stunning pool wins will take some eclipsing but what if those are just the start?Do not assume the bookmakers’ favourites – England, New Zealand, South Africa and Wales – will all inevitably cruise into the semi-finals. Remember 2007, when the All Blacks lost to France, while England, even to their own slight surprise, flattened a confident Australia? What about Ireland’s galloping Gordon Hamilton almost ambushing the Wallabies in 1991? There is no such thing as a racing certainty at this juncture.The continuing adventures of Japan, suddenly everyone’s favourite team, are the perfect case study. On Sunday they will be back in the ring with the giants of South Africa in a big-budget sequel to their famous 2015 pool match in Brighton. It says everything about the impact made by Jamie Joseph’s side that the rematch is the weekend’s hottest ticket, with Scotland’s coach, Gregor Townsend, among those convinced it will be no walkover.South Africa may be strong, unyielding and deliberate but, as New Zealand showed on the opening weekend, nor are they immune to teams who play at pace, offload brilliantly and show no fear with and without the ball. Call it bullet-train rugby: blink and they are gone. And even before a ball is kicked, Japan have the most inspirational captain at this World Cup. If Superman played rugby he would perform like Michael Leitch any team in the world would want the all-action flanker on their side. To watch him and his colleagues jog off the field in unison, outstretched hands on each other’s shoulders, is to understand just how deep Japan’s team spirit now runs.Then there is Ireland against New Zealand, a career-defining moment for two of the modern era’s most successful gurus. For either Joe Schmidt or Steve Hansen, who will both be departing their roles after this tournament, the exit door is about to open rather sooner than their respective screenwriters would like.“I’m not worrying about my All Black career … I’m more concerned we earn the right to come back on Monday,” Hansen said, fully aware sides who get ahead of themselves go home earlier than expected. “A lot of people are getting caught up in the past. It’s about what is happening on Saturday that is going to matter.”Maybe but both sides know exactly what happened last time the teams met in Dublin 11 months ago.Ireland showed signs of belated life against Samoa and will be cussed at the very least. Shutting New Zealand down at source is hard but they have managed it before. And who would dare underestimate the desire of Rory Best and his forwards when backed into a corner? “They are a quality side, they’ve been number one this year and our last three results against them are loss, win, loss so there won’t be any complacency,” Hansen said.“You have the feeling something is happening in this group,” the scrum-half Baptiste Serin said. “We don’t want to be in the quarter-finals just for the sake of it. We want to find a way of getting to the semis.”And lastly, for richer or poorer, there is England and their old friends Australia. Their respective coaches, Eddie Jones and Michael Cheika, can virtually finish each others’ sentences in weeks such as this one. “Looking backwards is only going to give you a sore neck,” said Cheika, when someone brought up England’s six-game winning streak over the Wallabies.If England lose on Saturday, he is also keenly aware that Jones will cop it from both hemispheres. Unlikely, perhaps, but it is 12 years since England last kept all their World Cup plates spinning at Australia’s expense. Roll on the weekend, mate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6c908a3e1cdd326cf0284f6dcc1aebf5b734c26/0_105_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3566e6ce1ebac1b061280b6b3eed178b","title":"lebron james daryl morey china hong kong nba tweet","story":"The NBA’s most famous current player, LeBron James, has waded in to the ongoing fallout between the league and China with comments that are sure to spark controversy.The lucrative relationship between the league and China has been damaged since the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted in support of anti-government protestors in Hong Kong earlier this month. Morey subsequently deleted the tweet but China has threatened to cut ties with the NBA, and some Chinese companies have backed out of broadcasts and sponsorship deals. James was asked about the situation before his team, the Los Angeles Lakers, played the Golden State Warriors in a pre-season game on Monday. “I don’t want to get into a ... feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn’t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke,” James said. “Just be careful what we tweet ... even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.” James later said he meant Morey wasn’t educated on the repercussions of the tweet rather than the situation in Hong Kong. Law enforcement have used live ammunition on civilians after months of demonstrations in Hong Kong.“Let me clear up the confusion,” he wrote on Twitter. “I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I’m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.”James’s comments will be jarring to many, as he has been an eloquent voice on social issues and human rights – including police brutality within the US. The NBA, which has won plaudits for encouraging its players to speak out on politics and social justice, has also struggled to handle the situation. The league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, has scrambled to repair the NBA’s relationship with China, which is worth tens of millions of dollars to the league and its players, while defending Morey’s right to free speech. According to ESPN, Silver held a meeting with Lakers and Brooklyn Nets players when the teams played a pre-season game in China last week. Many of the players are said to have been angry that they had to field questions from Chinese reporters on the fallout before Silver had done so. “I feel like with this particular situation, not only was I not informed enough about,” James said on Monday. “I just felt like it was something not only myself or my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time. And we still feel the same way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629c6da47e7dc57cc2c537edf1d98a25a6c9f7f2/26_136_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36af3425de0f29377a84a69022fa80f1","title":"talking horses ralph beckett ascot champions day","story":"Andover trainer came up trumps at Newmarket and York on Saturday and he has two live shots for Champions Day at AscotThe hottest trainer in Britain just now, Ralph Beckett, has a chance to make his mark on Champions Day at Ascot and has his fingers crossed that the excellent form of his stable near Andover can continue until the weekend. Beckett will be represented in the Fillies \u0026amp Mares Stakes by Antonia De Vega, whose odds crashed from 25-1 to 10-1 as the latest entries were made on Monday for the Qipco-sponsored event.His horses have been running well in recent weeks but even so he was stunned to win four races from five runners on Newmarket’s valuable Saturday card, while his only runner at York also won a good prize that day. This Saturday’s race amounts to a significant step up in class for Antonia De Vega but Beckett knows what is required, having won the race with Simple Verse four years ago.“It was terrific,” he said of his experience at Newmarket. “The problem I had all day was that the one I fancied most was Feliciana De Vega in the last and of course you think your luck’s going to run out at any second. I certainly hope my form will carry on to the weekend. Whether it will or not is another matter …“Antonia De Vega had a small problem after an abortive trip to Ireland in the summer but I’ve been pleased with her lately and she did a nice piece in a racecourse gallop at Kempton last Friday. So we think she’s going to be ready but it’s difficult to be certain.”Beckett also expects to run the mud-loving Mitchum Swagger in the handicap at the end of the Champions Day card. “This is right up his alley,” he said.The going at Ascot is reported as heavy and the long-established flat course is waterlogged in places at Swinley Bottom. With more rain to come, it is thought likely the round-course races, including the £1m Champion Stakes, will be switched to what is normally the hurdles circuit, where the surface is drier and described as good to soft, soft in places.That would not be ideal for Beckett, given Antonia De Vega has a noted preference for very soft ground. He is also concerned that the tighter inner circuit might produce a draw bias, with those on the outside being at a disadvantage.A dozen horses are still entered for the Champion Stakes, Fox Tal having been supplemented at a cost of £75,000 on Monday. Aidan O’Brien has the top two in the betting, Magical and Japan, while there was support for the British-based Addeybb, whose preference for soft ground is well known.The only other supplementary entry was Make A Challenge, added to the Champions Sprint at a cost of £40,000. Denis Hogan’s horse was an impressive winner at The Curragh on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a5fd264f5ac7ba745792c819545438bc83cb7e/0_1140_1647_987/master/1647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f85175959a8c4c3fbd16ae12deacd3b","title":"armchair viewers laser guided rugby union kipchoge","story":"While the glorious phenomenon that is Simone Biles was winning a fifth all‑around world gymnastics title last week with routines that included a triple-twisting double backflip during the floor exercise and a two‑flips‑two-twists dismount from the beam, she was doing things that the human eye could barely take in. But there were no worries that what she was doing might be missed.Her every movement, and those of her 546 rivals, was being captured by three-dimensional laser sensors hidden inside boxes placed around the floor of the Stuttgart arena. Developed by Fujitsu, the system has at its centre an artificial intelligence system. Body measurements are taken from the competitors – in the case of the few who declined in Stuttgart, a standard template was used – and their movements are then tracked for position, angle and speed, instantly processed and fed to the competition judges in graphic form as a clear real-time analysis of every performance.That, you might think, will settle everything. No more Eurovision-style complaints about the Belarus judge favouring the Russian competitor. No more claims of the Chinese marking down the USA team, or vice versa. In theory, at least.In sports where artistry is not a consideration, however, the future beckons – and it would appear to be laser-guided. There was a glimpse of it when Eliud Kipchoge broke two hours for the marathon distance, following a wedge of pacemakers whose eyes were glued to the green laser lines beamed on to the road surface in Vienna from an SUV with a throttle specially tuned and controlled so that its speed could be adjusted in increments of 0.1kmh.Admiration for Kipchoge’s magnificent million-dollar achievement was only slightly undermined by the information that he was wearing a version of Nike’s Vaporfly running shoe so new that it has not yet been homologated by the governing body. Like other aspects of his run, such as the use of roll-in, roll-out pacemakers, this made it clear that his feat belonged not in the realm of sport but in the related field of science-assisted human performance. What you might feel about the value of such an achievement when it is entirely orced from the sphere of rules-based competition is entirely up to you.But laser sensors would have come in very useful in a piece of proper sport on Sunday, when Wales’s backs persisted in throwing forward passes while trying to score during their Rugby World Cup pool match against Uruguay in Kumamoto. In the end these infringements of the game’s most basic rule did not cost them victory and passage to the quarter-finals, but they were careless and frustrating. And not wholly surprising, either, since it is some time since greater fitness and more advanced tactical thinking persuaded coaches to bring attacking lines into flatter alignment, with the aim of finding gaps or engaging the opposing defence as quickly as possible.The debate over what constitutes a forward pass between players running at speed flared up a few years ago, with all manner of brave but inconclusive attempts at scientific analysis. Video refereeing has meant that infringements are more easily spotted, but – as with VAR in football – they have also tended to make the referee on the pitch more reluctant to blow the whistle, secure in the knowledge that the technology will absolve him by providing a definitive verdict.With five minutes to go on Sunday, Hallam Amos scored the third of his touchdowns to be disallowed. The first two had been chalked off for forward passes after being referred to the TMO. The third was actually disallowed for his inability to hold on to the ball as he ed over by the corner flag. In fact it should already have been disallowed for the forward pass preceding his final dash. But that was never even considered. Weirdly, Angus Gardner invited the TMO to adjudicate on the second offence rather than the first.One day perhaps international rugby players will be measured in the same way as the gymnasts in Stuttgart, tracked in real time by laser sensors placed along the touchlines. The ball, too, will be tracked, and the TMO will be able to see without recourse to the naked eye whether it travelled forward as it passed from one set of hands to another. If nothing else, that would speed up a process that can be infuriatingly protracted and does not always deliver an undisputed verdict. And, through some kind of red-button option, viewers at home would be able to decide whether they wanted to watch a match with the laser lines and other data on display – somewhat in the manner of the course and wind overlays in the America’s Cup telecasts – or au naturel.Everybody wants accurate decisions and there is certainly an audience for more detailed analysis. But once this television-influenced path has been chosen, it is impossible to know where the journey will end, or what effect it will have on the uncertainty, the wonder, the exhilaration and the arguments that made sport more than a thing of statistics. But at least as long as Simone Biles is around, the wonder and the exhilaration are guaranteed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25abce4cdfd84799f4b9e30db3106f8105d656dc/0_142_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=619298e63916696e06425700dcf4fbc0","title":"send tip winter festival europe win 200 pounds hotel voucher","story":"Spectacular light shows, parades, fireworks, food and drink bacchanals, art shows, carnivals … tell us about the best winter event you’ve experienced on your travelsAs the clocks go back and evening skies darken, outdoor events take on a special atmosphere, whether they are on city streets, up mountains or in forests.

Nine of them were cleared of violent rebellion but convicted of the lesser charges of sedition and misuse of public funds.How has the independence movement evolved over recent years and why have some of its key figures ended up in the dock?There has been a growing clamour in the past decade for independence from those Catalans who believe their wealthy region has a moral, cultural and political right to self-determination, and that it has long put more into Spain economically than it has received in return.But even though successive pro-independence Catalan governments have purported to speak for all Catalans, polls have consistently shown the region is evenly split on the independence issue.Calls for independence grew as Spain endured a painful and protracted economic crisis. Artur Mas, the then Catalan president, switched to supporting independence in 2011 at a time of widespread anger over his centre-right Convergence and Union (CiU) party’s austerity policies. Critics have accused him of a cynical manoeuvre to redirect that fury against the central government in Madrid.Many people in the region were also angered by the Spanish constitutional court’s decision in 2010 to annul or reinterpret parts of the 2006 Catalan statute of autonomy, which would have afforded the region greater independence. In short, by holding two referendums in contravention of Spain’s 1978 constitution, which is founded on the “indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation”.Three years later, the government of Mas’s successor, Carles Puigdemont, ignored warnings from the Spanish government and the country’s constitutional court and pushed ahead with a unilateral referendum.Pro-independence parties managed to get a law for the referendum passed in the regional parliament in early September 2017, despite furious objections from opposition MPs, who said usual procedures had been disregarded. The law was eventually struck down by Spain’s constitutional court.The Spanish government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, also insisted the vote would not go ahead and deployed thousands of police officers to Catalonia.The police action made front-page news across the world, damaging Spain’s reputation, while the referendum plunged the country into the worst political and constitutional crisis since its return to democracy.Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence nine days later but proposed its effects be suspended for two months to allow for dialogue. Pro-independence Catalan MPs nevertheless voted on 27 October 2017 to unilaterally declare independence from Spain in a session boycotted by dozens of opposition MPs.Less than an hour later, the Spanish senate approved the use of article 155 of the constitution, which allowed Rajoy’s government to assume direct rule of Catalonia, sack Puigdemont and his cabinet, and call a snap regional election.Direct rule was lifted in June 2018 when the new Catalan government was sworn in.Key members of Puigdemont’s government and two leading grassroots pro-independence activists, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sànchez, were arrested and charged.Nine of the 12 defendants – who include Cuixart, Sànchez, the former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras and the former Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell – are accused of rebellion, which carries a prison sentence of up to 25 years.Puigdemont and three of his former cabinet ministers fled into self-imposed exile in Belgium before they could be arrested.That’s the big question. The Catalan independence movement has always been characterised by its peaceful nature. The regional president, Quim Torra, has called on Catalans to greet guilty verdicts with “a huge show of non-violent civil disobedience”.However, direct action – including the blocking of roads and railway lines – is expected from the so-called Committees for the Defence of the Republic.In late September, police in Barcelona arrested nine people associated with the CDR who were allegedly planning to sabotage Catalan infrastructure. Seven of them have been remanded in custody and are accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation and possessing explosives.Spain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has shown a more conciliatory approach to the independence issue than Rajoy, but has ruled out a referendum and stressed any negotiations will have to adhere to the constitution.Sánchez has warned his caretaker government could apply article 155 if necessary, but he has also spoken of the need for coexistence in the region.The independence movement, meanwhile, has lost momentum since the referendum. While Puigdemont, Torra and others favour maintaining the pressure on Madrid by following a unilateral path towards independence, Junqueras’s party, the Catalan Republican Left, is pushing for a less confrontational and more practical approach.Whatever the supreme court verdict, any answers to the Catalan question are likely to remain as elusive as ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd3b105deef25255fdde95925268859537a3057b/155_0_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfa1c71735563d4ba5eb7676e348a022","title":"the aftermath of typhoon hagibis in pictures","story":"Japan’s Typhoon Hagibis made landfall south of Tokyo on Saturday evening with heavy rain, which flooded the city and surrounding areas.

All figures are compared with the last poll, carried out before the local and European elections in May.Support for Labour and Sinn Féin also declines slightly, while support for the Green Party has doubled from 4 per cent to 8 per cent since the last poll. Independents and other small parties see their aggregate rating unchanged.The increase in the satisfaction rating for the Taoiseach and the Government will most encourage Fine Gael as the party contemplates a possible pre-Christmas election in the event of a deal being concluded on Brexit.Mr Varadkar sees his personal rating jump by 15 points since May, ending an 18-month long period of decline. More than half of all voters (51 per cent) now say they are satisfied with Mr Varadkar’s performance as Taoiseach, his best rating in a year.Approval for the Government has also risen, with 42 per cent now saying they are satisfied with its performance, up from 31 per cent in May.In addition, there is strong approval for the Government’s handling of both the economy and Brexit. More than half of all voters (54 per cent) say the Government is doing a good job on handling the economy while six out of 10 voters (60 per cent) approve of the Government’s handling of Brexit.On making a compromise on the backstop, however, voters are almost evenly split – a small majority among those who expressed a preference (47 per cent) suggested that the Government should not compromise on the backstop to achieve a deal, even if this risks a hard border, with 42 per cent in favour of compromise.The approval rating for the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has risen slightly, from 35 per cent to 38 per cent, though in his case the last comparative figure dates from March.The state of the parties, when undecided voters are excluded, is: Fine Gael, 29 per cent (no change) Fianna Fáil, 25 per cent (down one) Sinn Féin, 14 per cent (down two) Labour, 6 per cent (down one) Independentsothers, 18 per cent (no change) Greens, 8 per cent (up four).Among the smaller parties and Independents, Solidarity-People Before Profit are at 1 per cent (down one) among voters declaring a preference, the Social Democrats are at 1 per cent (down one), Independents4Change are at 2 per cent (no change), the Independent Alliance is at less than 1 per cent (no change), non-party Independents are on 10 per cent (down two) and other groups and parties are on 2 per cent (down one).The poll was taken on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, among a total of 1,200 voters across 120 sampling points in all constituencies. The accuracy is estimated at plus or minus 2.8 per cent at the national level.MethodologyThis survey in the Republic of Ireland was conducted exclusively on behalf of The  by Ipsos MRBI, among a national quota sample of 1,200 representative of the c.3.6m adults aged 18 upwards, covering 120 sampling points throughout all constituencies in the Republic.Since February 2016, a question on voting importance has been included.

On the night, what happened behind the scenes provided the greatest plot twist of all.In a deliberate flouting of the rules, the jury decided to split the prize between two books, Atwood’s The Testaments and Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other.Told in no uncertain terms that the rulebook allowed only one winner, the chair of the judges, Peter Florence, refused to give way.It culminated in a bizarre press conference in which Florence announced the decision while the exasperated director of the prize, Gaby Wood, stood by.“They have actively broken the rules. It’s not that we accommodated the jury, it’s that the jury actively chose to reject the rules,” explained Wood. “They effectively staged a sit-in in the judging room.”Over five hours on Monday, discussions between the jury and Wood, who was acting as intermediary for the prize trustees, went back and forth. The jury won the day.Wood insisted she was resigned, rather than angry, about the “gesture”. “There was nothing unclear about my communication of the rules but that was the choice they made and you have to respect it.” She added that previous juries had entertained the idea of splitting the prize, but had accepted that it was not allowed.It was the most dramatic act of Booker insurrection since the 1976 chair, Philip Larkin, threatened to jump out of the window if his favourite book didn’t win (it did).Florence, director of the Hay Festival, said the Extinction Rebellion protesters massed in the streets close to the Guildhall venue had provided a note of inspiration.“Today of all days, when rebellion is in the air - maybe we were a little moved by that,” he said.“We came down to a discussion with the director of the Booker Prize about the rules. And we were told quite firmly that the rules state that you can only have one winner. “And as we have managed the jury all the way through on the principle of consensus, our consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and ide this year’s prize to celebrate two winners.”Rather than some jurors favouring one book and some rooting for the other, all were unanimous in their desire to see both take the prize, Florence said.“The more we talked about them, the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners.  I think rules are adaptable to the circumstance and our circumstance this year... brought the jury to the conclusion that the only result we were happy with was to award the prize this year to both these books.”The prize has been split twice before - between Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton in 1974, and Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth in 1992. Feeling that a shared award detracted from the books, with one always better-remembered than the other, the rules were changed in 1993 to require one winner only.Atwood’s novel is a long-awaited sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale and is comfortably the best-selling hardback of 2019, shifting close to 180,000 copies since its release last month.Evaristo’s novel has sold a more modest 3,976 copies. She is the first British woman of colour to win the prize and her book tells 12 inter-linked stories about black women across the generations.Florence said he hoped neither author would mind coming away with a £25,000 cheque rather than £50,000.“Much as I treasure the idea of the Booker Prize and the amount of money that’s given, I don’t think its power and value resides solely in the cash,” he said.He also rejected the idea that being made to share the prize with one of the world’s most famous authors would overshadow Evaristo’s achievement.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

All cheese production must take place in the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, where the cheese has been made in the same vein for 1,000 years.While family producers still exist, around 70 per cent of genuine roquefort made according to “protected designation of origin”, or PDO, rules is produced by Société des Caves, a brand owned by the world’s biggest dairy group, Lactalis.Société recently launched a cheese called bleu de brebis (Ewes’ Blue) which uses pasteurised milk, is cheaper and milder in taste. It sports the same brand name and the green packaging is very similar to the original.Roquefort sheep rearers must leave their ewes to graze freely as part of the appellation rulesUnionists at the producer complain it is shooting itself in the foot by launching the new cheese, as it will push down sales of roquefort that have already dropped 16 per cent in a decade to six million wheels.Last month, they teamed up with “yellow vest” protesters to storm a supermarket in Millau selling the new blue-veined rival, forcing the manager to remove it from his shelves.Société argues it is simply catering to changing tastes. “Roquefort no longer fits the requirements of some consumers who want a milder product,” Societé’s director general Christian Gentil told Les Echos. “So we have brought out bleu de brebis, which is not a roquefort ersatz and is made with local milk as indicated on the packet.”However, INAO, the French body that defines cheese-making rules, recently issued a warning that Société risked misleading consumers with “false or fallacious” marketing given that it is “historically, legally and commercially” linked to roquefort.But with no ruling expected until next year, the plight of true roquefort has been taken up by José Bové - a farmer and Green MEP famed for having trashed a MacDonald’s to protest against “crap food” and US restrictions on importing roquefort.Dismissing bleu de brebis as “Canada Dry” roquefort, he announced his intention to take the fight to court. “For me, there is only one solution to this crisis: a ban and an end to production of this blue cheese,” he told Libération.Roquefort is by no means the only French fromage under attack from pasteurised rivals.Defenders of “real” camembert have been fighting a long-running battle to protect the gooey cheese made with raw milk from similar-sounding pasteurised interlopers. INAO is due to rule on new labels differentiating the two next month.Bleu de brebis is not the only reason for roquefort to be cheesed off. Sheep farmers in the area have issued increasingly plaintive warnings that their flocks face attacks from wolves, long eradicated from the area.However, there could be one silver lining for the blue cheese while British stilton and cheddar face retaliatory tariffs as part of Donald Trump’s ongoing battle with the European Union over aircraft subsidies, roquefort is apparently not on the list.That prompted Reuters\u0027 Michel Rose to ask: “Is there a Roquefort aficionado in the Trump administration? Chaos at Barcelona airport as protesters clash with police after independence leaders jailedDonald Trump imposes sanctions on Turkey for Syria offensiveMore than half of A\u0026ampEs now failing as breakdowns in non-emergency care sees flood of desperate patientsHomeschooling on rise as some parents teach children themselves to avoid prosecution for truancyManchester Airport named worst for waiting time at security, Which? findsBBC presenters under pressure to \u0026#39stir things up\u0026#39 as social media stars, John Sergeant warnsDuchess of Cambridge wears traditional style outfit as Duke says Pakistan can rely on the UK \u0026#39as a key partner and friend\u0026#39More than half of children in custody are from ethnic minorities for first time, probation report revealsSoldier wounded during search for Bowe Bergdahl dies of his injuriesBooker Prize plot twist: Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo share award after jury breaks rules Backstop compromise is still on, but trade issue could yet derail Brexit agreementJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s closest aide warned he is next \u0026#39on the list\u0026#39 amid claims John McDonnell is plotting a \u0026#39Soviet\u0026#39 style purgeComment: Trapped by Parliament, Boris has little choice but to make concessions in search of a deal\tBrexit deal hopes rise as \u0026#39last-minute compromises are made\u0026#39Government risks being the first since 1924 to lose Commons vote on a Queen’s SpeechPolice response to \u0026#39transphobic\u0026#39 stickers branded \u0026#39extraordinary\u0026#39Britain accused of putting trade deals before condemnation of TurkeyVictims of repeat burglaries rise by 16 per cent in a year as \u0026#39organised crime gangs exploits police gaps\u0026#39Fort Worth policeman who killed woman through window of her own home resignsStressed women are more likely to give birth to a girl, study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/15/comet.jpg","title":"alien comet oumuamua borisov space solar system interstellar object","story":"Subscribe nowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027We really hoped to receive this message one day. We only didn\u0027t know when\u0027An interstellar comet visiting our solar system is like nothing ever seen before, scientists have confirmed – but looks strangely familiar.The object, known as\u0026nbsp2IBorisov, has been examined by researchers who say that it has the potential to transform our understanding of the universe that surrounds us.Scientists have long thought that the gaps between the stars could be home to various comets and asteroids that have been thrown out of their home planetary systems. As they make their way through the universe, they would pass through our solar system and give us the opportunity to spot them, astronomers speculated.The first of those objects was seen two years ago, when scientists saw \u0027Oumuamua, and confirmed that such interstellar objects exist. Since then, they have been watching in hope of seeing another interstellar visitor.Astronomers now know that\u0026nbsp2IBorisov\u0026nbspis the second such alien visitor ever seen – and the first of its kind, a comet sailing through our solar system from another place entirely.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

We only didn\u0027t know when, said Piotr\u0026nbspGuzik\u0026nbspof the\u0026nbspJagiellonian\u0026nbspUniversity, who led a new study of the object.Scientists release picture of first comet from another solar systemResearchers were able to take pictures within two days that gave researchers a significant look at the object, and let them confirm that it was the first comet to visit us from another planetary system.We immediately noticed the familiar coma and tail that were not seen around \u0027Oumuamua, said Michal Drahus of the Jagiellonian University, who co-led the study with Guzik. This is really cool because it means that our new visitor is one of these mythical and never-before-seen \u0027real\u0027 interstellar comets.Further investigation suggested that it was oddly familiar, for something that had made its journey over such a distant way. Researchers found that it looks reddish and has a solid core that is about a kilometre across.Make of this what you will, but based on these initial characteristics, this object appears indistinguishable from the native Solar System comets, said\u0026nbspGuzik.Researchers will now be able to keep watching the object and learn more about it as it becomes even more visible.The comet is still emerging from the Sun\u0027s morning glare and growing in brightness. It will be observable for several months, which makes us believe that the best is yet to come, said\u0026nbspWaclaw\u0026nbspWaniak\u0026nbspof the\u0026nbspJagiellonian\u0026nbspUniversity, co-author of the study.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Atwood won for\u0026nbspThe Testaments, her sequel to\u0026nbspThe Handmaid’s Tale, while Evaristo won for her novel\u0026nbspGirl, Woman, Other.The Testaments, which became the fastest-selling hardback novel in four years on its publication\u0026nbspin September, is set 15 years after the final scene of\u0026nbspThe Handmaid’s Tale. The first book was adapted for a film starring Natasha Richardson in 1990 and is currently the basis for the Bafta-winning TV\u0026nbspseries starring Elisabeth Moss.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspdeemed it an\u0026nbsp”addictively readable, fast-paced adventure about the collapse of Gilead”.Girl, Woman, Other\u0026nbspis Evaristo’s eighth book of fiction. It tells the stories of 12 characters, mostly black British women. The novel was hailed by\u0026nbspStylist\u0026nbspas “exceptional” and “ambitious” and described\u0026nbspby the\u0026nbspNew Statesman as\u0026nbsp”a story for our times”.It’s the third time the Booker Prize has gone to two joint winners. The first instance was in 1974, when it went to\u0026nbspto Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton. The most recent case came in 1992, when\u0026nbspMichael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth were both announced as winners. A change in rules allowed only one author to win the prize from 1993 on, but the judges decided to ignore that change when time came to pick the winners of the 2019 decision.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived.

On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them.“They left the judging room happy and proud, their twin winners gesturing towards the six they would have wanted, had it been possible to split the prize any further.”Evaristo is the first black woman to receive the Booker Prize since its creation in 1969.Atwood is the fourth author to have won it twice, and\u0026nbspThe Testaments\u0026nbspis the third sequel to have emerged as a winner.Salman Rushdie, who was among the shortlisted authors for 2019, was one of this year’s\u0026nbspfrontrunners for\u0026nbspQuichotte.\u0026nbspHe and Atwood have both won the coveted literary prize before, in 2000 and 1981 respectively.

By sharing details of the phone, the technology giant was attempting to take back the narrative from the leakers, gossips and rumour merchants that fill the pages of the tech press in the build-up to a major product launch.But the limited amount of information imparted only seemed to serve as bait, with publications picking apart each picture\u0026nbspto determine what hardware features to expect. Along with dual-rear cameras, the images also revealed an additional sensor that became noticeable when the contrast of one image was adjusted.Moreover, Google\u0027s revelations didn\u0027t prevent the usual slew of rumours, with Google and its production partners seemingly more leaky than dear Liza\u0027s bucket.The official unveiling of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will take place on 15 October at an event in New York City, but with little left to announce it will likely be almost entirely ceremonial. For those not keen on sitting through a two hour presentation, The Independent\u0026nbsphas a run down of everything that\u0027s expected to be announced.As with most smartphone makers this year, the main upgrade for Google\u0027s latest device will almost certainly be the camera.Both the front- and rear-facing cameras will see considerable improvements, with an additional 16-megapixel telephoto lens at the back being complimented by complex sensors at the front that will enable the same depth-aware facial recognition that is featured on the latest\u0026nbspiPhones.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

A camera block at the back is reminiscent of the iPhone 11\u0027s setup and houses both lenses and sensors.Leaked photos also seem to show that there is no longer a fingerprint reader on the rear of the device, though this may still be featured beneath the screen itself.There will three colours for the Pixel 4: \u0027just black\u0027, \u0027clearly white\u0027 and \u0027oh so orange\u0027. There may also be a \u0027mint green\u0027 version of the phone, though this is not certain.Android 10 and a 5G versionGoogle\u0027s latest mobile operating system was announced in August,\u0026nbsprevealing a complete overhaul to the world\u0027s most popular software. As always, Google\u0027s own devices were the first to include Android 10 and so there is no doubt it will appear on the two new Pixel 4 phones.One of the most highly-anticipated features of Android 10 is Live Caption, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically transcribe speech from audio or videos playing on the phone.AFPGetty Images)Whilst fundamentally an accessibility feature, allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing users to better consume content, it will also be a perk to anyone hoping to surreptitiously watch videos without disturbing those around them.Google is also reportedly working on a 5G version of the Pixel 4, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which would see the tech giant beat its old foe Apple to releasing a next-generation device.Release date and priceWhile the date of the announcement is already known, it is not clear yet when the phones will actually be released. If past Pixel cycles are anything to go by, pre-orders will open the day of the unveiling, with the release date coming before the end of the month.Last year, the Pixel 3 was revealed on 9 October and released nine days later on 18 October.No amount of leaks have given a certain indication of the exact price of the new phones, though listings discovered by 9to5Google\u0026nbspsuggest the Pixel 4 will cost 820 euros (£727) and the Pixel 4 XL will be 1,127 euros (£999).Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Real bad,” he wrote on Sunday.\u0026nbsp”Joaquin Phoenix’s performance was a GOOD thing... in a BAD movie. Also, Joker was a bad Joker movie.”“The most frustrating thing about the Joker movie... There are so many EXCELLENT DC Comics that dance around the Joker’s origins. ANY of those –\u0026nbspjust using the comic pages as storyboards – would have made a far better movie than what they put up on the screen,” he added.Created with Sketch.25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident.

(If you saw Joker, you know what I’m talking about.) That was the rancid little cherry on top of this god awful sundae.”Joker would have been a whole different character were he not whiteJared Leto ‘alienated and upset’ by new Joker movieWhile some agreed with Slott, he received enough criticism to prompt him to speak out again.“Me: Here’s my opinion on something.

They included an experiment known as Labeled Release, or LR, which was intended to look for signs of life on the planet.The results came back in 1976 – and seemed to indicate that something was happening on the surface.\u0026nbspGilbert V\u0026nbspLevin – an engineer and inventor who was the principal investigator on the experiment – has now written a long article arguing that those findings were indications of life on Mars, which were ignored by Nasa.On July 30, 1976, the LR returned its initial results from Mars, Levin wrote in an article for Scientific American.\u0026nbspAmazingly, they were positive.As the experiment progressed, a total of four positive results, supported by five varied controls, streamed down from the twin Viking spacecraft landed some 4,000 miles apart. The data curves\u0026nbspsignaled\u0026nbspthe detection of microbial respiration on the Red Planet. The curves from Mars were similar to those produced by LR tests of soils on Earth.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberIt seemed we had answered that ultimate question.But Nasa\u0027s experiments failed to find organic matter: the physical stuff of life itself, not just the indications of microbial respiration that the LR experiment discovered. That meant that Nasa concluded that the LR results came from a substance that was mimicking life but was not actually life itself.Comet visiting our solar system is \u0027like nothing seen before\u0027Since then, Nasa has not a run a similar experiment has focused on examining whether the Martian habitat could be a suitable home for alien life.But Levin argues that those findings actually suggested that\u0026nbspthere is alien life on Mars. And, he argued, Nasa must do more to follow them up – because they could pose a significant threat to life on Earth.NASA maintains the search for alien life among its highest priorities, he wrote.\u0026nbspOn February 13, 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said we might find microbial life on Mars.Our nation has now committed to sending astronauts to Mars. Any life there might threaten them, and us upon their return. Thus, the issue of life on Mars is now front and center.Summing up the evidence of alien life, he wrote his experiment had found a whole host of positive results. But perhaps most strongly of all, he said there had been no experiment that had provided an alternative explanation for the results that came back from the LV experiment.What is the evidence against the possibility of life on Mars? The astonishing fact is that there is none, he wrote. Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.In his conclusion, he asked that Nasa\u0026nbspconduct the same kind of experiments again, taking an altered version of the LR experiment to Mars on the next possible trip. And he asked that scientists be convened to examine those more than 40-year-old findings to see if they really were proof of life on Mars.Such an objective jury might conclude, as I did, that the Viking LR did find life, he wrote.\u0026nbspIn any event, the study would likely produce important guidance for NASA’s pursuit of its holy grail.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. The autobiography is co-written by Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton.Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years is out on Tuesday.the sound of music\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspSound of Music\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On Monday, shadow voting minister Cat Smith claimed the announcement was a “blatant attempt by the Tories to rig the result of the next general election”.Voter ID, intended to “tackle electoral fraud and protect our democracy”,\u0026nbspis among a number of electoral changes the government is seeking to introduce. Under the scheme, anyone who does not have photographic ID will be able to apply for a free document proving their identity.But Darren Hughes, of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), said\u0026nbsp“these plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

There’s a very significant risk that this is going to lead to people not being able to vote.”Johnson Brexit policies ‘risk retaliatory deportations’ for Britons living in EUIn trials of such schemes, people have refused on principle to hand over their driving licence or passport,\u0026nbspdisplaying a “philosophical resistance” to the idea, Prof James said.The director of Age UK, Caroline Abrahams, said Mr Johnson’s move towards voter ID was “crazy”. In a statement, she told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“Many older people do not have any photographic ID so we sincerely hope the government is not going to legislate so this becomes a requirement before anyone is allowed to vote.“It would risk disenfranchising millions of older people, among others, and so on the face of it seems a crazy idea to propose.”In a report from December 2015 the independent Electoral Commission said that about 3.5 million electors did not have an acceptable form of photo ID. Nonetheless, the regulator backed a voter ID scheme.In 2017, a University of California study found that strict\u0026nbspvoter ID laws in the US tended to “skew democracy in favour of whites and those on the political right”. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, called the Conservative plans “such an obvious US voter suppression move”, while Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: “The people the Tories are trying to stop voting will be disproportionately poor and from ethnic minority backgrounds.”A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said:\u0026nbsp”Electoral fraud is an unacceptable crime that strikes at a core principle of our democracy.“Showing ID to vote is a reasonable and proportionate way to protect our elections – it is something people already do in everyday life and voters in Northern Ireland have been doing it with ease for decades.“Voter ID is one part of a body of work this Government is delivering to give the public confidence that our elections are secure and fit for the 21st century.”In a briefing note circulated in advance of the Queen’s Speech, the government said its move was based on a 2016 review of elections by Eric Pickles.The Independent\u0026nbspunderstands the rules will be introduced by way of primary legislation with a view to passing a bill before the next scheduled general election in 2022.Queen’s Speech ignores Brexit to kick off a Tory election campaignIn additional plans introduced\u0026nbspon Monday, campaigners are to be banned from handling postal votes and a limit imposed on how many postal votes one person can hand in. Postal voters will be required to re-register every three years.People will only be allowed to vote by proxy for two other electors at most, regardless of their relationship, while ministers will also try to make voting easier for people with disabilities.Meanwhile, an “imprints regime” will be created to police online election material to “make it clearer to the electorate who has produced and promoted” it – following widespread controversy over the use of social media for targeted campaigns. In a related move, ministers will consult on measures to protect elections from foreign interference.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, commander of the SDF, described the operation as an “existential threat” to Syria’s Kurds.The agreement could spell the end of a years-long experiment in autonomy led by Syria’s Kurds, and marks a major shift in alliances for the embattled community.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkey has long threatened to attack the SDF, which it considers a terror organisation for its links to a Kurdish separatist group that has fought the Turkish state for decades.

The presence of US troops in Syria alongside the group had acted as a deterrence for a Turkish assault. That changed quickly last week when Donald Trump made a shock announcement that the US would not stand in the way of Turkey’s plans to enter Syria. The SDF described the abrupt shift as a “stab in the back”.The deal will see the Syrian army deployed along a large stretch of the Turkey-Syria border, the SDF said, in an effort to deter any further Turkish incursion.The agreement brings its own dangers, however. For decades, Kurds in Syria have faced repression and discrimination at the hands of the government.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube. But that has nothing to do with weight . . . and everything to do with how off-putting it is to sit next to someone scoffing a stinking kebab.It is pretty straightforward to work outsomeone wants to have sex with you. And more importantly, when they don’t.Both my kids know how to respect others, as well as themselves. They learned it well before they got to uni.If you need to do this course when you start at university, it might already be too late.THE issue of kne crime in the capital was brought closer to home than ever for me when a schoolboy was stabbed at .pm in Stratford, East London.The attack took place in broad daylight, just after school ended, on West Ham’s doorstep.Just like that, another le was snuffed out and a family devastated.We must finally make this a priority before yet more children die needlessly.What will her one-year-old twins Leo and Lenon thinkthey read that in years to come  Maybe they will assume she was joking.Each of my two kids thinks I prefer the other one.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While other stars including Rita Ora and Kylie’s sister Kendall have posted snaps of themselves holding cute bunnies — fuelling the increase in popularity.Cara’s pet, Cecil, even has his own Instagram account.But Megan’s severe condition means she may never make a full recovery.Owner Jodie Salt, , from Frodsham, Cheshire, said: “The vet said it was an ear infection, and suspected ear parasite.“Megan was given antibiotics for the infection, but the vet did say that it’s not uncommon and she may never recover her posture.“It affects her balance so you have to be very careful about picking her up otherwise she starts spinning because she feels disoriented. We really panicked when we first saw her in this state.”Lop eared bunnies — which account for more than half of Britain’s pet rabbits — are some of the worst affected, with experts warning they are more susceptible to a host of medical problems because of their floppy ears.A recent study by the Royal Veterinary College, published in the journal Vet Record, showed lops are far more likely to suffer excessive ear wax, ear pain and dental problems due to the shape of their head.They are also at an increased risk of injury and even prone to obesitytheof their ears restricts their movement, according to the report.Mini lop brothers Comet and Cupid are two such victims — and their problems ended in tragedy.Rae Todd, , from Taunton, Somerset, a director at the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund, rescued the adorable bunnies on Christmas Eve, .She said: “Comet and Cupid weren’t even a year old. A combination of their breed and a poor diet meant that they both had horrendous dental problems.“They were both such lovely boys, but probably both were in extreme pain.“X-rays of Comet’s teeth showed how the roots were erupting out of his jaw. He had to be put to sleep just a few days later.“He had about a week of freedom and love, but he was in such pain that he was not really able to enjoy it.”Cupid was also put to sleep, as was Rudolph, another brother rescued at the same time who had an ear abscess, “the size of a golf ball” and was put on a palliative pain plan.Amy Ockleford, , a press officer, from Horsham, West Sussex, believes her late bunny, Louie also suffered ear problems.She said: “I often wonderedLouie’s lop ears made him partially deaf. He was quite a nervous rabbit and could be shy and skittish around people.“He would frighten easily and was jumpy. As a prey animal, not being able to hear well made him anxious. It’s sad to think that having lop ears impacted on his general state of wellbeing.”It is not just lop eared bunnies who are suffering.A landmark survey of more than , pet rabbits taken by vets found that lives of bunnies of all kinds were being blighted by overgrown claws and teeth, anorexia and myiasis, or flystrike, an often fatal condition caused by flies laying eggs on a rabbit’s skin.Worse still, rabbits kept alone in hutches are thought to suffer crippling loneliness.Dan O’Neill, a vet at the Royal Veterinary College who co-authored the research, said: “In rabbits we have a social species that is kept in isolation. That’s the ultimate punishment.”Then there’s the problem with pedigree breeding, leading to health warnings similar to those about French bulldogs and Persian cats, which have also become popular on social media, but can suffer breathing problems from being bred to have flatter faces.Now vets are warning about rabbit ieties such as the lionhead, which struggles to breath thanks to it short muzzle and mane of fur.Daniella Dos Santos, President of the British Veterinary Association, added: “Sadly, vets tell us that all too often they’re seeing clients who have chosen a pet with certain features without being aware of the serious health and welfare problems they may have as a result.’“It’s critical that prospective owners think ‘health over looks’ when choosing a pet, as extreme features may come hand in hand with hereditary problems that can lead to serious health problems and be distressing and costly to treat.”The University of Nottingham’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Science has just published the results of its global survey of , people in which participants were asked to rate the “cuteness” of pictures of rabbits from one to .The experiment, dubbed “bunny Tinder” was conducted in a bid to combat breeding of rabbits with extreme facial features, such as very flat faces.It found that people are more attracted to animals with mildly flat faces, but interestingly, it also revealed pointed ears are preferable to lop ears.Animal welfare expert and lead author of the study, Naomi Harvey, said: “Despite lop eared rabbits being very popular pets, people actually preferred erect-eared rabbits slightly more than lops.“Since lop-ears are also associated with higher risk of ear and dental problems, this is an interesting find.”The British Rabbit Council, however, believes pet owners should not shy away from lop breeds and its chairwoman, Hazel Elliott, is critical of the survey.She said: “The smaller lops, the dwarves and minis, very rarely have problems. Those make up the highest number of lops.“I’ve had dwarf lops that have lived to  years old and never had an ear problem.“If you speak to people who breed them to show, and would only breed two healthy animals together, I’m quite sure they would report the same.“You can get ear infections in the larger lops, the French and English, but it tends to happen when they have other health problems as well. The problem with the paper is that it was a very small study, undertaken with rabbits from a rabbit rescue who are unlikely to have been very well cared for before they ended up in a rescue.“With studies of this type, it’s really important not to take the evidence too seriously. It would need to be a much bigger study.”Both the RSPCA and British Rabbit Council recommends buying pet rabbits from reputable, responsible breeders.The BRC is happy to put prospective owners in touch with respected breeders.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A survey for the Trussell Trust foodbank network shows % of those quizzed consider hunger to be a problem in the UK. Some % say the gulf between rich and poor has widened - and % say the ability to afford the cost of essentials has worsened. The YouGov study of , people also outlines how % believe poverty has got worse in the last five years. Last year, Trussell Trust foodbanks provided . million emergency aid parcels.  Data shows the main reasons for people needing packages were benefits failing to cover the cost of living, and delays or changes to welfare. The charity commissioned a survey examining what people thought of poverty-fuelled hunger - and who they think is to blame. Some % believe think foodbanks are an embarrassment to this country and % agree they should not exist in modern society - with  % saying the Government is most responsible for addressing hunger. And % agreed most people living in poverty are mired in the state because of Government policies or actions. Charity chief executive Emma Revie said: “This is a clear call to action from people across the UK.  “Iniduals, driven by compassion and justice, are doing what they can to help people facing hunger, but they want to see things change. “It’s now time for our government to do its part, and ensure these strongly-held values are lived out in policies that anchor people from poverty. “It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. “To reach that future, we need to make sure everyone has enough money for the essentials.  “Ensuring our benefits system can anchor people from the rising tide of poverty would make the biggest dference.” Earlier this year a UN special rapporteur said poverty in the UK is “systematic”.

The -year-old monarch is said to have asked for a copy of the Queenaposs Speech a week in advance to ensure there was no slips up during her reading today.Lat month judges ruled that Boris Johnson lied to the Queen over his reasons for proroguing parliament and that the suspension of parliament was unlawful.And body language expert Judi James has studied the reading of the Queenaposs Speech in the House of Lords earlier today.    What body language Judi James said... The Queen is one of the best professional body language maskers in public le, able to disguise her genuine emotions in public to present a regal and often neutral front. This, along with her age, can make reliable readings less accurate than they are with most of those politicians watching her speech today. Overall she appeared stronger than she did during her previous two speeches though, when her voice sounded frail and higher in pitch.    Her lower tone here has more authority, as do the moments when she glances up from her script to fix her ministers with what looks like a meaningful stare. Her speech begins with some facial gestures that in anyone but the Queen might look cynical.As she talks about Brexit she seems to raise one eyebrow and there is a small pulling in of her lips when she mentions the st October."},{"url":null,"title":"queens speech 2019 7 very","story":"NewsQueens Speech :  very awkward details hidden in the small printBoris Johnson tried to use todays Queens Speech as a Tory election broadcast.

Commuter rockets to Mars, scrapping income tax, free unicorns for all - he could promise it all, safe in the knowledge he wonapost have to deliver it. Thataposs because unlike most Queenaposs Speeches, which lay out laws for the coming year, this one is likely to be voted down - and then be scrapped anywaythe country plunges into a snap election. Despite the open goal, though, there are some things in Boris Johnsonaposs announcement that still arenapost that great to look at - or that arenapost mentioned at all. Jeremy Corbyn picked up on some of them when he slammed the lack of action on social care and mental health, adding the speech was shockingly weak on education. Weaposve delved into a bit more detail. Hereaposs some of the small print Boris Johnson didnapost want you to read.  Boris Johnson has been accused of paying lip service to social care after the Queenaposs Speech didnapost give a time limit or details of any reform. Notes to the Queenaposs Speech said: We will bring forward substantive proposals to fix the crisis. But they gave no time limit, did not confirm the nature of any proposals, and did not propose a law in the current one-year Parliament. They repeated an already-announced £.bn cash injection. But £m of that has to be raised by councils through a % rise in the council tax precept. Jane Ashcroft, chief executive of Anchor Hanover, England’s largest not-for-profit provider of care and housing for older people, said: It is exasperating to see government once again pay lip service to social care, and failing to meaningfully address the deepening crisis. Kathryn Hill, Director of England at Carers Trust, said: “Carers Trust is extremely concerned to hear the government is proposing only a partial commitment to reform. Genevieve Edwards, Director of External Affairs at the MS Society, said: “It’s incredibly troubling that social care for working-age disabled people has been dismissed yet again. A No spokesman said the government had set out its commitment to reform social care to end the fear of people having to sell their homes to pay for care. But he admitted: I canapost set out a timeline now. We will be setting it out in due course.  Boris Johnson is accused of using the Queen’s Speech as a “blatant” attempt to rig the result of the next election after it slipped out a pledge to force voters to show ID. Her Majesty said: My Government will take steps to protect the integrity of democracy and the electoral system in the United Kingdom. But the small print confirms this involves ramming ahead with a highly controversial ID scheme, despite concerns it will lock millions out of democracy. Voters will be forced to show an approved form of photographic ID in order to vote - despite there being just eight allegations of fraud at a polling station last year. For comparison, a whopping  people were turned away in a recent trial in eight council areas. The Electoral Reform Society today warned it could be another Windrush - the scandal that saw Brits who came from the Caribbean threatened with deportation. “These plans risk excluding huge numbers of marginalised voters – including many elderly and BAME voters – from our democratic processes and risk undermining free and fair elections, ERS director Dr Jess Garland said. No launched a furious response. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman claimed the absence of voter ID in Britain is a “security risk” and said voter ID has run in Northern Ireland since  “without any impact on the number of people who go and vote”. But askedthe government could point to any evidence of widespread voter fraud at the ballot box, the spokesman did not. And a No spokesman snapped: I’m not sure politically we’ll be taking messages about voter suppression from a party whose main mandate at the moment is to suppress the biggest vote in the democratic history of this country.  The government has produced more than  pages of notes to the Queenaposs Speech. But it has no specic mention of housing, tenants or renting. And crucially, a pledge to end no-fault evictions - where landlords ditch tenants at short notice without good reason - does not appear in the speech at all. When the axe to no-fault evictions was announced under Theresa May in April, the government claimed it would be the biggest change to the private rental sector for a generation. Yet despite a consultation closing on Friday, thereaposs not even lip service paid to it in the governmentaposs notes. That means thereaposs almost zero chance of a legal change in the next year. A No spokesman later insisted the plans had not been dropped altogether. He said: “We absolutely do intend to abolish no fault evictions and will bring forward the appropriate legislation in due course.” But Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: “It’s frustrating to see the housing emergency missing from the government’s agenda in the face of the current crisis. With more than , people homeless and millions fighting for a stable home, this is not something it can ignore. . Action to keep kids safe online isnapost here yet...  Ministers had pledged to improve internet safety for children and vulnerable people. But thereaposs no Bill announced yet in todayaposs Queenaposs Speech - which means a law would be unlikely to come forward in the next year. Last month, ministers pledged they will establish in law a new duty of care making web giants responsible for their users. Yet today, the notes say only: “My Ministers will continue to develop proposals to improve internet safety. Andy Burrows, NSPCC Head of Child Safety Online, said: “Child abuse on the Wild West Web must stop. The Government’s commitment to online harms is positive, but it is crucial it treats children’s safety as a matter of urgency. Boris Johnson must stick to previous commitments and introduce an Online Harms Bill in this session.  There will be a White Paper by the end of this year setting out the governmentaposs response to possible reforms to the Mental Health Act. It comes after pleas for patients not to be detained any more than is absolutely necessary and ensure their views are respected. However there are no immediate plans for a new law in the coming Parliament - as itaposs not one of the  Bills in the Queenaposs Speech. Sophie Corlett of Mind, the mental health charity, said: The urgency of reviewing the Mental Health Act cannot be overstated. Increasing numbers of people being sectioned under the Act are enduring substandard treatment due to poor conditions, lack of choice, loss of dignity and even racial discrimination. This can’t go on. “It is almost a year since the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act was published and we now need to see action. ... Or criminal sanctions for Grenfell-style building owners  The speech documents talk of a fundamental change in the regulations on high-rise tower blocks to ensure accountability and responsibility from their owners. Over the weekend there was talk of this leading to criminal sanctions. But there is no mention in the Queenaposs Speech documents of criminal sanctions. And the crackdown is only planned for some time in the future - it is not one of the  firm laws announced today in the Queenaposs Speech. . Thereaposs still no date for a reform of restaurant workersapos tips  Restaurants will be forced to hand over all tips to staff - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on the loophole. But thereaposs no date in the Queenaposs Speech, or its notes, for when the EmploymentBill might come into force.

Todayaposs Queenaposs Speech - the first for more than two years - includes  Bills with a focus on law and order, the environment and improving animal welfare. Yet it also contains measures that could rig the next election against Labour voters. The vast majority of what was announced today was already announced in the past. And of course none of this has to be implementedan election is triggered in the coming weeks - something most people expect. Plus, it faces being voted down for the first time since  as the PM struggles to govern with a majority hovering near minus . Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: This Queenaposs Speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.    Measures to let workers keep tips and reform orce law will finally be brought back after the Tories dragged their feet. Boris Johnson claimed an Environment Bill will be the huge star of his programme - weeks after Labour backed reaching net zero carbon emissions by  - by imposing new charges on some single use plastics. There will be legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders whoto the UK and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse.    Brexit is of course there too - with measures to end free movement, pass a Brexit deal and carry over trade deals between the UK and EU. And the PM forced the Queen to read out his priority of leaving the EU by October . Boris Johnson bullishly claimed the speech will get the gears on our national gearbox working again as he sung the praises of the NHS and police. The Prime Minister added: This Queenaposs Speech delivers on my promise as PM to get this amazing country of ours moving again. People are tired of stasis, gridlock and waiting for change. THE BREXIT DEAL . EUBill  The first Bill in the Queenaposs Speech will implement any Brexit deal Boris Johnson gets with the EU. It will aim to put into law a new way to prevent checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It will also confirm a transition period, running to December , where we continue to follow EU rules and send money to the EU. We all knew about this already. But crucially, turning it into an Act of Parliament allows MPs to have a vote on Boris Johnsonaposs deal. If he gets it, that is. The PM has until Wednesday to work out something that can be put to  EU leaders at a crucial summit on Thursday. . Fisheries Bill Powers to control access to UK waters will be enshrined in law with licences for foreign vessels - which will no longer have the automatic right to access our seas. New powers will impose restrictions on UK fishermen - either quotas or number of days at sea - to replace the current Common Fisheries Policy. Grants would also be available to fishermen to conserve, enhance and restore the marine and aquatic environment. And EU law could be amended to allow the UK to respond to new advice on fish stocks. . Agriculture Bill The Bill will set up a seven-year transition period that gradually reduces payments to farmers that came under the EUaposs Common Agricultural Policy. The current subsidy system - which rewards the amount of land owned - will be replaced and focus on action farmers take to farm sustainably and help the environment. . Trade Bill The Bill allows the legal carry-over of trade deals that the UK currently enjoys as an EU member. However, this carrying over is still not automatic and the UK would need to negotiate the transition with inidual countries around the world. The Bill also establishes a new independent UK body to protect British firms against unfair trade practices - like dumping of imports such as Chinese steel. CRACKDOWN ON FREE MOVEMENT . Immigration and Social Security Co-OrdinationBill  This is the flagship Bill to end free movement after Brexit - including forcing checks on EU citizens who come to Britain from January . It will pave the way for an Australia-style points-based system, which Ukip has previously backed. It would score potential migrants based on their education, skills and expected salary level. But Home Secretary Priti Patel drew scorn after saying she wants to make the system more generous to people willing to live outside London. Offering preferential treatment to migrants who agree to live in the North of England was branded “confused” and an unworkable “gimmick” - with Labour saying it would do nothing to solve the shortage of workers in the NHS. The Bill doesnapost actually introduce this points-based system - just sets up a framework for it. It will also ensure Irish citizens generally can enter and live in the UK freely. And it will confirm the deadline of December  for new EU arrivals to apply to stay - with or without a Brexit deal.    . Financial Services Bill This Bill will simply the process which allows overseas investment funds to be sold in the UK. The government has trumpeted this as a cutting of red tape, while upholding the UKaposs world-leading standards. But it could prompt fears from some about letting financial markets run free. The Bill also allows for long-term market access to the UK for financial services firms based in Gibraltar. . Private International LawBill This Bill is designed to clary the law on disputes over kids that stretch across national borders. It involves three treaties - the ,  and  Hague Conventions. They include making it harder for parents who leave the country to evade paying child maintenance and allowing co-operation between governments on family cases. . Health Service Safety Investigations Bill A new Health Service Safety Investigations Body will have powers to conduct investigations into NHS incidents that have implications for patient safety. People will be banned from leaking or publishing information held by this body, to ensure witnesses and whistleblowers are more candid. There will also be a duty on the Health Secretary to ensure enough medical examiners are appointed in England. And advice, guidance and training will be provided to local bodies to improve medical probes. HARDLINE TREATMENT OF SERIOUS PRISONERS . Sentencing Bill  Violent criminals and sex offenders will face longer sentences in a tough justice crackdown. The point where prisoners are usually released will be moved from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds - for adults serving at least four years for serious violent and sexual offenders. The focus appears to be a U-turn on previous Tory bids to focus on rehabilitation, which would have removed the need for the shortest sentences in favour of community work. The Bill will also extend the range of reasons a judge can use to slap a whole le prison term on a convicted murderer. . Foreign National Offenders Bill The law and order package includes a bill to drastically increase the sentences for foreign criminals whoto the UK in breach of a deportation order. The exact increase however isnapost actually spelt out in the Queenaposs Speech. Ministers claim the move will help disrupt the activities of international crime gangs. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: We have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long. HELENaposS LAW . PrisonersBill  A new law will make it easier to deny parole to murderers, or those guilty of manslaughter, who refuse to say where their victims are buried. The same law will apply to people who take indecent photographs of children while refusing to say who those children were. The law will be known as Helenaposs Law after -year-old Helen McCourt who was murdered in  - leading to a long campaign by her mother Marie. Her murderer was convicted but has refused to say where he hid her body. Despite claims by ministers, the law wonapost actually force Parole Boards to keep these murderers and paedophiles locked up. Instead it will put a legal obligation on them to take into account the issue when considering release. . Serious Violence Bill There will be a new legal duty on agencies like councils, schools, social services and health providers to work together and share data to prevent serious violence. This will include introducing an explicit priority in law on serious violence for Community Safety Partnerships. It comes after a surge in kne attacks. But critics are likely to complain it is shting the burden onto cuts-hit local authorities. PROTECTION FOR POLICE OVER CAR CHASES . Police Protections Bill Police will face a new test to grade their driving - which can then be taken into accountthey end up being investigated over a crash. This is in a bid to stop police facing prosecution unfairly for people they injure or kill when taking part in a car chase. The Bill will also force the Home Office to report annually on progress on the Police Covenant. And Special Constableswill be able to to get the same support as members of the Police Federation. FUGITIVES ARRESTED WITHOUT A WARRANT . ExtraditionBill This is designed to make it easier for police to arrest internationally wanted fugitives - without the need to apply for a UK arrest warrant. The idea is to cut out a waiting period of six to eight hours which fugitives can use to evade justice. Those being arrested must be subject of an Interpol Red notice. Initially it will only apply to those issued by a limited number of countries with trusted justice systems, the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence group, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and two non-EU European states, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. However the Government will be able to add other countries by minor laws, possibly with minimal scrutiny in Parliament. DOMESTIC ABUSE AND DIVORCE REFORMS FINALLY RETURN . Domestic Abuse Bill The Tories will bring back the Domestic Abuse Bill - which fell as a result of Mr Johnsonaposs unlawful suspension of Parliament. This law was introduced under Theresa May but still wasnapost implemented, to the fury of campaigners. It will stop abusers from being able to cross-examine their victims in the family courts. Victims will be assumed eligible for special measures in criminal courts, like giving evidence via video link. It will create a statutory definition of domestic abuse to include physical violence, emotional abuse, economic abuse and coercive control. And a Domestic Abuse Commissioner will monitor the response of councils and the justice system. . Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Bill Plans for aposquickieapos orces will also come forward again after being stalled under the Tories. Reforms will remove the need to prove bad conduct or a period of separation. Instead couples will be able to just tell a court their marriage has irretrievably broken down. And an obstructive partner will no longer be able to contest a orce from happening. In those measuresapos place will be a -week waiting period between the start of proceedings and the final order for a orce. LONG-DELAYED PLANS TO LET WORKERS KEEP TIPS . EmploymentBill  Restaurants will be forced to hand over tips to staff - more than three years after the Tories first promised to crack down on abuses. The new law in the Queenaposs Speech will force employers to pass on all gratuities in full and to share fairly any pooled tips. The Tories first promised to tackle the injustice under then-business secretary Sajid Javid who ordered a two-month consultation ending on June , . But Theresa May then failed to bring in the change during her time in office. Today the EmploymentBill also introduces a Code of Practice for restaurants, bars and cafes to make the system transparent. Ten years ago, the Mirror launched our Fair Tips campaign with Unite the Union after a Pizza Express manager was sacked for revealing that the company kept % of tips paid by bank cards as an “administration fee”.    . Pension Schemes Bill On pensions there were new rules planned around everything from saving to viewing to accessing your money. First was saving – with plans announced for new “collective” workplace pensions schemes. These would see staff and firms pay into a single, shared, pot rather than inidual pots for each person. The idea is that it could be more efficient and offer better value. Second there were plans to force firms to take part in the new “pensions dashboard” project - this is set to be a single location where you can see all your retirement savings at once. But unless everyone gets involved it wonapost work. So plans to force firms to take part are a needed first step. Finally there were new rules planned about where, when and to who you can transfer your pension to. These are needed as there have been cases where scammers have convinced people to move their money, and honest firms have been powerless to stop it. On a more technical front, there were also bigger penalties and criminal offences planned for firms that break pensions rules and better protection for people saving when companies go bust. . Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill This will aim to roll out gigabit capable broadband across the UK to achieve nationwide coverage as soon as possible. The government claims it will allow faster speeds that can download an HD film in fewer than  seconds. All new build buildings will need the infrastructure to support gigabit connections. And they will have to be installed in most new-build homes. NEW POWERS TO TACKLE DRONES    . Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft Bill Police will be given new powers to tackle the unlawful use of drones. This include forcing a person to land a drone and enhanced stop and search powersan offence involving an unmanned aircraft has taken place. The laws will also apply to model planes and model helicopters. It comes after the number of drone or model aircraft collisions skyrocketed from  in  to  in  - including a spate of shutdowns of Gatwick Airport in a mystery that still hasnapost been resolved. NEW CHARGES ON SINGLE USE PLASTICS . Environment Bill  The government has responded to pressure to ramp up environmental protection. It comes as critics warn that the UKaposs regulations will be weaker than the EUaposs once Brexit happens. The new moves include introducing charges for single use plastics following on from the carrier bag charge. Councils will be given powers to clamp down on sources of air pollution. While communities will have more of a say on the protection of natural habitats through the Local Nature Recovery Strategies. The Queenaposs Speech confirms the creation of a new Office for Environmental Protection first announced last December. It will have the power to take the government to court to enforce environmental law after Brexit. Climate change has been pushed up the agenda in recent months with protests organised by groups including Extinction Rebellion and the international school strikes begun by Sweedish teen Greta Thunberg. Boris Johnsonaposs girlfriend Carrie Symonds, who is a senior adviser for US environmental campaign group Oceana, has urged politicians to act saying they have a gigantic responsibility to care for the environment.  FIVE YEARSapos JAIL FOR ANIMAL ABUSERS . Animal WelfareBill The maximum sentence for animal cruelty offences will be massively ramped up from six months to five years - confirming plans already announced under the Tories. There will also be a clear statement in domestic law that animals are sentient beings, following a controversy some years ago. And there will be a duty on government to have all due regard to the welfare of sentient animals when forming and running new policies. What  is in the Queenaposs Speech  Many measures are in the Queenaposs Speech - or the briefing documents around it - that arenapost spelt out fully in the speech as one of the  Bills. These include: Voter ID crackdown to aposrig the electionapos Boris Johnson has been accused of using Mondayaposs Queen’s Speech as a “blatant” attempt to rig the result of the next election. The Queenaposs Speech paves the way for measures to force voters to show photo ID before being allowed to vote. Hundreds of people were denied their right to vote in last year’s local elections after ministers forced through a pilot scheme, despite warnings it could disenfranchise older voters and people from minority groups. The trial, which was held in eight council areas, resulted in  people being turned away. Yet figures show there were just eight allegations of people lying about who they are at a polling station - known as personation - in . That was down from  in ,  in ,  in  and  in , the Electoral Commission figures show.  A White Paper on mental health There will be a White Paper by the end of this year setting out the governmentaposs response to possible reforms to the Mental Health Act. It comes after pleas for patients not to be detained any more than is absolutely necessary and ensure their views are respected. However there are no immediate plans for a new law in the coming Parliament. Tory pledges on NHS and police The Queenaposs Speech will sit alongside measures already announced to invest in the NHS, strengthen environmental protections and raise living standards through increasing the national living wage to £. an hour by  for over-s. Also mentioned is the pledge to hire , more police officers... which almost but not quite reverses Tory cuts to numbers since . Stopping a repeat of Thomas Cook A new law will attempt to stop a repeat of the Thomas Cook debacle by giving the Civil Aviation Authority oversight over airlines in distress. There arenapost confirmed plans or a set Bill yet. Six other Bills There are six Bills not mentioned by the Queen herself in addition to the . They include allowing the building of part of HS - despite the risk the rail line will be scrapped altogether in a government review. It also involves a Bill to make it easier for NHS hospitals to manufacture and trial medicines and medical devices. Other technical Bills will allow further payments under the Windrush compensation scheme to Brits who arrived from the Caribbean before the s - and technical changes to legal sentencing in the criminal courts. What ISNaposT in the Queenaposs Speech now  A firm plan for social careThe Tories have kicked the can down the road on social care yet again with no plans for the ailing sector contained in the Queenaposs Speech. Despite promising an optimistic and ambitious programme of domestic legislation, the Prime Minister has failed to set out how to tackle the growing crisis. Theresa May  was accused of kicking the can down the road after she repeatedly delayed plans for a ‘green paper’ on social care first planned for summer . Her blighted social care plans in the  general election campaign were dubbed a “dementia tax” and blamed for the Tories losing their majority in the  general election. During the Tory leadership contest,  Boris Johnson  said he had a reform plan ready to go once he arrived in office. But so far there has been no suggestion of what the government would actually do.

She unveiled  new Bills in Parliament, which probably wonapost be made law because Parliament is likely to be dissolved for an election. But that wasnapost the only way she happened to fulfil the PMaposs political dreams. Thereaposs also Brexit. Her Majesty turned heads with the opening words of her speech - because they were all about Brexit. She even explicitly mentioned the exit date of October . Now, itaposs important to note the government - not the Queen - writes the Queenaposs Speech. And on closer inspection her wording definitely wasnapost the gung-ho language of Johnson. But itaposs still a far cry from when she wore a hat resembling an EU flag at the  State Opening of Parliament. So weaposve reproduced what she said, and had a stab at what it might mean.    The Queen opened her speech today by saying the governmentaposs priority has always been to leave the EU on October . My Government’s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on  October. My Government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly cooperation. What does the wording tell us   On the one hand, Boris Johnsonaposs inserted the October  date into the Queenaposs Speech. Some might see that as a provocative statement of intent. But on the other, what did she actually say  It turns out the Queen used much less firm wording on Brexit than everything . The rest of her speech is littered with firm promises in the present or future tense. My government will bring forward. My ministers will ensure. My government remains committed. But not the bit about Brexit. This was placed firmly in the past tense. And it didnapost promise to leave the EU on Halloween - instead saying it has been a priority. What brought on this sudden moderate language  Did the Monarch, weeks after she was politicised to unlawfully shut down Parliament, signal that she didnapost want to be seen to give a view on Brexit  Or did Downing Street act first - keeping the wording gentle to avoid infuriating the Palace  Without a view inside the secretive communications between No and Buckingham Palace, we canapost know for sure. But itaposs certainly interesting that the phrase was worded as it was. Downing Street refused to saythere was a conversation between No and the Palace about the phrase. But a spokesman said: “The language in the Queen’s Speech was the language suggested by the government.”    The last Queenaposs Speech in  didnapost go as far as todayaposs. It didnapost mention an exit date and merely spoke of securing the best possible deal. She also delivered it wearing a hat that resembled the EU flag. My government’s priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union. My ministers are committed to working with Parliament, the devolved administrations, business and others to build the widest possible consensus on the country’s future outside the European Union.

The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition typically walk side-by-side as MPs file from the House of Commons to the House of Lords. The cameras showed Mr Johnson try and make small talk with the Labour leader but Mr Corbyn was having none of it, giving what looked like monosyllabic answers. As he rounded a corner Mr Corbyn seemed to turn to the camera and pull a face which some interpreted as a sign of his opinion of the Tory leader. The General Secretary of the CWU union Dave Ward tweeted the image with the message: Weaposre with you, Jeremy Corbyn .    While Tory councillor Joe Porter tweeted: Jeremy Corbyn looking very worried about facing Boris Johnson in a general election !! But it was later pointed out that one of the cameras filming the spectacle was in the Labour leaderaposs way - and it seemed he was worried about getting past it.

Gemma Dobbing had been so focused on looking after her little boy Charlie, now three, that her diet spiralled out of control and she gorged on Chinese takeaways and chocolate bars. At her heaviest, the council worker weighed st and couldnapost bear to go on nights out with friends because she struggled to find clothes to fit her size  figure. But after booking her wedding in October  and finding the perfect dress, Gemma, , set herself the challenge of squeezing into the gown in less than a year. Two weeks ago she walked down the aisle to audible gasps from relatives who could hardly recognise her.  Gemma, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: Itaposs a massive achievement. I was so happy. When I bought my dream dress, it didnapost even fit. It didnapost close fully. I was a size  and it was size  - but it was the dress of my dreams. My mum said aposyou really shouldnapost do thisapos as I signed a waiver, confirming I was aware it didnapost fit when I bought it. Weaposd been storing the dress at my mother-in-lawaposs house for the last year, but eight weeks ago it went to the dressmaker for alterations. I was convinced it wasnapost going to fit. I panicked. When I put it the dress on it still didnapost fit - but this time it was too big! We had to take four and a half inches off the waist.  I hit my target three days before the wedding on September . I was a size eight and weighed just st lbs. Iaposd finally done it. After being with Alan for seven years, Gemma claims he never commented on her weight, but told her to do what she needed to do to feel good. But as he turned around to see her walking down the aisle, she claims he had a tear in his eye. For family members who lived further afield, it was the first time they had seen Gemma since her weight loss journey began and they gasped at her incredible transformation. Gemma said: A lot of my family live far away and they hadnapost seen me, so when I walked down the aisle you could hear people gasping. It made my day. It was amazing.  Alan had always just said to me to do what I want to do, but when he saw me on our wedding day, he had a tear in his eye and said I looked beautul and like a princess. Gemma had survived on a diet of chocolate and crisps for breakfast, fish and chips with bread for lunch and takeaways for dinner. And after a letime suffering with acute asthma, she realised her weight was making the condition worse - with medics even telling her to lose weight. The last straw came when Gemma looked at pictures of her little boyaposs birthday party and didnapost recognise herself. Gemma said: Friends would invite me on nights out and initially I would say yes, but then on the day I would change my mind. I didnapost have any clothes to fit me. I would just wear a baggy t-shirt or leggings. I suddenly didnapost like to go out.  I stopped going out and being myself because of my weight. I was already in ill health, including lung disease and acute asthma, and Iaposd been in critical care in hospital  times in a year. Iaposve always had bad lungs, but I think they struggled supporting me more when I was overweight. The respiratory nurses said I needed to lose weight, but I would think aposwho are they telling me to lose weight apos I had a party for my sonaposs second birthday in August last year, at Build a Bear Factory.I saw a photo of myself on Facebook with Charlie on my hip and I thought aposoh my god, is that really me aposBy that point, I felt ashamed of myself. I didnapost know how I could have let myself get like that. Just over a week later I joined Slimming World. Iaposve only been a member for just over a year. Iaposll never be cured of the asthma or lung disease, but I feel I can breathe more freely now.  After a month of following the plan religiously, the plus-size mum had already lost half a stone. She swapped last minute morning sugar for overnight oats with berries and her fatty chip suppers were swapped for healthy wraps or chicken and rice. Gemma said: I went to the first meeting and was like aposoh my god, how do I walk through that door myself apos But everyone was so supportive. Itaposs tough to keep going. I got bored of the same meals because I wasnapost mixing up the recipes and by December, I almost quit. My friend Bex joined too to give me motivation and I learnt to cook from fresh. There were points where my weight plateaued. I was trying so hard but for a few weeks I wouldnapost lose anything.

Yesterday evening six million people tuned in to witness a live stream event of video game Fortnite - marking the end of Season . The romping shoot-em-up took an unlikely turn when a cut scene of its usually bright island of upbeat characters was sucked into a blackhole. Since the last shreds of light disappeared into the abyss, the immensely popular online game has been out of action for the millions of Fortnite devotees. One such fan is Maxx Honhold, whose mum Emma Broughton recorded a video of him watching the virtual world disintergrate.    The clip shows the seven-year-old wearing a set of alien spacecraft pyjamas and hopping around excitedly as the clip begins on the family television. Itaposs going out, Maxx exclaims, clasping his hands to his head as an eerie dusk falls over Fortnite land. Oh my god! The excitement is momentarily matched by Maxxaposs dad Tristian, who gasps as one of the characters is blasted away from the ground. While the gun toting figure rises up and up the young boyaposs excitement muffles his words.    As the island finally recedes into a tiny speck of light Maxx exclaims: Itaposs the end of Fortnite. Mum Emma explained how much Maxx enjoys playing the game. He absolutely loves Fortnite and plays it with his friends once heaposs done his homework every evening, the Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex woman said.  He probably plays one hour each evening - as long as heaposs good. Watching his favourite game turn to black came as a bit of a shock to Maxx, who has a three-year-old brother Louie.    Emma added: Once the game wouldnapost turn back on he genuinely thought it was the end of the game forever. He still keeps making me check online every so often for updates I wouldnapost say heaposs sad, not yet anyway. He knows it will be back soon. I donapost think anything could make him upset, heaposs such a happy child. Unlike Maxx a lot of children have been upset by the Fortnite shutdown.

Following a two-day trial, the judge ruled that Ms Ralphs was to be evicted from the property and said she could not appeal against the decision. The -year-old, who describes herself as a bit of a hoarder, said she has lived at the property for four years. She claimed her hoarding problem started as she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and had what she describes as a tough upbringing.Mostly itaposs because I moved here from a place that had five bedrooms, so I have lots of bags of clothes, bedding and curtains, but I am very hygienic, she told North Wales Live .   Ms Ralphs, of Blaenau Ffestiniog, Wales, briefly barricaded her home before letting in the bailfs. Three police officers also turned up and the locks were changed. The woman said: “I’m staying positive mentally. Though fragile I’m not going to be angry or bitter. “I’m getting in touch with my MP Liz Saville Roberts for some advice.    “I don’t want to be re-housed, just to regain the home I’ve enjoyed for the last four years with my three lovely cats. “I’m , a retired professional and I’d like some respect for my dignity and sanity. I had a sleepless night hoping for a last minute change of mind.” Before being evicted she declared: ”I feel like a donkey dragged  miles through the Sahara then being kicked and punched instead of being able to reach the oasis for water. I’m so happy here with my cats and their feline friends. My neighbours are animal lovers, too.  “I’m a quiet and submissive spinster just getting over a run of bad luck. I don’t smoke, drink or take drugs – but the system has walked out on me. No one is helping me.” One bystander said: “It’s all very sad.” MP Liz Saville Roberts said: “I will do everything I can to help her. No one wants to see a -year-old in the street.

She had brought her gorgeous baby boy Ellis into bed with her during the night to feed him, so she reached out for him. When I woke up I knew something wasnapost right. I put my hand on his head and he was cold. She went into autopilot, shouting for her husband to call and ambulance and doing mouth-to-mouth. I just thought I need to make him breathe. I was trying to remember all the things I learnt in Girl Guides as a child. But I couldnapost make him breathe and it was really frustrating. I suspect that he had probably been dead a while so I was never going to make him breathe.    Itaposs a very strange feeling knowing that youaposre trying to bring somebody back to le and theyaposre just not coming back. Ellis was just four days old when he died. Speaking toto mark Baby Loss Awareness Week, Louise speaks about the devastating hours and days that followed after her baby boy died suddenly from SIDS. Ellis, Louiseaposs first child with husband Jim, was born on Wednesday,  February . The couple, who live in East Yorkshire, were just getting used to their new lives as parents when they were hit by the worst possible tragedy. When the paramedics arrived they took him straight to hospital with Louise and Sam following behind in the car. I think they knew he was dead and there was nothing they could do.  Itaposs quite possible they were trying to do stuff they didnapost want us to see, Iaposm quite glad I didnapost go in the ambulance. When they got to the hospital they were taken straight to the family room. You see that on the telly. When they take people to the family room itaposs never good news. The doctoraposs face said the whole thing. I looked at him and said aposheaposs dead, isnapost heapos and he nodded. The rest of the day is a blur. They brought him through so we could see him. They were given the opportunity to spend some time with Ellis and invited members of their family, some who were yet to meet him at all, to say goodbye. It was quite surreal. It is the odd bits about it that you remember. The nurse was called Julie, Iaposve never forgotten that. She said she was going to look after him when we werenapost there. She made it right for us. She made sure she was in the room when we got there.  She was just so kind. He looked perfect but he wasnapost crying of moving. Itaposs something you wouldnapost wish on anybody. He just looked so perfect and thataposs what I will always remember. I just thought how can this be happening to us. What had I done  Some family members hadnapost met him yet. Those who hadnapost met him had their first cuddle. The first time my husbandaposs sister met him he had died. Some people didnapost want to cuddle him, itaposs very dferent cuddling a dead baby because it feels all wrong. I think everybody was exhausted by the emotion of the day. While they were at the hospital their home had been turned into a crime scene as police to check there hadnapost been any suspicious circumstances around the death. Officers also took away Ellisaposs clothes, nappies and their bedding. Youaposve just lost your child, itaposs like have a bit of respect, but they were just doing their job. Still in shock, the couple ed home without their little boy. We watched the wrestling of all things. It was a bizarre evening. What do you do   Youaposre supposed to have a baby to look after.  As Louise had been breastfeeding she still had to express her milk, which she found extremely dficult. Your body knows youaposve had a baby but it doesnapost know that baby isnapost there anymore so it still reacts. For weeks I could still hear a baby crying when there were no babies around. Youaposre supposed to have a baby for everyone to coo over. The staff at the hospital were amazing. Throughout the whole day people were amazing. Everyone tries to do the best for you. The police officers kept in touch every day, even on their days off. A full postmortem was carried out, including tests to seeEllis had suffocated from being in bed with his parents, but found nothing suspicious. Itaposs hard knowing your baby is having a postmortem done. I found that very hard to deal with. I found it very hard to contend with that it could have been my fault. They were told Ellis had died from SIDs and were given his death certicate. There was a relief that it wasnapost suffocation, but what does SIDs mean  It doesnapost mean anything. No one can give you any reason as to why he died. You donapost know why your child died. For me thataposs not good enough. There was no reason as to why he died.apos The results meant they could start planning the funeral.  It was the best funeral Iaposve ever been to, which is a weird thing to say. People came for me and Jim. It was lovely to see so many people. People were coming back together. He was still putting some good into the world. Both Louise and Jim decided to go back to work the day after the funeral in a bid to get some normality back in their lives. I just felt going back to work would give me something to focus on. Youaposre just sitting at home without a baby on maternity leave. You canapost go to mother and baby groups, all the other people you met at maternity groups are meeting up and sharing their babies. I didnapost want to meet up with them, I didnapost want to see them with their babies. I needed to go back. I needed to not be at home dwelling on things. Itaposs the kind of thing that you never get over but you learn to live with it. It never goes away. You have reminders every now and again. Three or four years later there was a cot death on Eastenders, itaposs those sort of things that set you back. Those are the things you canapost prepare for. Anniversaries and Christmas you know are coming. A year after losing Ellis, Louise and Jim welcomed baby Alex. When we found out we were pregnant we just thought aposoh my God whataposs going to happen, here we go againapos.

The -year-old White had been out looking for his teenage daughter when the tragedy happened at a pedestrian crossing, Liverpool Echo reports. Kate escaped with a broken foot, but Charlotte was propelled into the air and died immediately from multiple injuries. The two friends, Charlotte and Kate, had been on a night out in the town centre with their respective boyfriends, Rhys West and Connor Jones. They were on their way to a bar when the collision took place. White, from Bidston, was jailed for four and a half years at Liverpool Crown Court today after admitting causing Charlotteaposs death by dangerous driving.  He is due to be automatically released from prison, subject to licence conditions, half way through that sentence. Judge Louise Brandon, sentencing, described him as cowardly, selfish and irresponsible, after it emerged he carried on driving, before parking his Honda Civic in a dark street and phoning the police to say he was too scared to go back to the scene. During the hearing, a set of statements were read to the court by prosecutor Chris Hopkins. Rhys, who met Charlotte at high school, said: She was the love of my le. I wanted to marry this girl and spend the rest of my le with her but I can’t now. That night has changed my le forever. I saw my girlfriend killed. I ran over to her and held her. I wrapped her in my hoody, I knew she was gone when I saw her eyes. One of her eyes looked like a sunflower and that sunflower was gone.    He described being driven to Arrowe Park Hospital by a bouncer who had witnessed the crash. He said: I sat with Charl for a long time, just looking at her, trying to work out what was happening, willing her to just wake up and tell me she loved me one last time. She looked just as beautul as the first day I met her at school. She had always told everyone that she would be with me and she did. She will always have my heart.... She made me feel like I could do anything and be anything, she was the most loyal, beautul, caring person in the world who made me the happiest person ever. I am nothing without her, I feel nothing without her. The second she died I died with her. Mr Hopkins also read a statement from Charlotteaposs mum, Helen Martin, who described the hospital room as filled with deepest sorrow. She said: In one moment my family as I knew and cherished it was obliterated, my beautul daughter, my best friend, gone. I long for her to come home to see her smile, to sit and chat about everything as we did. I miss her singing and dancing around, I miss what is her. A statement from Kate, who said she had known Charlotte since the age of , said she was the happiest, bubbliest person you could meet.  She said: No one at the age of  ever expects to go out with their best friend and for one of them not tohome the same night. It’s been a very hard struggle. I try to just stay as busy as possible and not think about it. It just doesn’t seem to get easier without her. I can be walking home from work or even just lying in bed and the night just replays in my head over and over, asking what s constantly. Mr Hopkins told the court White had been seen by several witnesses driving at high speeds on Conway Street. He said: Rhys West confirms that he was a short distance behind the girls at the crossing. He was concentrating on checking for traffic to his right when he heard an almighty bang and immediately focused his attention towards where the girls were crossing. He estimates that the defendant’s vehicle was travelling at motorway speeds, around mph. As he crossed the road he saw his girlfriend four to five car s up Conway Street. He screamed her name but got no response. It was later at hospital that he was told that she had died... The defendant then continued to drive to the end of Conway Street. He did not stop. With his windscreen smashed and intruding into his car, damage to the bonnet and light cluster and a headlight out, he turned left at the roundabout onto Argyle Street. Mr Hopkins said the CCTV footage revealed the driveraposs speed at the time of the collision was .mph, despite his claims that he had been travelling at ish miles an hour and the girls had stepped out in front of him.

At the time, Louise , from Waterhouses, in Staffordshire, didn’t think much of the unusual flavour of wine she had enjoyed after a family day out. But later that night, Louise, who was  at the time, awoke in the night with chest pains and was blue-lighted to hospital. The first sign that something wasn’t right was when I had a glass of wine and it tasted really funny, she said. My husband tried some too and said it was fine, so I didn’t think much of it. “That night, I woke up just after midnight with excruciating pain and pressure in my chest. At first I thought it might be indigestion but I quickly realised that something wasn’t right and my husband called an ambulance. When the paramedics arrived they said they thought I was having a heart attack. I looked at my husband and just started sobbing.    I guess I was in shock and my first thought was that I was going to die.”Louise had a stent fitted into her left coronary artery at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, Chronicle Live reports.She added: “As soon as the stent was put in place I immediately began to feel better. I couldn’t believe it was that quick. The surgeon said there is a second blockage in my other artery, but it’s not big enough to need a stent.” Now the mum of twin daughters is campaigning for women to look after their heart health from a young age - as she worries too often heart attacks are assumed to impact only men. The British Heart Foundation has launched a new briefing, revealing the inequalities in awareness, diagnosis and treatment of heart attacks killing women in the UK. In the North East alone, around , women are admitted to hospital following a heart attack each year, the BHF says. The charity estimates that around , women in the North East, like Louise, have survived a heart attack. The BHF says its new research shows women often delay seeking medical help by more than two hours, reducing their chance of survival. Speaking about the brewing symptoms, Louise, said: “Looking back at the week before I was really tired and working long hours and juggling le with the kids. Two nights after I got back from work I literally fell asleep on the sofa, which was really unusual for me. I thought I’d just hit a wall because of being a busy working mum – which I realise now is a typical female response. I had extreme tiredness before mine, but thought it was just because I was busy.” Now Louise is more conscious of how and what she eats. She has also been proactive in creating a healthier work-le balance by not overworking or committing to long hours. In a bid to educate her daughters, Louise confides in them about the reason they are going for a walk or doing sport. Worryingly, according to the BHF briefing, more than , women in England and Wales alone died over a -year period because they did not receive equal treatment to men.

Stuart said at the time: “Sizing players up on the field is a far cry from doing the same job on the bench.“It will probably take me time to adjust to my new job.“After  years as a full-time player, I will find things a bit strange as a part-time manager.“However, I really believe I can do something for the club.“One of my first tasks will be to set up an effective scouting system.“I am sure players from the east coast are potentially better and Edinburgh, in particular, is breeding some fine ones.“It is my aim to have a working knowledge of the entire area.”After six years at Links Park, he succeeded Ally McLeod at Ayr United after he took the Scotland job.He then had a spell with St Johnstone.Below is from February , #Alec Stuart, the Montrose manager, knows the value of being prepared.He signed trialist centre-forward Alan Simpson, of Alyth United JFC, on the coach coming home from Stirling, whipping out a provisional form from the moment the -year-old office worker agreed to turn senior.Arbroath had two representatives at the Stirling Albion game, while Raith had also offered Simpson terms.However, the Montrose manager tackled the player before he had changed, was told he would like  hours to think it over, and then had another talk with him on the coach.Simpson, a first-season junior, was with the same juvenile team as Les Barr, who made his comeback after injury.He will play against Forfar this week and will be given another run the following weekend.If he shapes up well, he will be called up after these games."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46925713-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46925713-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46925713-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46925713-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"blether fans flock to see the jim mclean years","story":"Several weeks ago, this column highlighted a wonderful initiative currently going on at Tannadice Park – and it helped bring the crowds in to see it.In one of the lounges is a display as Dundee United remembers the glory years under their greatest-ever manager.Tom Cairns, chairman of the Dundee United Business Club, along with several other volunteers, host the ‘The United in Memories’ display at the ground.Said Tom: “Many thanks for your promotion in BwB of the display.“It certainly had the desired effect as we were overwhelmed on the Wednesday after it was in your column.“Your help is appreciated.”It can still be viewed every Wednesday until late November.On display is an array of interesting memorabilia encompassing the managerial career of the most successful manager in Dundee United history.As I said before, this has got to be a must-see event for every United fan – and, indeed, every football fan.Admission is free via the main door at Tannadice Park from pm until .pm and has easy disabled persons access.Scott Coupar, replying on social media, said: “No matter what you think of him,it wasn’t for Jim Dundee United would still be the wee team in Dundee.“No trophies, no European adventures.“I met the man on several occasions and he was a gentleman.

You don’t like to change your centre-backs.“He has worked away and has probably trained for a longer period of time than he has here for a while.“That’s the big thing. Get him training consistently then you can see the benefit.“In the second half last Saturday he was excellent, both centre-halfs were. They were really dominant and in control and never looked in any pressure in the second half.”Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer hopes Declan McDaid’s double last week against the Red Lichties can give the former Ayr winger the “belief” to push on and add the goals he is capable of.“Declan has been great,” James added. “We’ve all given him a bit about not scoring because he’s great in training.“He’s positive, scores goals and takes people on. If you got our squad to pick three players that have to start every game I think most of them would pick Declan.“Going backwards for a forward player is great for the team defensively and he deserved those goals against Arbroath because they have been coming.“It’s about belief with him because he can be a match-winner and we need that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19531345-Scotland-v-San-Marino_33083184-760x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds super shankland hailed by fans as he scores in first scotland start","story":"Dundee United scoring sensation Lawrence Shankland has been hailed by football fans after scoring on his Scotland home debut.The Tannadice striker knocked in Scotland’s fourth goal at Hampden Park last night in a -

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

The group, the Mull of Kintyre Milk Supply Cooperative, will fund the purchase through use of a levy from every litre of milk produced, in addition to external funding which is currently being sought.A key element of the funding is the launch of the crowdfunding campaign which seeks to raise £, towards the purchase. The group is encouraging the local community, foodies, suppliers, customers, businesses and anyone with a love of cheese to contribute and further information can be found at www.crowdfunder mokcheddarIn  First Milk, a British farmer-owned dairy co-operative, announced plans to sell Campbeltown Creamery as part of a move away from smaller-scale brands.

We are very lucky that the Oban Distillery is a wonderful resource in our town and a very popular one. This could really affect business for the Oban Distillery.#However, Mr MacKay#s concern did not end with Oban. He added: #For Argyll and the Isles, whisky is a vital, vital part of the economy. The distilleries are phenomenal. Is it a matter of time until they start doing the same with the likes of gin, which has had a boost in the last few years, with nearly every island having its own gin  It could have some long-term effects.#Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: #This is a blow to the Scotch whisky industry. The tarf will undoubtedly damage the Scotch whisky sector. The US is our largest and most valuable single market.#The tarf will put our competitiveness and Scotch whisky’s market share at risk. We are also concerned that it will disproportionately impact smaller producers. We expect to see a negative impact on investment and job creation in Scotland, and longer term impacts on productivity and growth across the industry and our supply chain.#"},{"url":null,"title":"the unstoppable march of progress","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s edition sees the very welcomeof our artistic contributor Ann Thomas from Tarbert.The subject for Ann#s musings is the proposal by Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks to erect new, taller pylons across the neck of land between East and West loch Tarbert as part of a much larger project to upgrade the power transmission network between Inveraray and the north east Kintyre coast near Skipness.Many local people oppose the plan for pylons close to Tarbert which, they say, will ruin the village#s scenic beauty at a stroke."},{"url":null,"title":"47-year-old-cleared-breaching-alcohol-limit-charge","story":"A JEDBURGH man accused of being in charge of a car while more than five times the legal alcohol limit has been found not guilty at the towns sherf court.Christopher Smethurst, , of Brucefield House, Rennieston, had denied the offence which was said to have happened in High Street, Jedburgh, on June .It was alleged he had a breath alcohol reading of  microgrammes - the legal limit being .But he was found not guilty by Sherf Colin Dunipace following a trial."},{"url":null,"title":"roll-roll-biggar-little-fest-back-town","story":"TICKETS are now ready to buy from the Biggar Box Office ready for Little Festival in two weeks time.The annual festival is hailed as one of the biggest, best and most popular events in Scotland.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

needle discoveries only underscores the evident need for the introduction of safe consumption spaces, where professionals can offer in-house health advice directly to addicts, without fear of prosecution, and used needles can be easily and safely disposed of. \"Until such times, it is worth reminding the community again that Bankton Pharmacy currently offers a needle exchange facility where users and their friends, family or carers can exchange and dispose of needles safely.The needles can be collected by East Lothian Council, which has a -hour service that can be reached on  .A

His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces.

Theyrsquore not hillwalking and outside types.ldquoThey are people who donrsquot want to spend pound or pound to use a campsite. And when someone challenges them ndash such as someone I know who asked a family to pick up dirty nappies they had left behind on a beach ndash they are met with aggression.ldquoAnd it doesnrsquot matter how many Countryside Code leaflets you print out, they are not reading them. I donrsquot want to impinge on anyonersquos rights to roam, I want to stop people having the right to make a mess.The petition says the impact of wild camping, particularly on the NC route, has been ldquoconsiderable and adds it has become ldquoexceptionally problematic for local authorities and public bodies to deal with and at great expense to the public purse.:Herald Entrepreneur: Hone your vision so you have a strong foundation from which to build your businessIt points out that the problem isnrsquot restricted to the areas which line the NC route, with complaints about the impact of wild campers emerging from the Western Isles and other Scottish tourist hotspots across the country.In it, Currie adds: ldquoInformal encouragement has not been sufficient to stop the degradation of our infrastructure and environment.ldquoEven with an increased focus on responsible camping from public authorities and the NC organisation, the situation appears to be getting worse rather than better.ldquoThe route of the NC is becoming totally unsuitable for small rural communities in the north of Scotland.The NC tourist trail has been credited with transforming tourism to Scotlandrsquos northwest coast since its launch in .Most travellers opt to start at Inverness and take in a -mile loop around the northern tip of the mainland, before eventually ing to the Highland capital.Part of its charm is the long distances travellers can cover without encountering the distractions of modern le, around one-fth of it on narrow, single-track roads.With accommodation limited to small BBs, inns and hotels, many visitors opt to travel the route in campervans or with tents for camping under the stars.But while the route is said to have added at least pound million to the regionrsquos economy and brought over , visitors, people living in the area have become increasingly outspoken over the impact of tourism on their fragile environment.Wild camping is legal in Scotland. However, campers are expected to stick to the Scottish Outdoor Access Code which suggests it should involve camping for just two or three nights at a time and be ldquolightweight, with small numbers of people and no trace left on the natural surroundings.According to the Holyrood petition, no camping zones would allow local authorities to encourage responsible tourism and encourage campers to use campsites and their facilities to dispose of waste properly.It could see camping banned at increasingly popular wild camping sites near cities in areas such as Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire, Fe, East Lothian and Aberdeenshire.The petition does not set out to ban wild camping entirely, just from areas close to roadsides which are becoming overwhelmed with campers.Wild camping has already been outlawed around parts of Loch Lomond.But there are concerns about how stringently councils will impose the no camping rules which could affect mountaineers and walkers who want to pitch a tent during overnight expeditions.Responses to the online petition have included comments which support the call and highlight inidual problem areas. One claims that campervans park within  metres of a campsite in Tongue rather than use its facilities, while another said simply: ldquoDone seeing bins overflowing in the middle of nowhere and people having a lsquonumber tworsquo outside their camping site.Another wrote: ldquoHaving visited the south side of Loch Tummel for nearly  years it has been devastating to witness the rubbish people leave behind when wild camping.ldquoSome of my favourite walking spots are now no-go areas due to human waste and view spots are ruined by rubbish.Others, however, spoke out against the idea of legislation with one commenting: ldquoEroding the rights of all citizens is not the answer.Another said: ldquoImposing complete bans totally ruins it for those acting responsibly and goes against everything the current outdoor access code stands for.Helen Todd, Ramblers Scotlandrsquos campaigns and policy manager, said: ldquoSadly there are ongoing issues in hotspot areas with an antisocial minority who are damaging the environment, the reputation of campers and the outdoor experience for everyone who loves our countryside.ldquoThe entire outdoor community shares the frustration of residents about these people, whose selfish actions impact upon communities, landscapes and the thousands of responsible people who enjoy camping away from formal sites across Scotland.ldquoWe are calling for antisocial camping to be tackled through stronger enforcement of the existing laws, provision of facilities and more low-cost campsites, and investment in education on responsible access ndash rather than new costly and ineffective laws or by-laws, which themselves would need enforced.ldquoIn many instances, responsible roadside camping away from houses is legal, legitimate and simply the best option.ldquoFor example, winter climbers arriving late ahead of a pre-dawn start, cycle tourers, disabled campers who benefit from being near their car, canoeists and anglers at road-circled lochs and long-distance walkers.She added: ldquoRather than banning campers, the best solution is to try out ious visitor management measures, such as investment in infrastructure like low-cost campsites, toilets and litter bins, and lots of education. This should be monitored and adjusted as time goes on to find out what works best.ldquoIn addition, enforcement of existing legislation like breach of the peace, vandalism and littering can be carried out by the police in areas known to be hotspots.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone involved with setting up NC expected it to be as spectacular a success story in terms of numbers, but the infrastructure is not there. They put the cart before the horse. A lot of public money was spent marketing this route but there was a failure to provide an effective infrastructure for anyone using it.A spokesman for North Coast  said: ldquoLitter is a problem associated with most human activities and it should be recognised that residents are as likely to be responsible as visitors for negligent waste disposal. We encourage all visitors to the North Coast  to travel with respect for the environment. We share top tips on our website and social media channels in order to reach as many people as possible, including visitors and locals.ldquoThis information includes content on anti-litter campaigns, details of campsites around the NC route, and advice on how visitors should dispose of their motorhome waste in the correct manner. We work with organisations such as Keep Scotland Beautul to educate and encourage responsible and sustainable litter disposal along the route."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Sturgeon is spot on   MPs should bin Boris and his dodgy deal","story":"ldquoIf you donrsquot give us what we want wersquoll be very, very naughty! screamed the memo, which outlined the ways in which the UK would seek to punish EU states that agreed to give the UK an extension, should a deal not be reached by October .

We looked at a wide range of things ndash infrastructure, communities, housing being some examples.ldquoWe realised very quickly that the biggest problem facing the island was housing and it had to be fixed before everything . Therersquos simply just not enough housing for people who are working normal jobs and we are talking about the whole spectrum of things you need for a community ndash from doctors and teachers to care workers and cleaners.At  per cent Arran has one of the highest rates of housing used for holiday or second homes in the UK, second only to St Ives in Cornwall, where one-quarter of properties are holiday homes.The average house price is pound,, while the average wage is only pound,. The AEG estimates that earnings of pound, are required to get on the housing ladder.A study carried out by the group warns that the lack of housing for workers will have serious impacts on the islandrsquos population as time goes on, with  jobs being lost due to lack of affordable accommodation each year with a pound.m loss to the local economy.After  years,things remain as they are, the employment impacts are expected to have risen to  jobs lost and a pound.m shortfall per annum.Ms Borthwick added: ldquoThere are job vacancies right across the island we canrsquot fill because therersquos nowhere for them to stay. What we want to do is build houses that people want to live in. North Ayrshire Council ndash the local authority for Arran ndash is also building new homes on the island to try to alleviate the problem.Councillor Jim Montgomerie, Cabinet Member for Place, said the signicant growth in the short-term lets market was causing particular problems.He added: ldquoWe know that second homes have an inflationary effect on housing markets, and this effect has been magnied on Arran where increasing access to affordable housing is particularly challenging because of land availability, land values, and high construction costs. We are preparing to begin construction of  new council homes on the island and while this new development wonrsquot eliminate the problem, it will be an important step towards addressing the issue."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-dissidents-keep-faith-leader","story":"One thing we can be certain of is that the vote to leave the EU fundamentally changed our expectations and perceptions of politicians. We both revere and vily them as never before.In using legal prowess to cut a path through the arcane procedures of the House of Commons, Dominic Grieve and Joanna Cherry have emerged as unlikely heroes ndash or baddies, depending on your perspective. A recent poll for Sky News showed that only one in seven people trust Parliament on Brexit.That lack of trust cannot be separated from the widespread perception that the public are not being told the full story ndash or even the synopsis ndash from those in power. As ldquoDowning Street sourcesrsquorsquo release briefing and counter-briefing ndash often contrary to Government policy ndash the effect is a dizzying upending of reality.Will they do what they say they will, and do they even want to As we pin our hopes on the wisdom of our elected representatives while also doubting their intentions, the cracks in the pillars of our democracy worsen.It looks a lot like the rules have changed, and that the conventions that previously governed the honesty of politics have been gradually eroded.One politician who has emerged relatively unscathed from the Brexit process thus far is Nicola Sturgeon. Ironically, her greatest political challenges at present come not from the electorate, but from critics within her own party.There is internal stre over her approach to a second independence referendum, tensions which have been exasperated with every juddering lurch of the Brexit crisis. The constant ticking of the countdown clock, as we have edged nearer to each deadline in the Article  process, has ramped up the disgruntlement and impatience within the SNP.As Ms Sturgeon took to the airwaves for a mammoth media round on the second day of SNP conference on Monday, she set out her short and long-term priorities on Brexit and independence.She wants to see Boris Johnson fulfil the obligations placed upon him by the Benn Act to request a three-month extensionParliament hasnrsquot passed his deal ndash or given its support for no-deal ndash by October . It is her hope that the opposition parties will manage to get their act together and that a General Election will follow soon after.She also confirmed that indyref will be ldquofront and centrersquorsquo in the SNPrsquos campaign in the upcoming General Election. With the SNP projected to win the most seats in Scotland, she hopes the momentum is with her party to negotiate over holding another vote.Her strategy relies on Labour forming a minority government with the support of opposition parties. The price of the SNPrsquos support will be for prime minister Jeremy Corbyn to grant a Section  order so a referendum can be held.However, there is a widespread expectation that any such request would be refused, either by an emboldened Mr Johnson ed as prime minister with a majority ndash or a witless Mr Corbyn who refuses to give ground to earn the SNPrsquos support. If that scenario materialises, the undercurrent of party dissent could threaten to burst its banks.A ldquoPlan B to counteract this, supported by SNP councillor Chris McEleny and others, would see a pro-independence majority at the next election being taken as a mandate to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK government.Ms Sturgeon holds no truck for this muddy proposal, or indeed any deviation from the ldquogold-standardrsquorsquo route to independence that was pursued in . In one interview recently she pointed out that the Westminster voting system makes it possible for the SNP to win the most seats in Scotland, but on a minority of votes. In an age of relentless spin and endless loophole-searching to rig the system, her candour was refreshing.Lets not forget the catalyst for the runaway train of crisis we have seen since  was a leader ndash in David Cameron ndash who bowed to pressure from a minority in his party to seek an answer to a question that, at the time, very few were asking.It is easy to see why the naturally-cautious Ms Sturgeon would want to avoid the legal and constitutional headache that Plan B would bring.She believes that the knee-jerk refusal from Unionist parties to allow a second independence referendum is untenable and that it would be a democratic outrage for Westminster parties of any colour to deny Scotland the right to have a say on its future. While compelling, this argument does rely heavily on the politics of yesteryear: where manesto commitments and election victories meant something, and political reality had an impact on events. In the Brexit Britain of today, it is unlikely that a desire to be ndash or be seen to be ndash fair and reasonable will be enough to compel Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn to concede to the SNPrsquos demands.But Ms Sturgeon is an experienced political operator and it is inconceivable that she will not have planned for that eventuality. Perhaps too quietly for some, perhaps in too guarded a manner to quell the disquiet from her party, but she will have planned nonetheless.Given that, it would have been wise of her critics to wait at least until that key moment before declaring that they had lost faith in her ability to secure a second referendum.If some in the SNP got their way, theyrsquod have her abandon moderation and diplomacy during the Brexit crisis. After all, Mr Johnson fights dirty, so why shouldnrsquot she Some may see her unwillingness to play the game under the new, gloves-off, Brexit rules as weakness. Others now question whether she really wants independence at all. In doing so they undermine one of their partyrsquos greatest assets ndash a leader who hasnrsquot lost a sense of perspective and public duty.You get the sense that a chunk of SNP supporters long for the bombastic days of Alex Salmond, believing that in the current political climate, bullishness and bul***t is power. They should be careful what they wish for.When the time comes for Scotland to decide its future, voters will be asked to put their trust in the arguments made by politicians. Having a leader who still plays by the rules and isnrsquot prone to party-political flights of fancy will be an asset for the campaign.For that reason, Mr Sturgeonrsquos critics should be wary of deciding that their captain is a dud or declaring the game over before it has even begun.Read more: Johnson again dismisses Sturgeons attempt to hold second independence referendum"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-danny-bouyant","story":"STRANGE entities have been glimpsed in a Glasgow city centre store.

No thanks.Why find space in onersquos busy schedule for hard labour when for a mere pound. you can have five men clean your car til its glinting Well, becauseit seems too good to be true then itrsquos likely to be too good to be true.More likely, a pound. car wash means those five people are being exploited as cheap labour. Possibly they are victims of modern slavery, perhaps they have been trafficked.But, given the proleration of hand car washes and the queues at them daily - and nightly, many of the car washes are open long hours - this fact is obviously easy enough for people to turn a blind eye to.Itrsquos interesting that modern day slavery has entered the public consciousness with regards to the clothing industry. We know quite well that our cheap clothes - the pound. swimsuit, the pound pair of jeans - come at a price that is far from economic. There is shock when big name, reputable brands are found to be churning out clothes in factories where workers are paid p an hour to toil in squalid conditions.Boycott, comes the cry.Just yesterday an exposeacute in thenewspaper alleged that workers in a factory making clothing for the high end active wear brand Lululemon are being subjected to cruel treatment - beatings, verbal abuse and pressure to work overtime. They are paid, it is claimed, around pound a month, which is less than the cost of one pair of Lululemon leggings.The company has said it will launch an immediate investigation, no doubt acting swtly and sharply because it knows the gross ill treatment of Bangladeshi female factory workers will play extremely badly with its middle class, socially aware customer base. Will boycott become the cry for Lululemon Yet when poor working conditions exist on our doorstep, we somehow find it easier to overlook.Nail bars are another consumer convenience where modern day slavery prolerates. They satisfy the desire for a bargain, make you feel good and therersquos no inconvenience of having to book ahead for an appointment. In the current financial climate, women have less money to spend on beauty treats and so something like a regular manicure is an addictive temptation for some.But is it ethical to continue to go to a nail baryou believe you may be participating in exploitation  Itrsquos easy for me to ask: the one and only time Irsquove set foot in a nail bar was accompanying a Police Scotland operation on human trafficking. If I was a woman keen on regular manicures and pedicures, would I be, as with the car washes, uncomfortable but still settling down for a file and polish The restructuring of how we shop has created an environment in which it is easy for exploitation to go unchecked. As with nail bars satisfying the need for a quick, cheap treatment, petrol stations are under pressure as consumers find it more convenient to fill up at supermarket petrol pumps rather than make two journeys to two locations.This means a decrease in the number of mechanical car washes and an increase in vacant space to be taken over by... exploitative hand car washes. Which is not to say that all car washes are exploitative. The UK body the Car Wash Advisory Service has an accreditation scheme, WashMark, that drivers can look out for.Drivers and nail bar customers can also easily look out for the signs of exploitation: workers who canrsquot communicate with customers in English, where the staff appear withdrawn or very young, where they are living in houses of multiple occupancy.A high profile court case last week saw four members of a gang found guilty of trafficking young Roma women and girls from Slovakia to Govanhill, to flats just a couple of streets away from where I live. One of the young women was sold into a sham marriage for pound, outside a branch of Primark in Glasgow city centre. The story captured readers in high numbers, likely from the shock of having such a heinous crime against such a familiar background.Yet exploitation is happening all around us and it needs consumers to be alert to the issue in order to tackle it.The Scottish Government commissioned a public survey this year on public responses to human trafficking. It found that respondents saw the crime as less of an issue in Scotland than overseas. In ,  per cent of people saw modern slavery as an issue in Scotland, falling to  per cent this year.People were far more likely to believe modern slavery to be an issue in Europe and the rest of the world - showing an awareness of the subject but a belief that it doesnrsquot happen here. Some  per cent of respondents admitted to a low level of understanding of human trafficking.At an event a few years ago I was chatting to a chap who said he owned a handful of car washes at dferent locations in the west of Scotland. He was quite confident in the ethics of his working practice, saying all his staff earned pound for a  hour day and were given a hot meal at lunchtime.The justication he gave to me was the men he employed would otherwise be out of work. With little English, no qualications and no support networks in Scotland, they would be destitute. He saw exploitation as, in fact, a gt to his staff, a generous springboard into a better le.That was the last time I visited the hand car wash. Exploiting fellow human beings for the sake of enjoying cheap little luxuries  Therersquos no excuse.As consumers we must use our economic power for good."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-scottish-independence-inevitable-not-sure","story":"Party conferences tend to be dismal affairs for those like me with an impartial disposition. They are the times when the worst instincts of politicians go untempered. Conferences are open season on opponents, where no language or accusation goes too far. For that reason, it may be easy to dismiss the use of the word lsquoinevitablersquo.But I wouldnrsquot. Its users may very well be correct. Sentiment towards independence in Scotland has ticked up, albeit gradually, since the first referendum in . There have been occasional spikes, such as the Brexit referendum and Boris Johnsonrsquos ascension to Downing Street, where Yes has taken a lead, before settling, but the trend has been a tick, tick, tick, from , to , to , to , to  and, on Sunday, to .There are some obvious drivers of this. Brexit cannot be expected to land well in a country in which  per cent of people voted to Remain. A decade of Tory government will inevitably take its toll in a country where the Tories are back down to polling numbers in the low  per cent region.And, most importantly of all for the long-term prospects of the independence movement, the wind of demographic change is very much with them. Bluntly, more newly minted -year-old voters vote yes, and more dying voters vote no.So, the feeling of inevitability amongst the SNP hierarchy - and note that it is they who are pushing this rather than lsquoordinaryrsquo members - looks like it has a solid ballast. It is entirely possible that we will look back in five years and say ldquoYip, the writing was on the wall.Or maybe not. There is another side to this story, and it remains to be seen whether the lurking risks for the yes campaign have been fully baked into their thinking.At the centre of this is the weekend poll showing unionist:nationalist sentiment at :. This was lauded as a breakthrough the first time a Panelbase poll has recorded such success. It is progress - of that there can be absolutely no doubt. But I am not at all convinced that it is enough. It was not so long ago that ostensibly senior people were briefing the media that they considered % pro-independence polling to be the point at which it was safe to agitate for another referendum. They talked of the stars aligningBrexit turned into a quagmireandBoris Johnson became Prime Minister . How many more stars do they need I see a requirement, from the nationalistsrsquo perspective, for the polling to be signicantly higher, because those lurking risks are real, and they provide a very competitive counterweight to the demographic idend.Despite the polling indicating a perceived stronger economic future inside the EU than inside the UK, it remains a moot point whether economics will again be the Achilles Heel of the Yes campaign. It cannot be downplayed - the fiscal deficit is dismal, the currency question is further spiced by the inevitable debate over whether or not Scotland will have to join the Euro, and the Green-inspired drt to the left is creating an electorally worrying gap between personal tax rates north and south of the border, a gap which is only likely to expand.Other signicant drivers of voter behaviour will undoubtedly be more prevalent this time around. Voters in Scotland have had an election or referendum every year since  with the exception of last year, which despite the lack of a poll was anything but stable. By the time the next referendum comes around, we will have had another two national elections and, presumably, a formal exit from the EU.Lenin said there are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen. We are living that, now, and after the UK eventually leaves the EU it is a monumental request of the politically-fatigued Scottish people to plunge themselves into another potentially dficult constitutional negotiation.And then there is the EU relationship itself, in which so much stock is placed. For what itrsquos worth, I think that we are in a manufactured state. I say as a Remain voter that much of the Europhilia coursing through Scotland is faux, with no real foundation. It is a knee-jerk response to current turmoil. When we leave, votersrsquo default assumptions, and the starting point from which they decide which box to cross, will change.In essence, we will be asking Scottish voters to choose the EU over the UK. We will be asking them to leave a union to which they retain a fair emotional attachment, to join one to which their emotional attachment is unproven, at best. We may even be asking them to authorise the creation of some sort of, albeit probably limited, Scotland-England border checks.It is the ask of asks. So much so that I find it dficult to see the SNPrsquos official position being to immediately rejoin the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, on Andrew Marr on Sunday, invoked EFTA as a short-term post-Brexit solution. I expect that will just be the start."},{"url":null,"title":"ellon woman heads off on mercy mission","story":"Ellon woman Sandra Campbell is preparing for a five-week trip to the West African nation of Senegal where she will be volunteering as a nurse.The -year-old is travelling to the Africa Mercy, the world’s largest charity-run hospital ship, which provides healthcare and training to developing countries.Sandra was inspired to volunteer by a visit to the previous ship, the Anastasis, and learning about the amazing work they did to bringing hope and healing to thousands of people who do not have access to affordable health care. “The surgical care given to patients is truly le transforming for these patients and their families and it is thrilling to be able to be part of it and to see the smiles on their faces when they leave the ship to go home to a better future,” she said.The floating hospital is staffed almost entirely by volunteers from over  dferent nations who work in a iety of roles to help change the lives of some of the world’s poorest people.Mercy Ships has touched more than . million lives since .“We are so grateful for the volunteers who travel to the Africa Mercy to volunteer their time and skills.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-. Of the ship#s  crew members — many of whom were very young men —  were lost.For more coverage of the events taking place around the anniversary of the sinking of the ship, see this Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole..."},{"url":null,"title":"10b charlotte street ","story":"Offers over £,Good-sized, three bedroom, single storey detached property in large, well-established garden with amenities including the High School, leisure centre and Co-op within easy reach, and Lerwickwithin easy commuting distance.In addition to three double bedrooms, the double glazed accommodation which has central heating provided by an air source heat pump, also includes a living room, spacious kitchen   dining room, family bathroom  utility room.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"blessed trinity students set for south africa","story":"NINE Year  students from Blessed Trinity College are preparing for the trip of a letime to South Africa.The young people have teamed up with Paddy Doyle from New Lodge Youth Centre and the Connections Youth Project.They will travel to South Africa on October  to spend  days working on a number of dferent projects in Durban and the surrounding towns and villages before ing home on November .This is the first time the project has been run with a school and Bernadette Little, Vice-Principal of Blessed Trinity College Antrim Road site, is delighted with the upcoming opportunity for the students.“We are happy and privileged to have been asked to come on board the project,” she explained.“We ran an internal application process open to all students and there was a lot of interest,” she said. “They then went for an interview to sell their qualities and skills before the final nine were chosen. There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip. I can’t wait for it. It is a new programme for me as well but it will create a lot of memories and experiences for the young people.”You can keep up to date with the young people’s journey in South Africa on the Connections Youth Project Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"neurology waiting lists a disgrace","story":"ALLIANCE Health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw has branded the latest neurology waiting lists “a disgrace” and warned they are the latest example of people paying for others’ political irresponsibility.The South Belfast MLA was speaking after it was revealed the number of people waiting for a first neurology outpatient appointment here has more than doubled in the past four years.More than , patients have also been waiting more than one year to be seen.“The doubling of waiting lists in the past four years is the latest example of the Health Service descending into a two-tier system, with those who can afford it getting quick diagnoses and treatment while others are left to their anxiety about what is wrong for over a year. This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the great outdoors at a local nursery school","story":"AIDAN Crean fully understands young people’s concern for nature and the future of our planet – in fact the west Belfast environmental supremo ‘got it’ well before anyone  did.When he was young and with the Troubles raging all around, nature and the environment weren’t high on many people’s list of priorities. But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

discriminated against. https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland k-for-psni-officer-discriminated-against-over-beard-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece ff AUTOCROP h __constabledowney.jpgEmailA police firearms officer who was suspended for refusing to shave his beard has said he has been \"vindicated\" after an employment tribunal found he had been discriminated against..pushConstable Gordon Downey was temporarily transferred from the predominantly male Armed Response Unitin February  for not being willing to comply with a policy forcing officers to be clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI mask, tribunal toldPSNI ponytail rule not enforced like one for beards, tribunal toldPSNI firearms officer tells tribunal of his face mask concernsNew rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my client, but all male officers who it is relevant to.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38568793.ece/13a07/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Traffic1.jpg","title":"5000 northern ireland

A retest costs £.. It means that motorists spent almost £, on tests they didnt attend.The no-shows increased from , in July.Former Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said the number of people not turning up for MoTs was \"absolutely crazy\". He called for a thorough analysis of the \"deeply worrying\" figures.\"Its fair to say that the number of people who arent bringing their vehicles for appointments is shocking,\" he said. \"It does have an impact on waiting times for MoT tests.\"I would love to see a deeper analysis of the figures because we need to know why these people arent turning up. Over , people in two months is astonishing. We need a closer look at the figures to seethey really reflect the situation. \"The figures are so high I doubt they could be people just not turning up because cars need MoTs - unless theyre suggesting there are a lot of cars driving around without their MoTs.\"The longest waiting time for an MoT test is at Omagh test centre , followed by Enniskillen , Armagh, Belfast and Cookstown .Motorists getting their MoTs done at the Ballymena test centre had the shortest waiting time .The new figures show that  MoT tests were cancelled in August, and  were cancelled last month.The Driver and Vehicle Agencyis responsible for licensing and testing vehicles and drivers in Northern Ireland. It comes under the remit of DfI.A DfI spokesman said the department is doing everything possible to reduce the backlog. \"DVA is currently testing over , vehicles per week,\" he said.\"In recent months, the appointment of additional staff, together with Sunday and bank holiday openings, have helped manage the increase in applications for tests and reduce waiting times. \"We will continue to keep these arrangements under review and would continue to encourage customers to book their MoT online as soon as they receive the reminder notice.\"In June it emerged that drivers were facing waits of up to  days after an increase of around , applications for tests in the first three months of .The trend continued all summer, with many drivers at risk of breaking the law by driving without a valid vehicle certicate due to being unable to secure an appointment.Sunday appointments were added to the schedule over the summer, alongside an increase in the recruitment of staff at centres."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal can be negotiated in time for eu summit insists government","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Like any negotiation with the EU, and in fact with any major negotiation in le, everything happens at the last minute.“This was always going to be both complicated and come down to the final hours and days, so this doesn’t surprise me. We are going to work round the clock to try to secure it.”Mr Rinne’s comments came as negotiators stepped up efforts to work out a way to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island.“I think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU Council meeting. We need more time,” Mr Rinne said during a Helsinki press conference, in remarks reported by Reuters.A Cabinet briefing on Brexit was understood to have been postponed by Mr Johnson as negotiators continued talks to hammer out a new deal ahead of the October  deadline.Tuesday’s planned update to senior ministers was said to have been delayed until Wednesday so he can give more detailed information on efforts to strike a new agreement.The PM has been under increasing pressure to concede greater ground to Brussels, with reports suggesting the UK has dropped a demand that a deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly on customs arrangements.Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney raised some hopes by saying “a deal is possible”, maybe even this week, but stressed “we’re not there yet”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Simon Coveney In similar comments, Mr Johnson told senior ministers there was “still a signicant amount of work to get there” but a “pathway” to a deal was still visible.The two-day EU summit is crucial because the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturdayhe is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.The Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to a no deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article MPs do not back a deal by then.There are fears that a loophole could be used to avoid this, with the PM repeatedly ruling out making the extension request under his “do or die” pledge to get Brexit done by the Halloween deadline.Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested the Government could use European law to achieve no deal.“Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the  European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,” he said on BBC Radio ’s Westminster Hour.Labour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the legislation.Regardless of the outcome in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday – the first in  years –MPs approve the unusual move.They will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next in the Brexit saga."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38595252.ece/84a54/BINARY/alert.jpg","title":"homes evacuated after suspect package found in derry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Foryou know who should hear ya, you know what youd get..pushThose lyrics kept repeating in my head after the summit between An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Nobody was saying much about anything.And the chorus wasnt much better. Take the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, on the meeting: \" I am not going into the details of the negotiations.\" Then Micheal Martin. Leader of Fianna Fail: \" The less said in public, the better!\" And the Taoiseach, in rare harmony, said: \"I wont be going into detail as its sensitive. When in discussions, the less said, the better.\" Read MoreDUP warns PM it wont back any deal that traps us in EUSuzanne Breen: The national embarrassment, everyone agrees we deserve better but no one has the guts to change things Of course, they are talking about Brexit deadlines, deals and the orce that dare not speak its name.In fairness, the mood music around the Merseyside summit was good. It would not have lasted three hours had it not been reasonably constructive.The Taoiseach and Prime Minister appeared to have a good rapport.Personal relationships are important at times of crisis.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetSometimes An Taoiseach is easily flattered and Mr Johnson is well known for his powers of seduction - so the optics come with a heavy qualication. The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us. This will be a relaxed evening where we can sit back and listen to the enthralling stories from those glory days.The event will be sponsored by The Irish News and the organising committee would like to thank them for their support and backing.Tickets can be purchased in OrsquoToolersquos bar, Loughinisland GAC clubrooms, or by contacting the clubrsquos Facebook page, email loughinislandgac@gmail, or calling  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Armstrong.jpg","title":"Armstrong takes second at Lurgan  ","story":"THE first round of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross League, hosted by Apollo CC at Lurgan Park, took place on Sunday.It was certainly a testing time for the course setters. There was a clearly much debate from the competitors about how muddy it was going to be andthey would have enough wet weather gear.As it turned out, the sun would appear and the rain would disappear leaving Lurgan Park looking beautully tranquil.The first race up was the U- race with Fiadh Kellett, Hugh and Conor Hetherington flying the flag for Dromara CC and more importantly loving the mud. Great to see them enjoying it.The U-s boysrsquo race saw young Oscar McBride loving the mud as he battled through the crown to claim eighth place in a competitive race.Aoe Kellett was in a tough U- girlsrsquo race that saw her put in a tremendous effort to claim third place with second place not far away. A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

Andra Hamilton was enjoying the course and claimed a battling th place.The final race of the day was the menrsquos A race which saw Barry Kellett, Neil Armstrong and Derek Graham take to the start line.Kellett showed that moving the M category certainly hasnrsquot slowed him down as he battled with his younger rival Graham Boyd, from McConvey Cycles, for the top spot.This time it was Graham who held on to take the win, but an excellent second place and top M for Barry. Neil Armstrong claimed th just ahead of Derek Graham in th.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie. I think adults could learn from children as they might ask a question about the arm but once itrsquos answered, they move on as they are very accepting..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Brief.jpg","title":"Brief to redevelop Irish Street closer  ","story":"A DEVELOPMENT brief designed to transform the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent empty buildings could be ready within weeks, the Down Recorder understands.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy.Final agreement has been reached with all key stakeholders to draw up a dedicated team to come up with a development brief which will outline what the local authority would like to see developed at a huge area of land.The brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area, while there are also plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise its potential and make the most of its historical heritage.When completed, the development brief will be advertised, inviting third parties to come forward with viable proposals for the site that will result in sustainable regeneration in Downpatrick town centre.It has also been confirmed that permission has been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.A number of the vacant buildings will be bulldozed to open up a huge area at the rear of the former police station, with the proposed development site also including the local authority-owned car park.But the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious multi-million pound regeneration plan. It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time. The Irish Street proposal has the potential to transform the town centre, providing additional business for existing traders, Cllr Curran added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 By.jpg","title":"By George he’s got it as Bright come good  ","story":"THE long wait is over. Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

I am now glad to put the record straight after all these years.The sides have met twice in the league this season, drawing - to - at Pairc Eoghan Rua and Kilcoo won thegame in Warrenpoint - to -.The mood music in Kilcoo this season has been good.Their - to - win over Clonduff in the league last Wednesday night clinched the ACFL Division  crown, last lted by Mickey Morans side in  and they are even more intent on adding the Frank OHare Cup on Sunday.Losing out to Burren in last years decider was a big blow to Kilcoo, but they have put that reversal behind them with the exact same squad of players.What you see with Kilcoo is what you get.They have a unique work ethic and everything revolves around the team as a unit. No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday. They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots. There are people from Aleppo and Homs who are running round Aberystwyth using words like ‘red up’ and ‘carnaptious’.”Huge interest in new book on RHI scandal by Sam McBrideLatest update from criminal cases heard at Portsmouth Magistrates Court Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

An earlier immigration tribunal had upheld the right of Ms De Souza to declare herself as Irish without first renouncing British citizenship.Unionists have been alarmed by the case. The UUP welcomed the upper tribunal ruling as “confirming that UK nationality law is consistent with the Belfast Agreement”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It said: “Mike Nesbitt attended an event in support of Emma De Souza in a personal capacity.”Mr Nesbitt said: “Emma wishes to declare herself Irish and carve out a le with her husband Jake in Northern Ireland. She thought the  Agreement afforded those rights. The courts say no. We need a political debate on the implications.”Continued from page oneThe Home Office had rejected the application on the grounds that it considered Ms De Souza a British citizen. Officials told her she should could either reapply identying herself as British, or renounce her UK citizenship and reapply as an Irish citizen.The judges in today’s ruling were emphatic Ms De Souza’s arguments.They said: “It the parties to the multi-party agreement and the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom had intended the concept of self-identication necessarily to include a person’s ability to reject his or her Irish or British citizenship, it is inconceivable that the provisions would not have dealt with this expressly.”Ms De Souza, from Magherafelt, argued that she never considered herself British, so how could she renounce citizenship she never had.She took a legal case against the Home Office and won, with a judge at a First Tier Immigration Tribunal ruling that she was an “Irish national only who has only ever been such”.The Home Office appealed against that decision.Long Lawford campaigners disgusted over county councils response to their petition to bring A bus back Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Ms De Souza said today:“We have not received a decision in our favour, the decision has gone in the favour of the secretary of state.“We have unfortunately lost. We are both deeply disappointed by this decision today.”She insisted her legal battle would go on.“After four years it’s safe to say we won’t be lying down anytime soon,” she said.Ms DeSouza says the Home Office position is contrary to the Belfast Agreement, which gave anyone from NI the right to identy as British or Irish.The News Letter has recently run articles from unionists involved in the  negotiations, Dermot Nesbitt and Peter Weir, who both made clear that there was never any prospect of unionists supporting an end to automatic citizenship.l Letters and Morning View, page try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

Prime Minister Boris Johnson meet in Cheshire last week. \"I think its pretty clear what were trying to do, but there are pretty detailed technical discussions now and I think we need to give the time and space for that to happen.\"Hopefully we can make progress today on those.\"He added: \"The message I would give is that we need to be cautious. This is not an easy job. Weve spent three years trying to get an agreement between the two sides and have made progress at dferent times.\"But certainly the last number of months have been dficult. So I think, as my Taoiseach has said, a deal is possible, and its possible this month, may even be possible this week. But were not there yet.D.U.P. leader, Arlene Foster and Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.\"And, as Michel Barnier said yesterday, theres still a lot of work to do, so I hope that we can make more progress today.\"Mr Coveney added: \"Our priority is to try to provide certainty to so many people who are awaiting a Brexit outcome and to do that as soon as possible.\"In a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU on Sunday in Brussels, Mr Barnier said that \"a lot of work remains to be done\".Appeal for calm over ‘loyalist action’ plan in event of Irish Sea border Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald spoke to the Prime Minister about the Stormont veto idea by telephone on Sunday, and told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"He assured me, or sought to assure me, that there would be no vetos afforded to anybody in this process. So I can only take him on his word on that matter.\"Mr Johnson has told senior ministers that, while a \"pathway\" to a deal could still be seen, there was \"still a signicant amount of work to get there\".In a Cabinet conference call, he said they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.And Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Government could achieve a no-deal Brexit by using European law.\"Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the  European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,\" he said on BBC Radio s Westminster Hour.\"And the Remainiacs all know that, because they know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council.\"The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is noof a hard border with the Republic.Mr Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.There were reported to be doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tarf to be paid depending where they end up.It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any th hour agreement.However,Mr Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.Labour has warned that,necessary, it will take action through the courts to force the PM to comply with the co-called Benn Act, which requires him to request an extension.Either way, the stage is set for a major Commons showdown when Mr Johnson s to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first in  years.If he cannot get a deal, he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, paving the way for a \"people versus Parliament\" general election.If he is able to get an agreement, Government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to raty it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There was no power or water so we had to boil water at home for tea and coffee.ldquoThe new one has a sink, microwave and wersquore getting a fridge.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.
