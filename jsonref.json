I had open burns. I lost three stones in weight. I went from 10 stones down to seven. It was awful. It was three years of mental abuse and then it turned physical.’Mr Skeel, pictured with Worth, has bravely waived his right to anonymityThe couple met at drama college in Bedford and went on to live together in the nearby village of Stewartby.Mr Skeel said Worth was mentally abusive for about three to four years – before she turned violent for the final nine months of their relationship.Isolated from his family by her demands, Mr Skeel said his parents suspected he was being mentally abused, but did not know about the physical violence.Explaining how the violence began, he said: ‘I started off with little things with her just hitting me, and punching me and then I got to her having a bottle in her hand.Worth will spend seven and a half years behind bars (Picture: South Beds News Agency)‘And every time I removed a weapon, she will go onto the next one and it led to being hit with hammers, getting stabbed with knives and having boiling water thrown over me.’Last June, neighbours called emergency services to their home – and paramedics noted Mr Skeel had burns to his arms and legs that were being self-treated with cling film.He was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital, where he said a doctor suspected what was going on and asked if it was safe for him to return home, and alerted the police.Mr Skeel admitted he was ‘scared of the consequences of going against the person that was abusing me’.Worth aspired to be a teacher (Picture: South Beds News Agency)Despite her arrest and subsequent sentence, Worth is reportedly in a new relationship with James Clarke and was living in Ingoldisthorpe, Norfolk.The shocking extent of her abuse became apparent during a court hearing on Monday.Man charged with fraud over Grenfell Tower fireLabour MPs reveal anti-Semitism they have faced as they demand actionWorth banned him from their bed, the court heard, took control of his Facebook page, told him what clothes to wear and refused to help him get medical treatment after injuring him.Alongside her prison sentence, Worth was handed a restraining order preventing her from contacting Mr Skeel for an indefinite period."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/byron-flexitarian-burger-e1523971519239.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"people confused byrons new flexitarian burger","story":"(Picture: Byron)This week in brands confusing everyone, we’re (sadly) not talking about penis-shaped makeup sponges or typos on ASOS bags.Instead people are puzzled by Byron, who have just launched a new burger that they describe as ‘flexitarian’.They’ve also launched the Reflex burger, which is the same thing but with fancier toppings – red pepper ketchup, fresh tomato, red onion, baby kale, roasted garlic, and rosemary mayonnaise.Which all sounds lovely. If you’re desperate for a meaty burger but keen to reduce your meat intake, maybe the flexitarian burger could be the answer.(Picture: Byron)But rather than rejoicing over the meaty mushroom mashup, people have been a little stuck on the name.Because to most of us, being a flexitarian means you eat vegetarian options for some meals, or on some days, but occasionally eat meat or fish for other meals, or on other days.Surely, if you’re a flexitarian, that means the entire menu is already open to you. If you fancy being vegetarian on the specific day you’re at Byron, you get one of the veggie options. If you’re gagging for some meat, you get a meat burger. Right?Exec: “Mushrooms. In the beef. We can say it’s flexitarian?”Other, smarter exec: “That’s not what th-“Bigger Exec: “I love it.”And of course, along with confusion came some shady references to Byron’s past.To be fair to Byron, the Flexi burger probably is a good idea for anyone who’s flexitarian in the sense that they want to cut down on their meat consumption without giving it up entirely.Clearly they’re trying to do a nice thing.‘The Flex and the Reflex burgers have been created because our customers want them,’ said Paul Mason, head of food at Byron. ‘Whether it be for health or sustainability reasons, there’s lot of people who are more conscious about the amount of meat they’re eating right now.‘The Reflex comes topped with house-made red pepper ketchup, fresh tomato, red onion, baby kale, roasted garlic \u0026amp rosemary mayonnaise. Both burgers can be cooked to your liking of either medium or well done.‘These burgers are just one of many new products that we’re launching across the UK to offer proper burger ersity. Whether you’re a meat-lover, veggie, vegan or simply having a meat-free Monday, you’ll find yourself at home in a Byron.’See? They’re trying to be nice. It’s just that they have incurred the wrath and mockery of the internet, and are now doomed.Sorry, Byron. Perhaps don’t hop on a dietary trend to market an otherwise interesting burger next time.MORE: A beer company is looking to pay someone to drink beer and travel to AmericaMORE: Cheeseburger Pringles exist and they sound incredibleMORE: Attention, Pink Ladies: A Grease-themed slumber party is coming to London"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_77747561.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"rent jess 580 room deptford","story":"(Picture: Alexander Crawley)To help us all navigate the hellscape that is the London housing situation, we’ve launched a new series called What I Rent.Each week we’ll be taking you around a different Londoner’s home, showing all the nooks, crannies, and grotty sinks to give us all a better understanding of what’s normal.Because it’s tricky to make sense of renting when we swing between seeing people’s Pinterest-y pads and depressingly tiny studio rooms.What’s a normal amount to pay each month? What should you be getting for your money? Is everyone else putting up with a shower in the kitchen?Second in our series is Jess, 24, who lives in Deptford.(Picture: Alexander CrawleyusSo, how much are you paying?I pay £580 a month which includes all bills including council tax.And what are you getting for that princely sum?The flat is in Deptford in South East. It’s zone 2 but a wee bit out of the way so no tube line unfortunately.There’s four bedrooms in total, and since I moved in a few months ago one of the rooms has been empty. A new girl just moved in recently, so perhaps it’s going to be a fight to get to the shower in the mornings, but I reckon a house of four is not too bad.There are two bathrooms, but one of those is just a toilet and a sink.The groundfloor bathroom is just a toilet and a sink. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusHow long have you lived there?I’ve lived here since the end of February after a fire at my old flat meant I had to move pretty sharpish. I’m still kinda in that in-between place where I’ve got to buy stuff for my room and the kitchen, so not fully at home yet but getting there.How did you find this place? Every flat I’ve lived in since I moved to London two years ago was from SpareRoom.It’s pretty hit and miss, and plenty of dodgy agents, but not all bad. I’m really careful now after some bad experiences – including a creepy landlord who used to call me at night ‘just to chat’.I am happy here, but because of the circumstances of moving it’s not quite ‘home’ to me. I love the area so much (great markets, lovely people, a really good local) that I’d struggle to live anywhere else in London.My housemates are nice too, striking the balance between cool and chatty but not all up in my personal space. I also think I’ve managed to put a bit of a stamp on my room so it feels like my own – so many people I know just have a white box with their clothes in. That sounds like hell to me.Do you feel like you have enough space?Space isn’t really an issue, but there definitely isn’t enough storage for me.There are no drawers in her room, so Jess makes do with some small shelves. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)At the moment my underwear is all in some Ikea shelf because there are no drawers, and I’ve got loads of storage containers full of shoes. Get me a wardrobe like Kylie Jenner’s and I’ll never complain again.I’d also want space to put a TV in my room. Netflix on my laptop makes me feel like a teenage boy.And the people you live with. Did you know them before you moved in together?Nope, all new people.I’ve considered living with my best friend, but being a bit of an introvert I’m not sure they’d cope with my need to be by myself a lot of the time.Also I’d rather not fight with an IRL friend over blocked sinks and who took the bins out last.Are there any major issues with your renting situation that you have to put up with?The glaring issue with this flat is that there’s no bath. I’m not quite sure how I’m surviving without one as it used to be my way to relax after a hard day, and I’ve nearly died a few times trying to stretch in the shower cubicle when it’s time to shave my legs.There are also some issues with mould and ants (I promise I’m a clean person, but they both just KEEP COMING BACK) and although the landlord is supposed to come over to clean once a week I don’t ever notice anything being clean – sorry, landlord.The bathroom sink. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusIt’s just an old flat so no matter how much you clean there’s still rusty bits and broken things. In an ideal world it’d get renovated and be boujee as hell, but for under £600 all in I can’t see it happening any time soon.As you can see in the photos, the thermostat is in a weird locked box. There’s a locked cupboard with stuff in it that we could really use sometimes (like a mop and basic tools).I’m not sure if the landlord doesn’t trust us or he’s had issues with people in the past, but it takes away from any comfortable vibe the flat might have had – like a constant reminder it’s not ‘our place’.Oh, also, not to be a grass, but none of the windows work properly which freaks the sh*t out of me since my housemates nearly died in the fire at my last flat. It does keep me awake some nights worrying I wouldn’t be able to get out if anything happened, but there’s not much I can do about it.The thermostat is in a locked box. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusAny plans to move?I’m planning on moving in the next few months but trying not to rush it and find something I love rather than moving for moving’s sake like last time.I want a bath in the next place and perhaps more of a homely vibe with somewhere I can stay for a few years. Also, a cat. If there’s a cat involved I’m signing that lease ASAP.And, um, any plans to buy?Hahaha what a cute question. No, on a journalist’s salary I’m not looking into buying anywhere, but if anyone wants to PayPal me £100k for a deposit after seeing how I live I’ll send you my deets.Feel free to give us £100k while you’re at it. In the meantime, let’s have a look around Jess’s place:But other than that, she’s pretty happy. Even when she is lurking in the corner.

Labour\u0027s David Lammy told fellow MPs it was a \u0027day of national shame\u0027.Campaigners insisted that at least one person had already been wrongly sent back to Jamaica. It emerged at the weekend that Government officials had refused to meet Caribbean envoys to discuss the cases of those who came from the late 1940s to the 1970s to help rebuild post-war Britain.            Miss Rudd faced a call to resign and was summoned to the Commons to apologise for the fiasco. Labour\u0027s David Lammy told fellow MPs it was a \u0027day of national shame\u0027Despite living here for decades, many have now mistakenly been told they are illegals under a Home Office crackdown on immigration paperwork. Some have lost their right to work, rent property, receive pensions, access bank accounts and have NHS care. Others have been told they risk detention and deportation.The row turned toxic yesterday when immigration minister Caroline Nokes suggested there had been deportations. As ministers were branded \u0027inhumane and cruel\u0027:- Miss Rudd said the Home Office was \u0027too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes lost sight of the inidual\u0027 - Commonwealth countries will be contacted to check whether anyone had been wrongly removed- A taskforce will speed up the regularisation of immigration status for tens of thousands of citizens- Cases will be resolved in two weeks and the £229 fee will be waived- Theresa May performed a U-turn by agreeing to meet Caribbean leaders who have been raising concerns- A cross-party group of 140 MPs wrote to the Prime Minister demanding \u0027immediate and effective\u0027 action.Miss Nokes made her comments in an interview with Channel 4 News. She said: \u0027Potentially they have been deported and I\u0027m conscious that it\u0027s very much in error and that\u0027s an error I want to put right.\u0027Then she told ITV News that some people had been booted out of the UK \u0027horrendously\u0027, adding: \u0027I don\u0027t know the numbers, but what I am determined to do going forward is to say we will have no more of this.\u0027In the aftermath of her interviews, officials insisted no one had been deported in the immigration crackdown.But then in the Commons, Miss Rudd said she was not aware of any cases but was investigating and conceded some members of the \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 may have been wrongly sent back to the Caribbean.          Leaders from Caribbean countries who wanted to discuss with Theresa May the plight of those who have lost their everyday rights as Britons have been told there will be no formal meeting with the Prime Ministers (pictured: the SS Empire Windrush which brought the first generation of workers to Britain from the West Indies in 1948)          New rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here, which many Windrush children do not have as anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain, meaning many did not apply for a British passport          Communities Secretary Sajid Javid took to Twitter to voice \u0027deep concern\u0027 about the situationShe added: \u0027That is why I have asked the high commissioners if they know of any, that they should bring it to me.\u0027Last night, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said at least one person had wrongly been sent back to Jamaica. Satbir Singh, who is the charity\u0027s chief executive, said: \u0027It is true, but it is very difficult to know how many people have been removed. What\u0027s shocking is that the Government admits that it has no record of the numbers.\u0027Downing Street said Mrs May wanted to ensure that \u0027no one with the right to be here will be made to leave\u0027.     Albert Thompson, who has been denied life saving treatment on the NHSAlbert Thompson, 63, has lived in London for 44 years - but told he must pay £54,000 for life saving treatment on the NHS.For three decades Mr Thompson worked, supported a family, and was a head mechanic for a string of garages, and paid his taxes.His mother arrived in the UK from Jamaica in the Sixties to come and work her as a nurse. He had surgery for prostate cancer in January last year, before NHS eligibility rules were tightened, and was to begin radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, last November. But when he arrived for his first NHS radiotherapy session following the removal of his prostate, he was told he was not entitled to free treatment. It is because the Home Office can find no record of Mr Thompson, who was born in Jamaica, in its files. He lost the Caribbean passport he arrived in the UK with some years ago. And without a British passport - which he\u0027s never had and cannot not get because there is no documentary proof of his arrival here as a teenager in 1973, landlords will not house him and the NHS have told his he can\u0027t have treatment. He said: \u0027At present I\u0027m left in limbo. It feels like I\u0027ve been left to die because the job hasn\u0027t been finished. I get depressed, stressed out, anxious.\u0027I used to have a life, to work, to go out, enjoy myself. I had a nice car, a home. I went to the cinema, dancing. But that\u0027s the past. I have to think about the present and it\u0027s hard to come to terms with. I\u0027ve got no money.\u0027I\u0027m very angry with the Government that I\u0027m in this position. I\u0027m here legally, but they\u0027re asking me to prove I\u0027m British.\u0027 Mr Thompson worked until 2008 when he was diagnosed with the blood cancer lymphoma and an acute back problem since then he has been too ill to work. He was evicted from his rented flat because his landlord wanted to sell it. Tenants must now produce a British passport in order to rent accommodation. As Albert — not his real name — does not have a passport, he could not find a home.\u0027I was on the streets for three weeks. I had to beg for food. I felt ashamed. I just asked people in shops if they had anything spare.\u0027After three weeks, Albert had managed to secure a room through a homeless charity, St Mungo\u0027s. He still lives in that accommodation now.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/07/4B12542000000578-0-image-a-17_1523513785551.jpg","title":"Sewage plant completely blocked granny pants","story":"The huge pants, were discovered by workers at the treatment plant who found thy contained a label with the name \u0027Eileen\u0027Down the toilet bowl!

It did catch me off guard.\u0027He added: \u0027She kissed me. She made the move. And I think I was like, OK – we\u0027re at that phase of our relationship right now, we\u0027re kissing. That was what happened.\u0027There were other kisses after that moment. She definitely made the first move and initiated the first act of affection in that way.\u0027Silverstein, who still lives in Los Angeles, said the duo had previously hugged and held hands but had never gone further until the actress, now 36, took matters into her own hands.Meghan later recounted the moment during a 2013 interview with Larry King, telling the veteran host: \u0027I was 13, it was a summer camp and I kissed him!\u0027Silverstein added: \u0027We had already become a couple. We had held hands prior - I\u0027ve always been affectionate, so we\u0027d already hugged. But the kiss was definitely her, her initiative absolutely.\u0027The teenage romance began after the pair met at a drama-focused summer camp organized by the Agape International Spiritual Center.Silverstein has grown up to be a star in the US as he is an actor, comedian and rapper who appears on The Late, Late Show. He is now a married father-of-two young children still living in Los Angeles, but he still remembers his romance with Meghan           Meghan and Silverstein met at a drama summer camp at their local Agape Spiritual Church.

Silverstein said that he believes Meghan will continue her activism work once she marries Prince Harry. Meghan is pictured above outside Buckingham Palace as a teenagerSilverstein describes the 13-year-old Meghan as being \u0027very sweet\u0027, charming and \u0027quirky\u0027 but already displaying the determined streak that took her to success in Suits and a glamorous royal life in London after she weds Prince Harry next month.\u0027Meghan as a 13-year-old was very kind, very sweet, very talented, very interested in the theater camp – it was then that we saw how impressive she was on stage,\u0027 he said.\u0027She was charming and quirky. She wasn\u0027t a stereotypical 13-year-old girl she wasn\u0027t decked out in pink every single day, she wasn\u0027t flaunting make-up or anything.\u0027She was her own person, very authentic to who she was at the time. She was curious, I think she was serious about her craft.\u0027In true teen fashion, the pair realized they liked each other after telling friends about their respective crushes.\u0027I found out from our friends that she liked me and I liked her and I just think we decided it would be a good idea to become boyfriend and girlfriend,\u0027 Silverstein said.The relationship wasn\u0027t his first: he had previously kissed girls at kindergarten and had a \u0027girlfriend\u0027 in first grade.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to attend Stephen Lawrence...Let the madness begin!

For me it was almost surreal being there.

It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in Dallas that there were no problems with the plane or its engine when it was inspected Sunday.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Horrific accident caught on camera leaves three dead\u0027We breathed the smell of blood\u0027: Girl describes chemical attackMan is shot and robbed at gas station in broad daylight8-year-old girl raped and murdered a wedding in IndiaMoment Theresa May appears to roll her eyes at Jeremy CorbynPrecious moment gorilla kisses her baby seconds after birthDrug smugglers caught at Heathrow trying to move £16m of cocaineAdorable moment dog teases baby and play chase around living roomDramatic moment knife wielding cyclist is tackled by pedestriansBusinessman snared by paedo hunters after trying to meet schoolgirlHilarious moment cat tries to take sticker off of its headLast year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. Underground radio station set up by son of billionaire Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid sex harassment and exploitation claimsMargot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache?It turns out it could. Bruxism — the medical term for the involuntary clenching and grinding of the teeth, usually during sleep — is soaring. According to the NHS, as many as six million suffer, and the majority are women aged 25 to 44, like me. While it may sound like a minor irritation, it can do an awful lot of damage.Come on, Eileen!

Normal chewing puts between 20lb and 40lb of pressure on your teeth, but grinding or clenching can exert a force equivalent to an astonishing 300lb.It’s enough pressure to crack a walnut shell — and teeth-grinders can be doing it for as much as 40 minutes of every hour they’re asleep.          According to my boyfriend, who had to contend with me making an awful gnashing noise in my sleep, I did. But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache? (pictured: Lara King)No wonder it can take its toll on teeth, wearing them down and causing them to crack, break or become more sensitive.It’s also not uncommon for problems to surface in the neck, shoulders and back as the jaw muscles become so tight that pain is referred to other parts of the body.Teeth-grinding can even be behind a range of symptoms as varied as vertigo and hearing loss, by triggering inflammation in the inner-ear muscles.It can ruin your looks, too. ‘If someone grinds a lot you can sometimes see it in their face, because the muscles increase in size from overwork,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, aesthetic dentist and director at London Smiling Dental Group.‘It’s like building up your biceps with weights. You end up with more muscle mass in the face and jaw.’The result can be a square face, bulging hamster cheeks or ‘lantern jaw’ — a long, thin jaw with a prominent chin.          Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the triggerA British Medical Journal study also found that a loss of lower facial height due to teeth wearing down can make you appear as much as 20 years older.With all of that to worry about, it’s a wonder we ever sleep at all.So what causes teeth-grinding? The experts are agreed: stress.Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the trigger. Dr Patel’s practice has seen cases of bruxism rocket by 30 per cent in five years as our lives become increasingly high-pressured.Most of her patients are women, but Dr Patel has also started treating children as young as 11.She says: ‘When some people are stressed they break out in spots, or get rashes or stomach upsets. Others grind their teeth.’If you think a glass of wine before bed will relax you, think again. Not only does alcohol reduce deep sleep, making grinding more likely, but Andrew Eder, a professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, says that acidic drinks such as prosecco and white wine soften enamel so it’s more easily worn away through grinding.For me, two-and-a-half years after that rather painful lunch, teeth-grinding is a nightly battle that has left me with a fissure in one tooth, a clicky jaw and bouts of neck stiffness, headaches and jaw pain.And while the experts say that a spell of stress is likely to have triggered my grinding in the first place, they also warn that once it starts, it can become habitual. When I visit Dr Patel, she tells me that it’s left a line of dentine (hard, dense, bony tissue) visible on the edges of my top and bottom teeth — showing that I’ve worn away the enamel.Enamel can’t be replaced, and losing it raises the risk of cavities, decay and infection. I take good care of my teeth and pride myself on having no fillings, so it’s infuriating that something I’m doing when I’m sound asleep is damaging them.Still, it seems I’m one of the luckier ones. Emily Mason’s grinding was so severe she destroyed one tooth entirely and had to endure a root canal treatment.Emily, a 37-year-old communications consultant from Wokingham in Berkshire discovered she was grinding her teeth three years ago. ‘I had a lot of pain in what seemed to be every single one of my teeth,’ she says. ‘My entire mouth was aching constantly. I felt like I was going mad, because I just couldn’t get to the bottom of what was causing it.’Her husband Chris, 36, hadn’t noticed Emily was grinding her teeth, but her dentist eventually spotted the signs. In an attempt to stop it, Emily had three of her molars filed down, as her dentist suggested it would make her bite more even and let all of her teeth take the force of the grinding, rather than just one or two. But it wasn’t enough.‘Things came to a head last year when I had to have a root canal.‘I had clamped my teeth so hard together on such a regular basis that I had stopped the blood supply to a tooth. I was mortified that I’d allowed the situation to get to that point.’Emily admits she’s a ‘natural worrier’, but says: ‘I’m not sure what triggered it. I work full-time and have two young sons — Archie, seven, and four-year-old Rufus — and I don’t live near my family, which means the school run, helping at Beaver Scout group and generally being a taxi service all falls to me.‘But that’s nothing out of the ordinary for most mums.’In an attempt to break the cycle, she is now having her teeth straightened at a cost of £3,500.‘My dentist told me many of his patients who have done this notice they’re clenching less,’ she explains.‘If the alignment isn’t perfect, people may grind and clench their teeth trying to find a comfortable way for the upper and lower teeth to sit together.’Her Invisalign braces — clear plastic aligners that sit snugly over the teeth — will also offer her some protection.‘They will create a barrier and stop my teeth from hitting one another when I do grind,’ says Emily.Mouthguards worn at night are most dentists’ first course of action — but they can do more harm than good. Experts warn that the soft plastic variety that can be bought over the counter actually encourage grinding by inducing a chewing response.Dr Okoye recommends patients have a hard ‘splint’ mouthguard custom-made at a cost of up to £1,000. But even at that price, it won’t last for ever.‘The hardest substance in the human body is enamel, and if that’s ground away there’s no manmade thing I can replace it with that you won’t chomp away at, too,’ admits Dr Okoye.And while guards shield the teeth from damage, they can’t stop the grinding action, so a guard won’t necessarily alleviate the other symptoms.In desperation, more and more women are turning to radical treatments — including Botox. Tracey Jones, 49, a personal assistant, has spent at least £3,000 over the past five years on chiropractors and physiotherapists to try to relieve agonising pain in her back, neck and shoulders.Two years ago, her dentist diagnosed bruxism and said it was likely she’d been grinding for over a decade. He gave Tracey, from Cheshire, a mouthguard, but she says it didn’t stop the muscles clenching.Tracey, who is married with two grown-up daughters, is now trying Botox. More commonly used to smooth away wrinkles, the chemical is injected into the skin where it partially paralyses muscles. The theory is that injecting it into the muscles in the jaw reduces their activity.‘I had the treatment in September,’ Tracey says. ‘It took just five minutes and the effects last up to six months — although it takes ten days to start working.‘Each session costs £550, but today I estimate that I’m 85 per cent better than I was before.‘I’m sleeping through the night without interruption and when I wake up I’m no longer in pain.‘Fortunately it hasn’t affected my ability to chew or eat as it affects a different set of muscles.’But experts are ided on the safety of Botox for teeth-grinding, pointing to evidence that it may eat away at the jawbone.Our bones constantly regenerate, and rely on impact and muscle movement to produce new bone cells. When the jaw muscle’s activity is reduced by Botox, it can’t push and pull the jaw as powerfully, hampering the process.One study suggests a single treatment could trigger a loss of bone density of as much as 40 per cent, increasing the risk of teeth becoming loose or even falling out.So how can you tell if you’re grinding? Professor Eder says to ask your dentist to look for the tell-tale signs: ‘You’ll normally see a white horizontal line inside the cheeks, just adjacent to where the teeth meet, in people who are actively grinding.‘You may also see indentations on either side of the tongue.‘Eventually, worn teeth can become more sensitive, get sharp at the edges, chip and become shorter.’ Ultimately, the question remains: How do we stop something that we’re doing while we’re asleep?Perhaps part of the answer is not worrying about it too much. Dr Okoye says: ‘We used to try to cure people of teeth-grinding, but we now realise we can’t. It’s para-sympathetic, meaning it’s unconscious and involuntary — like breathing, or your heart beating.‘Instead, what we can do is protect the teeth with a mouthguard and give people tools to change their behaviour by learning to manage their stress. These can be as simple as sticking Post-It notes around your house saying “relax”.‘Many patients won’t realise how tense they are until they see that sign and consciously loosen up.‘Everyone wants some sexy, difficult treatment. But it really is just a case of stress management and creating an awareness of how important it is to relax.’As for me, I’ve decided to see if a mouthguard can help put an end to my waking nightmare — and to try not to let the daily grind wear me (and my teeth) down any longer."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/22/4B3A0DE600000578-0-image-a-67_1523912929566.jpg","title":"The 200 000 dogs overfed got arthritis","story":"    Labradors and golden retrievers are most commonly treated for the condition, which causes painful, inflamed joints (file photo)Man, 22, is arrested and charged with \u0027stealing Gus the...Owner returns home to find her delighted dog playing in a...Share this articleThe study by the Royal Veterinary College said neutering also made pets more prone to arthritis, possibly because it cuts off sex hormones that may protect against it.Being above average weight for their breed made dogs 2.3 times more likely to have arthritis diagnosed, while males were 1.2 times more likely to have the condition than bitches.

Institute in Canada asked 34 people to copy simple melodies created at random by computer and to sing an ascending scale, hitting the highest note possible, as well as a descending scale to the lowest note they could reach.Excluding the six people who could not whistle, the results show people\u0027s singing was less precise than their whistling.The study, led by Dr Michel Belyk, from Bloorview Research Institute and the University of Maastricht, states: \u0027Despite the vocal virtuosity of humans relative to other apes, there is a population of iniduals- colloquially referred to as \u0027tone deaf\u0027- who are notable in their poor abilities as singers.\u0027However, tone deafness is a misnomer, as these iniduals do not necessarily have a deficit in hearing musical sounds, but rather in singing them.\u0027           Humans can use their larynx to sing, inject emotion into their words and go up at the end of sentence to indicate they are asking a questionThe results of the study help to explain why even virtuoso opera singers cannot match musical instruments like the violin for perfect pitch. While humans have a direct pathway from the brain to the larynx not seen in other great apes, they seem to have problems using it completely accurately.The study authors recruited people who self-identified as good and bad singers to copy the two sets of 45 melodies created by computer within a single octave. They did so in a sound chamber with a microphone, with software picking up mistakes in their ability to match the notes they heard.The results show people who could whistle precisely were also better able to sing precisely. Notes which were sung, using a single vowel rather than words in the study, were more likely to be flat and whistled notes to be sharp.World\u0027s first singing road that plays German regional anthem...Share this articleBut c, according to the research published in the study Royal Society Open Science.The study states: \u0027Sung imitations were less precise than whistled imitations, although neither were on the order of precision that have previously been reported for continuous pitch instruments, such as the violin.\u0027 The results may show why our nearest relatives, the great apes, have the vocal abilities to blow raspberries and whistle but cannot sing.Humans can use their larynx to sing, inject emotion into their words and go up at the end of sentence to indicate they are asking a question. However the ancient relatives we share with the apes mastered the lips before the larynx, which is why we may not be perfect at this.The authors conclude: \u0027From the relatively recent evolution of vocal production learning in great apes, we suggest that evolution has not tuned the human vocal-motor system to the same degree as other neuro-muscular systems.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/22/4B2193CF00000578-0-image-a-11_1523653886909.jpg","title":"One three child

authorities to track, had rocketed by 86 per cent.The deputy head of the IWF warned the fact that young people were being exposed to more graphic content online could play into the hands of child

For example, a person would be directed to a hidden page from a forum discussing child abuse. But if another web user, who has not been on a child abuse site previously, clicks on the page, they could come up with legitimate adult content instead.The problem is booming with the rise of technology and a ‘comprehensive strategy’ required to stop ‘offenders in their tracks’, the NSPCC has said.A spokesman said: ‘Social networks must ensure that they prioritise child protection and we need the Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, to step in and end the Wild West of the Web.’ The IWF found 78,589 URLs featuring disturbing content last year - a 37 per cent rise compared to 2017. The number of child sexual abuse websites had also exploded by 112 per cent.The figure had soared partly because its staff had become better at finding the horrific content, the charity said. Every seven minutes, the IWF finds footage of a child being sexually abused.          The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which produced the report, said there are more sites hosting child abuse than ever before - soaring by 37 per cent in the last year - with the NSPCC calling on Culture Secretary Matt Hancock to ‘step in and end the Wild West of the web’Fresh imagery was being regularly produced in addition to the historic content being shared again and again.Alarmingly, the charity is also finding more videos of children aged 11 to 15 who create footage of themselves on a webcam and then share it online.‘The amount of content that is out there is always growing, it’s never going to reduce,’ the IWF’s deputy CEO Mr Langford said.Around a third of the material uncovered featured the most severe abuse - category A which includes the rape and sexual torture of children.People were ‘seeking out something just a little bit more extreme’, Mr Langford said, adding: ‘Once the demand is there, the supply follows.’ Writing in the report’s foreword, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there was ‘clearly more we need to do’, while noting that there was ‘worrying rise’ of material hosted in Europe.Offenders were ‘exploit(ing) new vulnerabilities in the online environment to evade detection’, she said. ‘We will continue to work together in our efforts to rise to this challenge and to evolve with it as we look to ensure the UK’s response remains as strong as it can possibly be,’ she added.Her comments came as IWF’s research found that 65 per cent of child sex abuse imagery was being produced in Europe - with the Netherlands as the top host.Mr Langford, IWF’s deputy chief, said abusers were ‘goading’ each other on through the web to post more graphic content with more extreme images granting greater ‘kudos’.‘In the same was as I suppose an international drug deal might say I’m shipping more drugs than you...These people have got that same sort of mentality…It becomes: “I’ve got more extreme content that you”,’ he told the Mail.Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Cambridge-based charity, said: ‘This year we’re seeing offenders getting smarter and finding new ways to abuse legitimate internet services.’ She said it was ‘concerning’ that more disguised websites were being used to evade the authorities.‘We are making huge technological advances, which we’ll be announcing later in the year, but we also need to continue to work globally, in partnership, to fight this disturbing crime. This battle cannot be won in isolation,’ she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e1e3cec9b1051d14c15557700386458d6f311e8/0_135_4586_2753/master/4586.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3b3ccfbd1eb8138305e54e811b7ec7c6 1240w","title":"tate launches 5 art exhibition tickets for young people","story":"Tate Collective aims to make big-name shows more accessible for 16-25-year-olds A £5 ticket scheme has been launched by Tate to increase the number of young people going to ticketed exhibitions.It can cost up to £22 to see a blockbuster exhibition at Britain’s national galleries, which means the vast majority of visitors are from older age groups.On Tuesday Tate’s director, Maria Balshaw, announced details of a scheme called Tate Collective, the first free-to-join membership scheme for 16-25-year-olds at any UK national museum. Anyone of that age, anywhere in the world, can join and get discounts in Tate’s cafes and shops as well as £5 entry per person for themselves and three friends.Currently, 16-25-year-olds make up less than a tenth of the audience for Tate exhibitions. Balshaw said she now expects that figure to increase quickly, without it costing a great deal. “Nothing in life is free but because this is about growth in audience we anticipate it will pay for itself.”Tate also plans to appoint a trustee to represent the views of young people. Balshaw said: “We are acting on what 16-25-year-olds say they want so that we can make the changes needed for future generations. Our sector should be shaped by their creative energy and their message to us is clear: arts institutions should plan with, not for them.”Ticket prices for exhibitions have crept up over recent years. In 2012 it cost visitors £16 to see the big Leonardo da Vinci show at the National Gallery. Weekend tickets for its current Monet show are £22. Standard entry to Tate Modern’s Matisse show in 2014 was £16.30, while it current Picasso show is £22.Balshaw said affordability was an issue and Tate had other shows with cheaper tickets as well as discount schemes for older people. “Larger exhibitions are more expensive to make and have a higher ticket price,” she said.For legal reasons, Tate cannot specify an age range for the new trustee, but they will be expected to have a “commitment, connection and real insight” into the generation born after 1978, Balshaw said.Tate’s initiative has been supported by the culture secretary, Matt Hancock.

It focuses on the travails of an honest man sent to wade through the muck and slime of America’s political Babylon. The exemplar is, of course, the 1939 classic film Mr Smith Goes to Washington, with Jimmy Stewart as the lone man of integrity on the Potomac. But the archetype recurs at intervals in the culture, with the West Wing’s Jed Bartlet a more recent incarnation. And now we can add a new, non-fiction addition: the memoir of James Comey, the FBI director fired a year ago by Donald Trump.Perennially cast as a boy scout – and in Washington that’s usually an insult – Comey establishes his goody-goody credentials early and often. We learn that, when he was in his 20s, people would clap eyes on the 6ft8in lawyer and instantly offer smalltalk about his presumed past as a player of college basketball. As it happens Comey hadn’t played, but in his youth he would let people think he had. “This was a seemingly small and inconsequential lie told by a stupid kid, but it was a lie nonetheless. And it ate at me. So after law school I wrote to the friends I’d lied to and told them the truth,” he writes. Later he gives the director of national intelligence a necktie. Or rather, “I regifted to him a tie my brother-in-law had given me … Because we considered ourselves people of integrity, I disclosed it was a regift.”There’s plenty in that vein, including a declaration that Comey made a habit of using the staff canteen at FBI headquarters and that “I never cut the line … even when I was in a hurry.” Acting pre-emptively to ensure the reader is not left “mildly nauseous” – to quote Comey’s description of how he would feel if he had tipped the election to Trump – by all this virtue, the introduction warns us that the author has long struggled with flaws in his character that include being “stubborn, prideful, overconfident, and driven by ego”. The word “sanctimonious” appears in the book’s first paragraph.All this moral goodness can make Comey an occasionally cloying companion. Nor is the book helped by its apparent dual function as a leadership manual aimed at those who tend to turn left when they board aircraft. There’s lots of management tips for the inspiration-hungry CEO, advice about getting the best from your team and an unfortunate tendency to describe anyone in even a vaguely senior organisational role as a “leader”.Fortunately, though, Comey has quite a story to tell – and that’s even before we get to the Clinton and Trump chapters that have made this book an instant bestseller. His life has been full of drama. As a teenager, he and his kid brother were held at gunpoint in their home by an intruder who turned out to be a wanted serial rapist. He and his wife lost a baby to a preventable infection nine days after the child was born. In his early career as a prosecutor, Comey took on and defeated the Gambino crime family.Yet the temptation is strong to read all this through the lens of what we know will follow. Indeed, the author pushes us in that direction. When he recalls some unhappy childhood memories and offers his thoughts on the psychology of the bully, we know who he has in mind. And he is not afraid to make the connection explicit. Cornered into a dinner a deux with Trump at the White House, and asked to profess his personal loyalty, he is reminded of “Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony – with Trump, in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‘made man’”.For liberal Trump-haters, reading A Higher Loyalty will be a conflicted experience. Comey was both hero and villain in 2016, on the one hand closing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of unsecured email and, on the other, revealing he’d reopened it again less than a fortnight before election day. He both saved her candidacy and buried it.Accordingly, the Hillary chapters will be hard going for those who hoped she would become America’s first woman president. Yet Comey makes a good defence of his actions, showing how he was repeatedly confronted with a series of lose-lose choices. On the late October disclosure that the email probe was active again, he writes that he faced two doors: one marked Speak, the other Conceal. Had he failed to reveal that investigators were looking anew at Clinton’s emails, and had she been elected, Americans could justifiably argue that they had not voted in full possession of the facts. The FBI’s silence would have rendered Clinton an illegitimate president. (You can imagine what the Fox-Republican complex would have done with such a revelation.)Even those who follow Comey’s logic – and most readers will, I suspect, conclude that his motives were pure – are likely to struggle nonetheless with the other crucial decision he took in 2016. If disclosure was right for Hillary, why was it not right for Trump? Why did the FBI not announce that it was also looking at Trump’s possible collusion with Russia? Here Comey’s reasoning is much less persuasive. He explains that the TrumpRussia investigation was at a much earlier stage, that they did not want to tip off possible suspects and so on. But given the stakes, and the consequences, it’s not really good enough.The truth is, and Comey admits as much, he and others, including Barack Obama, were swayed by their assumption that Clinton was cruising to victory. That led Obama to keep back what he knew about Russian meddling in the election: why undermine Americans’ faith in their democracy when those Russian efforts were apparently making so little difference? And that same assumption shaped Comey’s decisions: he allowed himself to be more worried by questions of future public faith in a Clinton victory than by the risk that his actions might derail that outcome.The Trump win and what followed provides the material for the book’s most riveting chapters. Comey has a keen eye and his observations of Trump and his enablers are sharp. He shows us attorney general Jeff Sessions, for example, under pressure, eyes down, darting from left to right. But it’s Trump we’ve paid to see.Comey cannot disguise his loathing for the man, and the portrait he paints could not be uglier. He has Trump speaking in monologue, leaving no space for anyone else to say a word, a silence the new president takes as assent and complicity. Trump is ignorant – he blanks at Comey’s use of the word “calligrapher” – incurious and casually dishonest. And his ego is unbound. When Comey attended Oval Office meetings with Obama or George W Bush, the president would take a seat with the rest of the group: primus inter pares. But Trump remains seated behind his big desk, as if on a throne attended by courtiers. Comey puts that down to insecurity. A more confident man would not need to demonstrate his status so crudely.Comey records such details throughout, noting who has emotional intelligence and who lacks it. He describes “the Washington listen”: not so much listening as waiting for your turn to speak. And he offers some fascinating observations on presidential humour. Bush could crack a joke, but it was usually at someone else’s expense. Obama laughed easily and never once used humour as a putdown. Trump, meanwhile, never laughs, not even once: to do so would require acknowledging the existence, and successful conversational play, of another person.If the book has a hero besides Comey, it is Obama. A one-time registered Republican, Comey is bowled over by the Democrat who made him head of the FBI. In Obama he sees the wisdom and human sensitivity he aspires to himself. He recalls how, at a reception to mark Comey’s appointment, Obama posed for a photograph with Comey, his wife, the couple’s two daughters and their then boyfriends. At one point, Obama gestured to the boyfriends and said, “Hey, why don’t we take another without the guys. You know, just in case.” It was done playfully, but it was also wise. With all that must weigh on a president’s mind, he nevertheless had room to imagine the awkwardness such a photo could cause several decades later.In Comey’s telling, Obama was something of a saint in the swamp. Obama valued what Comey himself cherished and regarded as near-sacred: the independence of US institutions and, more important still, the obligation to tell the truth.There was a time when we might have teased such a man, mocking him as an earnest altar boy. But we don’t have that luxury now. In today’s world, truth has become a precious commodity and those ready to risk their careers to defend it are few and far between. Comey may be self-righteous, but in 2018 and given the alternatives, that has come to look like a rather tolerable vice.• A Higher Loyalty by James Comey is published by Macmillan (£20).

His affair with advertising began as Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi’s first finance directorSorrell made his first step toward global domination at the age of 40, investing in a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets called Wire \u0026amp Plastic ProductsSorrell announces himself on the global stage by buying J Walter Thompson, the world’s oldest ad agency and an iconic US brand for $566m.

He stepped down on 14 April“Sir Martin Sorrell’s resignation comes at a time when the company is already facing a number of operational challenges and introduces uncertainty over the strategy and ultimately the structure of the group going forward,” said Azzi.Moody’s said that WPP was already weakly positioned before Sorrell’s departure, performing significantly below its peers such as the US groups Omincom and IPG and the French firm Publicis.WPP’s board meeting, the first not to include its founder and chief executive in years, was expected to include Mark Read and Andrew Scott, the senior executives promoted to run the company day-to-day during the search for a new chief executive. They are also considered the two leading internal candidates.The board member Sol Trujillo, a former chief of companies including the French telecoms firm Orange and Australia’s Telstra, is understood to have been one of the most vocal about the issue of succession at WPP.A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of the publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and WPP’s ad agency JWT Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, the Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network.Sorrell has said he was available to assist with the transition.The 73-year old has “unreservedly denied” misconduct allegations and WPP’s board has said it would not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm.The influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis said it would prefer WPP to publish the report but that it accepted this was unlikely to happen.“In the interests of transparency, we would prefer if the report was made available to shareholders, though we view that outcome as unlikely,” said Martin Mortell, Glass Lewis UK \u0026amp Europe’s director of research. “Some investors may be willing to forego transparency in lieu of achieving overdue change at the top and the opportunity of a new strategic vision.”Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said there was a “real lack of transparency” and “any investigations done by the company should be made public”.

Passengers dragged the unidentified woman back in as the sudden decompression of the cabin pulled her partway through the opening. One person died and seven others were injured in the incident. The pilot of the plane, a twin-engine Boeing 737 bound from New York to Dallas with 149 people onboard, took it into a rapid descent and made an emergency landing in Philadelphia as oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and passengers braced for impact.The National Transportation Safety Board’s chairman, Robert Sumwalt, said one person died, the first passenger fatality in an accident involving a US airline since 2009. He gave no details, but the woman who nearly got sucked out was the only one seriously injured and was taken off the plane by emergency workers. The person who died was identified by her children’s school as Jennifer Riordan, a bank executive and mother of two from New Mexico. In an email to parents, assistant principal Amy McCarty of Albuquerque Catholic school, wrote: “The family needs all the prayers we can offer.” Photos posted by passengers showed a heavily damaged window near the damaged engine. In audio recording of the exchange with air traffic controllers, the crew member is heard to say the plane needs to slow down and an unidentified crew member reports that there is a hole in the plane and “someone went out”.“I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,” said Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York. “And the thoughts that were going through my head, of course, were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again.”Bourman said she was seated near the back of the plane and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask. Some passengers were in tears and others shouted words of encouragement.“You had a few passengers that were very strong,” she said, “and they kept yelling to people, you know: ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this.’”Another passenger, Marty Martinez, did a brief Facebook Live posting while wearing an oxygen mask. He posted: “Something is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!” After the plane landed, he posted photos of a damaged window near the engine.Bourman said everyone started shouting to brace for impact when the plane started to land. Everyone clapped and praised the pilot after he set the aircraft down.Bourman said she also saw a man in a cowboy hat rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.The Philadelphia fire commissioner, Adam Thiel, said passengers had done “some pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances”.Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed flight 1380 was heading west over New York’s southern tier at about 32,200ft and traveling at 500mph when it abruptly turned toward Philadelphia.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one involved in Tuesday’s emergency landing. It is the world’s largest operator of the 737. The Boeing 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, said investigators would take the Southwest engine apart to understand what happened and would look at maintenance records for the engine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d98d14d75f2f9e1c376153af65a5407844564327/1184_1499_6479_3886/master/6479.jpg?w=6250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e99d4abd1035401f8f6e9db394397c 12500w","title":"the ghost streets of 1960s birmingham in pictures janet mendelsohn richard p rogers","story":"In 1968, American photographers Janet Mendelsohn and Richard P.

But many more are suffering from the ‘hostile environment’ Theresa May createdAfter five months of shocking revelations about the treatment of Windrush generation citizens, the UK government has apologised. This dramatic and welcome U-turn is nonetheless too little, too late. Lives have been wrecked. Members of a generation who arrived at Britain’s invitation – proffered not from generosity, but because their labour was needed – spent decades working and paying taxes. Then their jobs were snatched away, their homes lost, their treatment for cancer withheld. At least two were sent to detention centres and\u0026nbspthreatened with removal to countries they left 50\u0026nbspyears ago, as children.Legally, they have every right to remain. But, as the Guardian has exposed in a series of stories, an increasingly harsh immigration regime abruptly required them to justify their presence by producing decades-old paperwork. Now it emerges that officials actually destroyed landing cards which could have helped support their cases, despite warnings from staff.Until now, the government has been dismissive when challenged over this scandal. The prime minister refused to intervene when it emerged that one man was being denied radiotherapy unless he could pay a £54,000 bill upfront. Downing Street initially snubbed Caribbean countries’ request for a meeting to address the problem. As outrage over the grotesque injustice grew, the home secretary made an unusually forthright apology in the House of Commons on Monday. Amber Rudd described her own department’s actions as “appalling”. A new taskforce has been created and is supposed to resolve cases within two weeks. Application fees will be waived. On Tuesday Theresa May went further, promising compensation to anyone left out of pocket many have lost work and benefits and face daunting legal bills.The toll has not been merely material. Jobs and homes are part of people’s identities. The stress and trauma are likely to engender an enduring sense of insecurity in those who never previously doubted that this was their home. And the fear reverberates far and wide. Most immediately, these cases fuel concern over how EU citizens will be treated after Brexit. Others are already suffering, with families cruelly split by complex income requirements, an illogical and inflexible policing of other rules and frequently by official mistakes (for which iniduals pay, with expensive applications, appeals and legal fees).Though Mrs May says she is “genuinely sorry” about the anxiety of Windrush citizens, this is not a\u0026nbspmatter of random administrative errors but part of a systematic issue created by her choices. As\u0026nbsphome secretary, she boasted of creating a “really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants. This\u0026nbspwas the necessary concomitant to the arbitrary cap upon immigration. Setting a number, rather than establishing principles, led officials to focus on keeping out or removing as many people as possible, instead of handling cases fairly, equitably and humanely. Setting a number so unrealistically low – and including overseas students, reportedly at Mrs\u0026nbspMay’s insistence  – means that it has not been met seven years later, even with this punitive approach.Scrapping the “go home” vans (under legal pressure) and changing terminology (the home office now prefers the Orwellian euphemism “compliant” to hostile) were cosmetic measures. The government pursues the same course with a disastrous mixture of grim determination and incompetence. The vote for Brexit was read as a legitimisation of this hard line – or, more cynically, a spur to pursuing it as a political strategy. The Windrush scandal is the result: “If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas, and that is what has happened with this far-right rhetoric in this country,” the Labour MP David Lammy told parliament.When Mrs May first spoke of a hostile environment, she presented it as a matter of fairness: making sure that all abided by the same rules. But treating people as guilty until proved innocent, making mistakes at the cost of those applying, and handling lives so callously sits oddly with the sense of decency and fair play so often claimed as inherently British – whether those involved arrived from the Commonwealth half\u0026nbspa century ago, or much more recently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a094e63bba2c9bb70f0dde657e9adf84972d33fe/0_0_650_392/master/650.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f355469e40978c0c2846133e8a0e36 700w","title":"shawn mendes webchat interview","story":"The 19-year-old pop star answered your questions about his pre-show routines, how he deals with stress and anxiety, and what he likes to rock out toHey guys, thank you so much for submitting all of your wonderful questions.

Could Oxford and Cambridge universities opt to break free from state control and go private?The government launched its review of post-18 education in February. With the Tories keen to woo young voters, following Jeremy Corbyn’s commitment to end tuition fees, a reduction of the £9,250 fees cap is widely expected. But vice-chancellors say quality could be threatened if the government does not plug any gap with new funding.Unlike other universities, Oxford and Cambridge say fees, even at £9,250, do not cover the costs of the tutorial-led teaching for which they are famous. A spokesperson for Cambridge would not comment about going private, but said each student costs an average of £18,500 a year to teach.It has been on the cards since the\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbsppromised a major review of funding across tertiary education in their election manifesto. With graduate debt running at £50,000 upwards, there has been growing concern about the cost of going to university and whether it represents value for money. Fees in the UK are among the highest in the world, and some doubt there will be a return on such a huge investment in terms of graduate earnings.The government is\u0026nbsppromising a wide-ranging review\u0026nbspof the whole of post-18 education and funding, including the ide between vocational and academic qualifications and the decline in lifelong and part-time study. Most of the interest will be in undergraduate tuition fees, which stand at a hefty £9,250 a year at all but a handful of universities.The government will not seek to match\u0026nbspLabour’s promise to axe tuition fees\u0026nbspaltogether, which the Conservatives regard as unaffordable and regressive. The review could recommend cutting or freezing fees. One of the most controversial options is the introduction of variable fees for different courses, depending on the cost of putting a course on, potential graduate earnings and the economic value to the country. So some universities might for example cut their fees for social science and humanities courses, which generally attract lower graduate earnings than engineering or maths.Not very. With the review set to run for a year, reporting in early 2019, the government has been accused of kicking the issue into the long grass. If you are applying to start university this September, nothing will have substantially changed.If they declared themselves independent, they could set their own fees and not have to endure state regulation, which requires them to prove the quality of their research – and what they do with it – plus that of their teaching and the amount their graduates earn.Matt Robb, of EY-Parthenon, a consultancy that advises universities, says: “Oxford and Cambridge are currently in the top five institutions in the world. If that status were threatened by loss of funding or other factors, and this was the only solution, I think they wouldn’t blink in pushing to go private.”Some experts argue that this could solve a conundrum for ministers, who want to cut fees but don’t want to damage two such stellar British brands.Butler adds that other elite universities might follow. A senior Oxbridge college figure agrees: “It would really only work if Oxford and Cambridge, Imperial College London, UCL, Kings College London and the LSE all went together.”Speculation about what the top two could charge students varies, but several insiders suggest around £15,000. They insist this would allow Oxbridge to follow Harvard University and offer “needs blind” admissions. One academic manager says: “Perhaps just one third of students might pay the actual sticker price.” But such high fees would still stir up huge controversy.Lord Butler says: “I think the government might be anxious that independent universities would become like private schools and would be largely confined to the well off. However, that needn’t be the case as universities with strong brands could ensure that access could be completely means tested, with bursaries for families who could not afford the fees.”However Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “If they walk away from the regulatory system they are basically the same as private schools. No one chases Eton hard about needs-blind admissions.” If admissions were scrupulously fair, the private universities would be less likely to spend as much time and money on going into state schools and searching for talented students, he says.“People often talk about admissions in America in a very positive light, but although there are needs-blind admissions, Ivy League universities also give places to the children of donors and alumni. Part of moulding a class is handpicking the wealthy.”Money is not the only driver behind the latest rumblings. There is also resentment about the government’s drive to treat students as consumers and to assess the value universities offer them.Stephen Toope, Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, blogged last month: “For a generation now, politicians of all stripes have talked as if UK universities are broken, and hence in need of ‘market discipline’. They talk as if our students, smart and energetic people, are in need of protection. This is an own goal.”Another vice-chancellor, who has asked not to be named, says: “We are seeing a real threat to institutional autonomy from ministers. I think right now we must be the closest we’ve ever been to a point where Oxford and Cambridge will turn round and say, ‘Sod this, we are fed up with being criticised, we’ll go private’.”But many in the sector think this is a leap too far. Prof Simon Marginson, director of the centre for global higher education at UCL’s Institute of Education, agrees that deregulation is one “obvious answer” for Oxford and Cambridge, but says that changing the relationship between universities and the state would be hugely problematic.“In political terms, giving these universities what they want is the opposite of what the government needs to do at the moment,” he says. “It needs to show it is supporting poor people, not elite universities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8643bf938fc699015df8582adc50158a1d896ada/237_351_1549_1496/master/1549.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9cdda38579d1134079c960dd065fe971 2020w","title":"brighton tottenham premier league match report","story":"It was on this day last year that Brighton ensured their promotion from the Championship. On Tuesday night at the Amex Stadium they took a small step towards retaining their Premier League status for another season.The fiendish nature of their run-in has been well-documented and Chris Hughton’s team must still face the Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Burnley in their final matches. They needed something, anything, to allow them to breathe a little easily after a worrying run of one point from an available 15. This was it.The horror of Saturday’s 3-2 defeat at Crystal Palace was forgotten as Brighton put their bodies on the line to earn precious reward. The roar from the home crowd at the full-time whistle told its own story. Brighton are eight points clear of third-from-bottom Southampton, although they have played a game more.Tottenham have a bigger match round the corner in the shape of Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United and Mauricio Pochettino appeared to have one eye on it with his team selection. He made six changes from Saturday’s home defeat by Manchester City and omitted Davinson Sánchez and Dele Alli from the squad entirely. He gave Toby Alderweireld his first Premier League action since 28 October and the centre-half was not overly extended.However, Pochettino made the point yet again that the league was the priority. The personnel changes, he said, were purely down to fatigue from the City game. “If we win the FA Cup, we are not going to play Champions League,” Pochettino said. “You only do that if you finish in the top four. Today was the most important game.”For Tottenham it felt like points dropped. Pochettino was entitled to say that his team had “dominated” the game in terms of possession and territory but he was also on the money when he lamented a “lack of aggression” in the final third. They were unable to create sufficient clear-cut chances.Harry Kane put Spurs in front with his 26th goal of the Premier League season – his Golden Boot rival, Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, has 30 – but Brighton showed their strength of character with an instant riposte through Pascal Gross’s penalty. Hughton had given him the responsibility after a couple of penalty misses this season by Glenn Murray.Tottenham’s lead over fifth-placed Chelsea could be cut to five points with four matches to play when their London rivals go to Burnley on Thursday. But theirs remains a position of strength. Three of their final four matches are at Wembley – against Watford, Newcastle and Leicester – and the other one is a trip to West Brom.Pochettino’s team sought to impose their pressing game and they sparked danger on a number of occasions when they forced errors from Brighton high up the pitch. Gross was guilty of the stray pass that set in motion the move for Kane’s goal at the beginning of the second half.He put Gaëtan Bong in trouble, the left-back was tackled by Victor Wanyama and, when the ball broke, Son Heung-min tried to run round Lewis Dunk on the byline. Son did not look to have the room but he benefited from the spin of the ball, which remained on the right side of the line, and the alarm bells sounded when Kane swooped. He crashed home from close range.Brighton’s response was impressive. José Izquierdo got away from Serge Aurier inside the box following Murray’s touch and the Tottenham right-back’s attempt to rectify the situation was clumsy. Izquierdo felt the contact and went down. Gross’s penalty was too powerful for Hugo Lloris.The first half had been end-to-end without too many thrills in front of goal. Son, who menaced Bruno, the Brighton right-back and captain, had the clearest chance in the third minute of stoppage-time. Taking a flick from Kane, he eked out a yard of space before shooting for the bottom corner. Mathew Ryan thrust out a hand to save smartly.Set pieces had seemed the likeliest route to the breakthrough. The tension inside the ground was palpable when Christian Eriksen and Kane stood over free-kicks on the edge of the Brighton area on 11 and 44 minutes respectively, but neither could convert. The awards had followed loose passes from Beram Kayal and Anthony Knockaert.At the other end Dunk rose to direct a towering header at goal from Gross’s 19th minute corner and Anthony Knockaert almost applied the decisive touch in front of Lloris. Knockaert was a willing and pacy outlet and he worked Lloris with a deflected shot while Murray could not muster sufficient power in his flick after slick work from Gross. Ryan also had to be alert to tip over a long ranger from Lucas Moura.Tottenham pushed for the winner in the second half, with Pochettino introducing Mousa Dembélé and Erik Lamela, but Brighton’s resolve was fierce. Their support endured a few flutters, not least when Eriksen fizzed in a cross-cum-shot and Shane Duffy erted the ball inches past the far post, while Lamela was denied by Ryan. Hughton’s battlers had done enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac9ad34ac93f83d339538dac8b59a0e8a911d59/66_27_1416_850/master/1416.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=10d60632ee84b086cb820778803012eb 1240w","title":"everton fans assess sam allardyce abilities manager zero hero","story":"• Respondents asked to mark questions on scale of zero to 10• Manager again barracked in Saturday’s lifeless draw at SwanseaEverton have sent a survey to season-ticket holders and club members asking them to rate Sam Allardyce’s ability to “get the best out of the team” on a scale of zero to 10.The question about the team manager is part of a wide-ranging survey designed to shape the club’s engagement strategy with supporters. A questionnaire has been emailed to members of the fans’ panel seeking opinions on the direction of the club, match-day experience, the team and the senior management at Goodison Park.On Allardyce supporters are asked to rate his performance on the basis of: “I have a high level of trust in the current manager and coaching staff of Everton eg, in making the right decisions to get the best out of the team.” Ratings range from zero – “completely disagree” – to 10 – “completely agree”.The survey also asks fans to rate their trust in Everton players “being loyal and performing at their best” and the club’s leadership in “making the right decisions for the club’s future”. Belief in the direction of the club, whether or not Everton are portrayed fairly by the media and how strongly fans feel connected to the club are additional questions.Everton have endured a dreadful season having embarked on the biggest spending spree in their history last summer and, while the club’s reversal predates Allardyce’s appointment in November, Ronald Koeman’s successor as manager has attracted fierce criticism. Allardyce was again barracked by Evertonians during the 1-1 draw at Swansea City on Saturday and, despite planning for next season and being under contract until 2019, doubt surrounds his position at Goodison.The club sent the same questions to the panel at the end of last season in response to the Premier League reducing the range of questions in their fans’ survey.

Similarly agents are prohibited from having “a material influence” over the affairs of a club.Last summer Wolves confirmed that the club’s owner since July 2016, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun, does own a stake in Mendes’s company, Gestifute. “Fosun have a percentage stake in the Gestifute company headed up by Jorge Mendes,” the club said.Having acquired the stake in Mendes’s agency in January 2016, the Chinese owner “canvassed advice” from Mendes before buying Wolves six months later, the club’s managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, said on Sky TV this week. Since the takeover Mendes has been involved in recruitment as the manager of his longstanding client Nuno Espírito Santo and Portuguese players who have transformed the quality of the Wolves squad.Public disclosures have stated the stake is owned by Shanghai Foyo, a company majority owned by the Fosun chairman, Guo Guangchang. Gestifute and Shanghai Foyo have since January 2016 been involved in a joint agency and marketing venture in Chinese football the launch in Shanghai was attended by Mendes and officials from Benfica and Monaco, where Mendes has been highly influential.The EFL has said it believes the rules have been complied with after Wolves gave undertakings and put “appropriate arrangements in place” following Fosun’s takeover from Steve Morgan in July 2016.Wolves are compiling a further written explanation of Mendes’s position for the EFL, following complaints last month by the Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani. He tweeted during Leeds’ 3-0 defeat by Wolves: “Not legal and fair to let one team owned by a fund who has shares in the biggest players’ agency with evident benefits (top European clubs giving players with options to buy) … why the other 23 teams can’t have the same treatment?”Radrizzani followed that with a letter to the FA, EFL and Premier League seeking clarification of Wolves’ relationship with Mendes. He told the BBC that when he was preparing to buy Leeds last year, he sold his shares in an agency, on advice from his lawyer: “I did because obviously there is a conflict of interest and I always pay attention to staying within the rules.”Dalrymple confirmed this week that Mendes “has advised us on players we have taken but equally he has advised us on players we have not continued to take” and that: “There are some players that are connected with him who have come in and done a really good job for us.”Despite that acknowledgment, and widespread reporting that the standout signing from Porto, Rúben Neves, and other Portuguese recruits, are Mendes clients, neither Mendes nor Gestifute is declared as any of the players’ agents on the FA’s record of Wolves’ signings published this month.Neves signed for Wolves for £15.8m in the summer his agent, recorded in the FA’s document based on filings by Wolves, was another Portuguese intermediary, Jorge Pires Serralheiro. The same agent acted for other young Portuguese players signed by Wolves who are commonly cited as Mendes clients: Pedro Gonçalves, Rúben Vinagre and Boubacar Hanne. The midfielder Diogo Jota, 21, who has excelled on loan from Atlético Madrid, was represented by a Spanish agent, Carlos Bucero Gómez, according to the FA’s document.Gestifute appears only once as an agent in the signings Wolves are recorded to have made last summer: another Gestifute director, Andy Quinn, an accountant based in Dublin, is stated to have acted for Wolves when Jota was signed.Those signings followed the acquisitions the previous year of other Portuguese players, including Hélder Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro and João Teixeira, who were represented by a lawyer, Carlos Osório de Castro, or an agent, Valdir Cardoso, understood to do work for Gestifute.A Wolves spokesman said neither Serralheiro nor Bucero was associated with Mendes or Gestifute. The club has consistently played down Mendes’s influence. Dalrymple, despite confirming the signing of players “connected” to Mendes, described him again this week as an adviser and close friend to the chairman, Jeff Shi, who “can use him as a sounding board”.Wolves are “still completely comfortable with their position,” Dalrymple said, and will provide the same information to the Premier League as they have given to the EFL and FA.“We don’t believe, and I don’t believe the authorities believe, that we’ve stepped outside the rules,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65f676da3c33daa5ea13a5503b6c2cccf5bc364/0_547_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d52132ac0838201978989a0f677b89cb 1240w","title":"held back from promotion too honest","story":"Have you got a work-related problem?

On Monday the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz told Hannity: “I want to say that I really think that you should have disclosed your relationship with Cohen when you talked about him on this show.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77269941a9e027b36dbb7a3de45604e3ac8dc92/130_1002_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dde7b3773d9a6b558288ecf20be4512a 2600w","title":"netflixs new world order a streaming giant on the brink of global domination","story":"The online entertainment company, which boasts 125 million subscribers, has become so powerful it can even afford to snub Cannes. Are cinephiles – and conventional broadcasters – right to fear for the future?At the Berlin film festival last February, Clare Binns took her seat for the premiere of a Spanish film that was generating a quiet buzz. She hoped it might play at Picturehouse Cinemas, the British chain of cinemas she runs. In the film, La Enfermedad del Domingo (Sunday’s Illness), an abandoned daughter confronts her well-to-do mother in a remote mountain village. The film’s director, Ramón Salazar, has a knack for epic melodrama that has drawn comparisons with the work of Pedro Almodóvar.“It was a fantastic film, and one that is made to be seen in cinema,” says Binns. “But it was only when I was sitting there watching it that I noticed the logo.”Alongside the name of the film’s Spanish production company, there rose the ubiquitous – and increasingly isive – mark of Netflix. The streaming giant, which this week announced it has more than 125 million global subscribers, had financed the film. Binns immediately knew this drastically reduced her chances of getting anywhere near it. “We went straight to the producer to try to work out a way – in Spain, they are doing a theatrical release – but Netflix didn’t want to do anything else,” she adds.Instead, Netflix will add La Enfermedad del Domingo to its dizzying carousel of content in June, where users may enjoy it at home. “I don’t object to Netflix as a business,” says Binns, who is a subscriber herself. “But for a film like that to show just on a platform and not the big screen is just so depressing. It’s a disgrace.”Binns’ feelings echo an epic tussle in the global film and TV industries. Last week, a spat between Netflix and the European cinema establishment erupted a month before the Cannes film festival. The company, which declined to answer questions, only occasionally shows its movies in handfuls of cinemas, partly to make them eligible for awards. Even then, the films are made available for home viewing at the same time, a sacrilege in the world of cinema. Now the industry fears for the future of a business model – and an art form.Last week, Ted Sandaros, the chief content officer at Netflix, breezily announced that Netflix would skip Cannes rather than show films out of competition. The festival had “set the tone”, he told Variety. “We are choosing to be about the future of cinema. If Cannes is choosing to be stuck in the history of cinema, that’s fine.”Cultural chasms have opened along the Croisette before, but this time the old guard is facing a rapidly evolving digital beast that can afford to dismiss the most prestigious festival in the business. Sandaros was so relaxed withdrawing that he found time to needle Frémaux. After the festival chief had also banned selfies on the Cannes red carpet (they “tarnish the quality and tempo of the ascending of the steps”), Sandaros wondered “what other advances in media Frémaux would like to address”.But to what extent is Netflix’s tightening grip on our screens irresistible, and how does the company’s culture – built around its sage-like founder and CEO, Reed Hastings – explain its success? Because, apart from the protectionist cries of cinephiles, Netflix is facing a coming onslaught from new- and old-world rivals. Streaming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Apple, are investing fast, while – perhaps most significantly – Disney is pulling its own content from Netflix before its planned launch of a rival streaming platform late next year.“He is why I wanted to write the book,” Keating says of Hastings. “I had watched him consistently make call after call that nobody on Wall Street thought were good ideas – and he just knew. He just didn’t care when his share price tanked and I’d never seen a CEO like that.” Keating says the data Netflix has amassed – what its viewers like, how long they watch, when they watch – is “everything”. She adds: “They constantly have a finger on the pulse, and the demand curve that they have observed allows them to project into the future in a way that I don’t know anyone in any other industry can do … I just don’t think anybody knew what effect this model would have on how that content is created.”Gareth Neame has watched that transformation during more than 20 years in British television, having worked at both the BBC and independent production companies. He commissioned series including Spooks, State of Play and Hustle. In terms of funding, he says, “one way or another, a producer usually got to about £1m an hour”.The model shifted again when Netflix and others began bulk-buying content to satisfy its subscribers. Producers had yet another revenue stream and they began financing shows in anticipation of a streaming deal, pushing budgets and quality higher still. This increased Netflix’s subscriptions – and its own spending power once it began making its own shows. (The Crown, made for Netflix by the British production company Left Bank Pictures, has a budget of more than £10m an episode.) The centre of gravity has shifted and, for TV and film-makers, Netflix has become an attractive home.In 2015, BBC Two and BBC America showed the first series of The Last Kingdom, a big-budget drama based on Bernard Cornwell’s Saxon Stories. Neame had made it for the BBC, but Netflix came calling and found the show an enthusiastic global audience. “The first season didn’t break through on BBC America, but it did on Netflix in the US,” Neame says. So Netflix replaced BBC America for the second series, co-producing it with the BBC and Carnival. This month, Carnival announced that the third series of The Last Kingdom will be an exclusive production for Netflix. “Their mission seems to be to back storytellers and let them get on with it,” Neame says.For fledgling film-makers, that support can often be the difference between making a film and not. For years, Adam Randall, a British director, struggled to find funding for iBoy, a sci-fi teen thriller adapted from a 2010 young adult novel. By 2015, he and his producer had raised just $600,000. Then Netflix got hold of the script. “We got on the phone in early 2016 and an hour later they were on board,” Randall says. “They raised the budget to roughly $1.5m.”iBoy, released on Netflix in January last year, was the first British Netflix Original film. Had he made it without Netflix, with half the budget, Randall thinks the film, a London-set genre piece for teens, might have struggled to win the interest of distributors or festivals. “To get to a young audience with Netflix was perfect and it has been seen by a much wider international audience than I could ever have hoped for,” he says.Disney’s streaming service, for which it is making Star Wars TV shows, appears to set the studio against Netflix in an epic battle for eyeballs, not least after its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox. But not every industry observer sees it that way. “The reality is that Amazon, Hulu and even Apple are already further along than Disney,” says Rich Greenfield, a Silicon Valley analyst at San Francisco trading firm BTIG. “I think it’s a highly entrepreneurial culture that’s about a willingness to sacrifice near-term profits to win long-term.” Legacy media companies have neither the stomach nor culture to truly take on that fight, Greenfield believes.Nor do they have Netflix’s data, which will require a big additional investment in old-school marketing for Disney and others. And Netflix is big in that game, too. In January, the company said it would increase its marketing budget to $2bn. This month, it was reported that Netflix is bidding more than $300m for a billboard company in the heart of Hollywood. The reported move, which neither party commented on, appeared to reflect Netflix’s rampant growth strategy – but also the devil-may-care attitude that was evident in Cannes.“If it’s true, it would seem to confirm the idea in Hollywood that Netflix is taking over the world,” Keating says of the billboard ploy. The company’s culture has been an object of speculation for years, fuelled in part by its publication, in 2009, of a “freedom and responsibility” slide show for would-be employees (in January, the company had 5,500 employees globally). Last year, it updated and shortened the document, setting itself apart from the Silicon Valley archetype of free lunches and ping-pong tables with a tougher, more grownup atmosphere. Managers frequently judge teams against a “keeper test” if Jim, say, were planning to leave, would you fight to keep him? If not, employees are “promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package”. “They describe themselves as being like a pro sports team,” Keating adds.Several former Netflix employees declined to contribute to this article. But where will Netflix’s win-at-all-costs mentality take it – and audiences? Hastings himself has committed only to doing more of the same, but many watchers see an eventual route into live TV, news and sports broadcasting as streaming services continue to grind down old broadcasters and channels. Netflix and other streaming services will become TV as we know it. “I also think we’ll see more experimentation with virtual reality and user-generated plot twists,” Keating says, pointing out the advantages a tech-first company would have in doing so.In the meantime, Netflix has work to do if it wants to make friends in the industries it is shaking up. The company’s logo may not be featuring at Cannes next month, but its executives will be there, buying yet more content. “I think everyone is frightened about the new world order,” says Binns at Picturehouse Cinemas, who will also be at the festival. “I just hope people start to recognise that we need to be talking to each other and working out a way of making sure we’re not killing the cinema.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kendrick lamar has brought pop to pulitzer","story":"By becoming the first non-classical or jazz winner of the Pulitzer prize for music, the rapper has created US history – appropriate, given his unwavering gaze at American lifePerhaps the most obvious question provoked by the news that Kendrick Lamar has been awarded the Pulitzer prize for music for his 2017 album Damn is not “why?” but rather “what took you so long?”It has been 60 years since the birth of modern pop music, a period of time during which said modern pop music has established itself, in its multifarious configurations, as being an unquestionably important art form. Clearly no one expected an august institution like the Pulitzer to start handing out gongs to the Backstreet Boys or Mötley Crüe, but the notion that not a single work by any American pop artist over the last seven decades has been thought worthy is mind-boggling. They gave an “additional citation” to Bob Dylan in 2008, and to Hank Williams in 2010 – a mere 57 years after the latter’s death – but the prize itself has remained almost exclusively the domain of classical music. In its history, there have only been three jazz winners: Wynton Marsalis in 1997, Ornette Coleman in 2006, and Henry Threadgill in 2016.Then again, the Pulitzer has a longstanding reputation for being quite extraordinarily stuffy. The most celebrated example of its snobbery may have come in 1965, when the jury decided that no current music was worthy of an award, and attempted instead to give a special citation to Duke Ellington, in recognition of the groundbreaking body of work he had amassed over the preceding 50 years. Not, one would have imagined, a particularly controversial decision: by 1965, Ellington was rightly regarded as a straight-up, no-further-questions genius who had elevated jazz to an orchestral art form worthy of comparison with more “respectable” musical genres decades before. But the Pulitzer board refused to give out the award. Indeed, it wasn’t until 1996 that an African American, George Walker, won the prize itself. In 2004, then Pulitzer administrator Sig Gissler said they would be “broadening the prize a bit” so it could be awarded to music not from the European classical tradition it no longer became obligatory for entrants to submit a score. Even so, there was no mention of pop music in their idea of what constituted “distinguished American musical compositions”. The official announcement of the new policy involved everything but: “The contemporary classical symphony to jazz, opera, choral, musical theatre, movie scores and other forms of musical excellence.”This clearly makes Kendrick Lamar’s achievement all the more striking in its break with the prize’s dusty traditions. This year’s award hasn’t gone to some rarefied piece of electronica with classical pretensions, but to a double platinum-selling hip-hop album by an artist who packs out arena venues. Still, if you were going to pick a contemporary pop artist to storm the Pulitzer’s barricades, Lamar is an obvious choice.They’ve chosen someone both at the top of his game and at the forefront of a post-Ferguson renaissance in righteously angry, politically engaged black music that genuinely bears comparison to soul music’s revered early 1970s golden era. Furthermore, he’s proved that it is possible to make a huge mainstream impact with music that never panders to the lowest common denominator and never underestimates its audience’s intelligence. It is frequently complex, knotty, contradictory, claustrophobic and disjointed it regularly nods towards black music’s history – referencing everything from the lusciously soft soul of the Chi-Lites to Outkast’s psychedelic take on rap – but never feels comfortingly familiar. Perhaps the commercial success of such ostensibly uncommercial material is down to the fact Lamar makes music that perfectly reflects its era. He may have claimed that Damn represented a step back from the sociopolitical fury of its predecessor To Pimp a Butterfly, an album that ended up being lauded by the outgoing president of the United States – it even contained a backwards message complaining of “the pain in my heart carrying the burden for the struggle” – but Damn never shies away from addressing serious issues: black empowerment, protest, the Trump presidency, violence, inflammatory right-wing punditry. Anxious, scattered and disquieting, the musical backing sounds like living through 2017 frequently felt. You could argue long into the night about whether or not the approval of an institution like the Pulitzer prize is antithetical to the messages contained in Damn, but an award that’s frequently courted accusations of rarefied, snooty irrelevance could hardly have picked a more relevant and impactful album to give its approval to.• This article was amended on Tuesday 17 April, to add Wynton Marsalis and Henry Threadgill to the list of jazz winners of the Pulitzer prize for music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b366e2e9b3442cd6953687c11d976405cb01fbb5/78_7_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e2f44b0da0a3c0e433741525396a2983 1240w","title":"snail ballet dancers slow pixel elizabeth saint jalmes cyril leclerc","story":"Raised to be sauteed in garlic butter but freed by French vegetarian art anarchists, meet the unlikely stars of a mindful music performance Only minutes after meeting Elizabeth Saint-Jalmes and Cyril Leclerc at their Paris apartment, I’m invited into their darkened boudoir. Several snails are crawling on the floor next to the bed. Each has a little light-emitting diode attached to its shell that activates sensors on a nearby speaker designed by Elizabeth that is pumping out soothingly drone-like music composed by Cyril.What I’m witnessing is a teaser for a six-hour, 176-snail ballet called Slow Pixel that the two artists are bringing to London later this month for its UK premiere as part of Cryptic’s Sonica festival. For only £4.50, you can watch illuminated snails crawl around a darkened room to challenging music. Don’t tell me you’re not tempted.“These snails were raised to be eaten,” Elizabeth whispers. It’s striking how all three of us change our behaviour in this chambre des escargots – we speak more quietly, walk gingerly around the room (none of us want to hear the crunch of calcium carbonate shell) and find ourselves kneeling to get a closer view. We, as much as the snails, are performers in this ballet.Can you assure me, I whisper, that no gastropods were harmed in the making of this artwork? “Absolutely,” replies Elizabeth, thoughtfully placing one on my notebook, the better to illuminate my shorthand.She tells me that these eight snails, and the hundreds more she and Cyril keep in the cellar, are from the gastronomically prized species gros-gris (fat greys). “We are vegetarians and in a sense we have freed them from their destiny.” That destiny, most likely, was to be sauteed in garlic butter.Cyril produces a plant mister and sprays the snails with water. “They like humidity and showering them helps simulate that,” he says. Don’t the snails get stressed with diodes strapped to their shells? “Snails don’t get stressed,” he says. “Their heart rate is always 35 beats per minute. You know when they’re upset, though. They retreat into their shells.”Cyril, 43, and Elizabeth, 40, have been using snails in their art for eight years. Their first gastropod-based interventions involved feeding snails paper of different colours. Cyril recalls: “We would feed them red paper and they would shit red patterns. And if we fed them yellow and blue paper, what colour do you think they would shit?” Green? “Exactly.”The French couple’s art has an appealingly daffy, anti-commercial tenor. To clinch the point, Elizabeth takes a hunting horn from its case and blows a few notes so loud as to give any urban foxes in the 20th arrondissement the willies. Not to be outdone, Cyril starts strumming his tampura, an Indian stringed instrument often used to create droning, meditative effects. As I sit on the sofa drinking Japanese tea and snacking on cheese and nuts while they blow and strum, I wonder what the neighbours think.“We’re very much influenced by Fluxus,” says Elizabeth. That group of 60s artists, musicians, performers and even chefs often created art happenings involving chance, factors that provoked interactions between artist and audience. Elizabeth and Cyril’s work is neo-Fluxus, combining music, choreography and drawing, plus free-roaming snails.They hope to seduce visitors into a new relation with space and time. In a world where, as Parisian philosopher Paul Virilio has argued, technological change destroys space and compresses time, what a beguiling existential corrective it is to slow to a snail’s pace for a few hours. “Remember when you were a kid and you could sit and look at an insect for hours? Or watch a snail crawl across a path?” asks Elizabeth. Cyril hopes it will give visitors a Proustian rush, provoking bittersweet meditation on impermanence and lost time.During the performance, Elizabeth and Cyril place the light-bearing snails on the walls, creating effects that simulate the night sky or city lights. While the snails crawl up and down, the artists project video footage behind them shot from the window of the Trans-Siberian Express – as if to emphasise the difference between the human and gastropod pace of life. “What we both found amazing was how on the train, which actually only goes at about 80kmh, you can do nothing but eat, sleep and read – so your mind and body are in a different temporal relation to the world,” says Elizabeth. “That inspired much of what we’re thinking about with Slow Pixel.”Do many visitors stay for six hours? “It varies – some stay for just a few minutes,” says Elizabeth. “We insist only on one thing – people leave their phones outside.” They’ve both noticed how some visitors will try to smuggle their phones into the performance space, furtively taking selfies with snails.“It’s a shame when they do that, because we’re hoping to encourage mindfulness,” says Cyril. “Be in the moment, not always photographing it.” Such mindful art is a growing cultural tendency, embracing things from colouring books, to Rolf Hind’s opera Lost in Thought, to the TV shows that court viewers who want to get a real-time reindeer’s eye view of crossing the Arctic. “These can be immersive experiences for iniduals, liberating them from the everyday world,” says Elizabeth. “Just for a few hours.” Minutes later when I’m strap-hanging on the Métro, hurrying to catch the Eurostar home to meet a deadline, I realise these two French artists are right: us heedless humans have much to learn from the wisdom of snails.

Almost none of the staff there knew anything about political campaigning. A lot of what I said to them and what I presented to them was novel. They had never heard of any of these tactics. They had never participated in politics before, and openly said: ‘I work for an insurance company, so: help.’”Kaiser said she and a Cambridge Analytica colleague gave advice on how to improve the survey methodology. “I was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single inidual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current customer of Eldon Insurance or Go Skippy.”She added: “They had probably already been doing that around a month or two.”The disclosure raises further questions about comments made by Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s former communications director, in which he described how the campaign used insurance actuaries to identify prime locations for political campaigning.Wigmore told the Guardian that no actuaries had been employed by the campaign. Kaiser also told the committee that Banks set up a company called Big Data Dolphins, which she said was working with a data science team at the University of Mississippi, after he ceased negotiations with Cambridge Analytica. Kaiser questioned whether the data of British citizens “was sent abroad, specifically to Mississippi” for processing by Big Data Dolphins.Leave.EU attacked Kaiser’s evidence as “a confused litany of lies and allegations” and said that Eldon Insurance did not share data with anyone. “No data has been sent to Mississippi. The unit is still in the planning stage, it employs no one and is not operational,” the group said.An invoice of the same value was issued to Ukip, and Banks told the Observer that he had made a donation to the party to cover the cost of the bill. However, Ukip said it never paid Cambridge Analytica. It is unclear whether the invoice was ever settled.Kaiser also told the committee she had seen documents in which Nigel Oakes, the co-founder of the SCL Group, and the head of its defence ision, revealed the company’s audience-targeting methodology was for several years “export-controlled by the British government”.“That would mean that the methodology was considered a weapon,” she said. “Weapons-grade communications tactics – which means we had to tell the British government if that was going to be deployed in another country outside the United Kingdom.” She said the designation from the UK government was removed in 2015.Among the documents provided to the committee by Kaiser is a legal opinion drafted in support of a proposal for Ukip to share data with Cambridge Analytica.One of the authors of that opinion, Philip Coppel QC, last month represented Cambridge Analytica in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) from obtaining a warrant to raid the company’s premises.Kaiser’s testimony also threatens to raise further questions for Facebook after she said that far more people than previously understood may have had their data harvested from the site.Lawyers for Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica who was suspended from his position last month, told the committee that he would not appear because he was a subject in an active ICO investigation.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80eed0716406710752fd421e0a3c27eaeeb1f687/32_0_1548_929/master/1548.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ea1cfd2234556de2ad025c274796aa0b 1240w","title":"may revels as tory mps shout down trigger shy syria sissy corbyn","story":"Parliament agrees with the prime minister that she only needs its approval for a really big warAfter the war-war, the jaw-jaw. Which was precisely what Jeremy Corbyn was so concerned about. Though the Labour leader was deeply grateful to the prime minister for sparing six hours of her time on a ministerial statement and a token debate the previous evening, he would rather the government hadn’t presented the Syrian strikes as a fait accompli to parliament.Not that many MPs seemed to care that much. They were all jaw-jawed out and had got bored with the war-war. It had been standing room only during Monday’s proceedings, but the chamber was less than half full for the emergency debate on whether the government should have consulted parliament before Saturday’s attack.Even so, there were more than enough Tory backbenchers – for whom there is no greater crime than being a trigger-shy sissy – to jeer and shout Corbyn down at every opportunity during his opening speech. It made for slow progress when the Labour leader was allowed to speak, but his case was generally well made. He wasn’t saying there were no circumstances in which the prime minister should act without a parliamentary vote, just that these weren’t them given there had been a clearly established convention since the Iraq war that parliament should be involved.On Monday Theresa May had appeared tentative, as if nervous of what sort of reaction she might get from the Commons. But now she knew she had widespread support throughout the house, she looked demob happy. The picture of someone who is having a good war. Bombing Syria has done wonders for her self-esteem. A welcome respite from dealing with the Brexit nightmare and a Home Office that was busy deporting British citizens. A woman who, for once, felt secure in herself and was determined to enjoy every moment. However brief.The prime minister began by paying lip service to the sovereignty of parliament – no one could doubt her willingness to make herself accountable after the event – but quickly went rogue. Yes, the government was aware there was a convention on consulting parliament, but personally she thought its importance was overrated.She was in charge and she could do what she liked. If she was going to have a big, big war then she might – only might – get round to getting parliamentary approval, but for the odd bombing raid she wasn’t going to go through the hassle of asking permission. The so-called convention was dead to her. And even if it wasn’t, then she had been right not to recall parliament because the whole operation had to be conducted in absolute secrecy.Several MPs intervened to point out that the US president had been busy tweeting his bombing plans well in advance of the strikes and that everyone in the country – apart from the UK parliament – appeared to be having their say on whether Britain should join in. The prime minister shrugged. What everyone was failing to understand was the classified nature of the targets. The decision to take out the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons dumps in reprisals for using chemical weapons had been a sensational double-bluff. Targets so obvious that the Syrians would never believe we would choose them. No one expects the totally expected.Job done, the prime minister tootled off to meet the South African president, leaving her backbenchers to defend her honour. They needed no second invitation. It made for a bizarre spectacle. Hardline Brexiters, who had spent the past few years arguing passionately for the sovereignty of parliament, now saying that maybe they had been a bit hasty and it was totally fine to do a little bit of ad hoc recreational bombing, just so long as you had a Conservative prime minister you could trust. Sycophantic lobby fodder admitting they were far too stupid to be allowed to make their own minds up on such serious matters.A few voices continued to make the case for the convention of parliamentary approval, but the vote was never in doubt. The Commons was happy to bow to Theresa. She had been right all along. Back in No 10, the prime minister was kicking herself. Why the hell hadn’t she bombed someone months ago?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c404e6c36f033ddb0a33f41fdbb676affb13911e/311_77_1281_769/master/1281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c3e3d3cb986a19c49f3e81fd1af32c8 1240w","title":"mps should take back control of military action jeremy corbyn","story":"Despite tabling motion, Jeremy Corbyn whips Labour MPs to vote against in protest over treatment of parliamentParliament must “take back control” of military matters by passing a law requiring the government to seek MPs’ approval before launching military action overseas, Jeremy Corbyn has argued, though Tory MPs won a symbolic vote on a Labour motion.Corbyn whipped Labour MPs to oppose the motion, suggesting parliament had been given the chance to scrutinise the UK missile strikes in response to the chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria.Introducing a second day of debates afterthe strikes, the Labour leader said Theresa May had shown flagrant disregard for the post-Iraq war convention that parliament should be consulted.May said she fully supported the principle for major action or a ground offensive, but that to debate the most recent attack in advance would have allowed Syria’s military to prepare missile defences or move the chemical weapons infrastructure targeted.The debate took place after the Speaker, John Bercow, allowed a Labour motion saying MPs had “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces overseas”. Labour whips urged the party’s MPs to vote against the motion to indicate they did not believe parliament had been able to fully consider the idea.However, Conservative MPs turned out to back the motion, and it was passed by 317 votes to 256. The parliamentary gymnastics meant Tory MPs were in the unconventional position of voting for a motion that the leader of the opposition proposed, while Corbyn opposed, but meant Labour were denied the symbolism of MPs implicitly criticising the prime minister’s approach to parliamentary approval of airstrikes. Introducing the debate, Corbyn said there had been parliamentary votes in recent years over UK involvement in military action in Libya and Syria, including in 2013 when MPs voted against it.“I’m sorry to say that the prime minister’s decision not to recall parliament, and to engage in further military action in Syria last week, showed a flagrant disregard for this convention,” he said. “It seems the convention established in 2003, and in the cabinet manual, is being tossed aside as simply being inconvenient.”It was “necessary and urgent” for parliament to discuss its rights and responsibilities, and whether there should be a law compelling ministers to seek advance approval, he said. “It’s for this house to take matters into its own hands and back our control, as some might put it.”The Chilcot inquiry into the significant intelligence and political failings before the Iraq war should be “a salutary lesson to all of us on the importance of there being total scrutiny of what goes on, and the government being required to come to the house in advance of major decisions”, Corbyn said.A new law should, as a minimum, let MPs ask ministers in advance of any action that was planned, whether it was necessary and legal, and what it would achieve, he said.“It’s difficult to argue that requiring governments to answer those questions over matters of life and death would be anything other than a positive step.”May responded by saying she too agreed MPs “should be able to debate the deployment of British military forces into combat”.But, she added, that “does not mean it is always appropriate. It therefore cannot and should be not be codified into a parliamentary right to debate every possible overseas mission in advance.“For as the exception makes clear, there are also situations where coming to parliament in advance would undermine the security of our operations or constrain the ability of our armed forces to act quickly and decisively. In these situations it is right for the prime minister to take the decision and then to be held accountable to parliament for it.”On the specifics of Saturday’s strike, Syria had “one of most sophisticated air defence systems in the world”, May said. “To counter such a system it is vital to confuse the enemy as much as possible, and to conceal the timing and targets of the planned attack.”Even to allow questions in advance would have ulged vital information, May said: “All of this would have provided invaluable information that would have put our armed forces at greater risk and greatly increased the likelihood of the regime being able to shoot down our missiles and get their chemical weapons away from our targets.”Corbyn was backed by the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said parliamentary approval should be needed in all but exceptional circumstances.However, the Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg argued that while MPs must scrutinise the decision, this could happen retrospectively. “The executive is being held to account today,” he said. “The prime minister has spent six hours yesterday in this house being held to account, and a further hour today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290ee002335d943582e276d700a55b18a62358f2/0_0_946_710/master/946.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f0a890792bf28af627ff748ac6a49d2d 1240w","title":"diamonds in sudan meteorite are remnants of lost planet","story":"Scientists say rock fragments that hit the Earth in 2008 contain evidence of a lost planet that was part of the early solar systemDiamonds found in a meteorite that exploded over the Nubian desert in Sudan a decade ago were formed deep inside a “lost planet” that once circled the sun in the early solar system, scientists say.Microscopic analyses of the meteorite’s tiny diamonds revealed they contain compounds that are produced under intense pressure, suggesting the diamonds formed far beneath the surface of a planet. In this case, the mysterious world was calculated to be somewhere between Mercury and Mars in size.Astronomers have long hypothesised that dozens of fledgling planets, ranging in size from the moon to Mars, formed in the first 10m years of the solar system and were broken apart and repackaged in violent collisions that ultimately created the terrestrial planets that orbit the sun today.If the latest findings are confirmed, the Almahata Sitta meteorite will be the only known remnants of one of these long-lost planets. The material will give scientists a unique window into the cosmic conditions that prevailed in the deep history of the solar system.“Simulations have suggested that the early solar system had tens of these embryonic planets that collided with each other to form the terrestrial planets, but having evidence of one of them? I wasn’t expecting that,” said Farhang Nabiei, who studied pieces of the meteorite at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.Philippe Gillet, a senior author on the study, said: “We are doing archaeology, looking into the past, and trying to decipher the story of the solar system.”The Almahata Sitta meteorite was the first to be tracked by telescopes as it sped towards Earth and exploded over the Nubian desert in 2008. The event prompted a recovery effort by the University of Khartoum, which gathered 480 pieces of the meteorite amounting to 4kg of battered material.Early inspections of the meteorite revealed it to be a ureilite, an unusual composition that does not match other space rocks known to have come from the moon or Mars. The finding led some scientists to speculate that it may have had a more exotic origin.That suspicion grew when researchers noticed little diamonds in the meteorite material. While other meteorites are known to contain diamond crystals, they are generally far smaller. Typical meteorite diamonds are only a few millionths of a millimetre across and are thought to form in collisions with other space rocks that send brief but intense shockwaves through the carbon-rich asteroids.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss team now describe fresh analyses that show that diamonds in the meteorite contain specks of an iron-sulphur compound that is thought only to form at pressures greater than 20 gigapascals. They conclude that the diamonds formed with the specks inside them, deep beneath the surface of an unknown world.“We are probably looking at an object that was one of the first planets to circle the sun before they collided with each other to create the actual planets we have today,” said Gillet. James Wittke, who runs the meteorite laboratory at Northern Arizona University, said the scientists’ conclusions were reasonable. “We think that there were probably many larger ‘parent’ bodies in the early solar system, which have since been destroyed, so a since-destroyed body the size of Mercury is reasonable,” he said. “One as large as Mars seems a little surprising, but this paper presents the best, and perhaps only, type of evidence for determining the sizes of these parent bodies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7248aef64f19628c301ceb3ea36cf458ca769376/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bfb1f8e6c5bfa8ce8013c2c420c23104 1240w","title":"child abuse images increasingly hidden on adult pornography sites","story":"Internet Watch Foundation says disguised pages provide secret routes to child sexual contentThere has been a sharp rise in paedophiles and organised criminals hiding child abuse images on apparently legal commercial adult pornography websites, the Internet Watch Foundation has warned.Langford said the technique of hiding illegal content, which involves using a shortened URL that directs the user through a back door to child abuse images and videos, has become increasingly popular with criminals because some international police forces and internet watchdogs still did not know how to identify such sites or take them down.“The content is remaining live for longer, which is driving their popularity,” he said.The warning comes as the charity revealed that it had removed a third more child abuse images and videos from the internet in the past year.Langford said the vast majority of disguised websites were deliberately operated by the website owner, with only a few cases of legitimate sites being hacked. He said there was a risk that people searching for adult pornography or other legal content could accidentally view child abuse images content on disguised sites. “On occasions we do see spam referrals on online forums,” said Langford. “It only takes one click for the curious and before you know it they’ve not only incriminated themselves but also viewed the illegal content.

The site will house a health club and have conference facilities. The aim is to have it built before the start of the 2019-20 rugby and football seasons.Tuesday’s vote on funding was not overwhelming – 69-41 with eight abstentions – reflecting an issue that has ided opinion in the county. Those who opposed the plan questioned not only the significant investment of public money but whether the stadium would prove a drain on resources. “I am relieved and elated,” said Paul Durkin, the chairman of Cornish Pirates. “It has been a long haul but we got our message across that this was a stadium for Cornwall, not just the partners. Councillors have voted to make life better for the next generation and give them opportunities some people have not had so far.”The council was approached at the start of the year after the partners found themselves £6m short of the money needed to finance the stadium. A local MP, Derek Thomas, is meeting government officials on Wednesday to persuade them to honour Cameron’s promise. “We met with secretaries of state and ministers after David Cameron’s commitment, but we did not have a firm proposal then,” said Thomas. “We do now and I have been doing a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between MPs and various groups in relation to this. The council’s decision makes it much easier for us to make the case for government funding to make up the shortfall.”Bristol’s plan to rebrand the club to mark their return to the Premiership, meanwhile, led to them being them mocked on social media. As part of a bid to attract a global audience the team will be known as Bristol Bears. But fans who clicked on the Bristol Bears website after hearing the news were directed to a page run by a gay club in the city, the Bristol Bear, based in Old Market.“It’s hilarious,” said one member. “I have been checking out the rugby website and I am sure the players will be welcomed in Old Market.” Bristol said they were aware of the Bristol Bear club before the rebranding and anticipated a happy co-existence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec6ad21bde100b45bf8149dafcab2ca5106432/0_164_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14be4c2a7c178b598383e900595c61fa 1240w","title":"mo farah london marathon","story":"Mo Farah believes he can compete with the very best during Sunday’s London Marathon despite failing to deliver during his first attempt at 26.2\u0026nbspmiles in 2014.The 35-year-old dramatically hit the wall in London four years ago, gritting his teeth as early as the 17-mile marker before finishing eighth in a modest 2hr 8min 21sec.This time, however, Farah intends to stay with a stellar field, even if they start at world record pace, and says he is targeting Steve Jones’s 33-year-old British record of 2:07:13, as well as Sondre Nordstad Moen’s European best of 2:05:48.“This is the biggest race,” said Farah. “And there is only one way to run it – mixing with the guys and seeing what I can do. But it’s an amazing field. It’s got Eliud Kipchoge, who has run two hours, Kenenisa Bekele, who has run 2:03 and Daniel Wanjuri, who won last year.”Farah, who has spent the past three months in Ethiopia, says he feels revitalised and relaxed under his new coach, Gary Lough, and, surprisingly, believes he has the ability to run 2:03 – not far off the world record of 2:02:57 – once he has adapted to the uniquely punishing demands of the marathon.“I think I am capable of running 2:04 or 2:03 in the right race with the right pace,” he added. “But Sunday’s race is going to be different. There are many, many guys who are there to fight, so it’s going to be a difficult race.”When asked whether he would be prepared to go at world record pace on Sunday, despite the high temperatures forecast, he nodded. “If that is what the guys are doing, why not?”Certainly Farah appeared more relaxed than last year where barely a press conference went by without him having to fend off questions about his former coach Alberto Salazar, who is still under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.Farah still faced them – insisting that he had not spoken directly to Salazar about running London or to the Nike Oregon Project coach David McHenry since last October – but no longer did he appear burdened by the association or the pressure of having to deliver gold medals over 5,000m and 10,000m.“On the track people expect you to win but now there are a lot of guys who can run a lot faster than me,” he said. “It’s a good feeling. I have found a new challenge and this is something I always wanted to do.”Farah explained that much of his confidence came from working with Lough, who had focused on his weaknesses and freshened up his training by running intervals with shorter rest periods. “There are things he has given me that I have not done before, so I am getting better at getting stronger,” said Farah. “Gary is a genius and I believe in him.”Organisers say they are monitoring the weather forecast – temperatures are projected to be 21C on Sunday – with the race director, Hugh Brasher, warning amateur runners they need to “listen to their body” and “change their plan” because of the heat.It is understood that extra water will be provided and over 1,000 medical staff will be on hand. But Farah insists he is not worried about running in the heat, despite seeing his fellow British athlete Callum Hawkins collapse during the final stages of the Commonwealth Games marathon.“I was obviously devastated seeing that,” said Farah. “Callum is a great fighter – he will go as hard as he can, and try and break the guys. But Sunday will be completely different. Hugh has told us there will be enough staff and doctors on hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be8a06f024731935ae550a4239184fc10a9ab29c/91_0_2684_1611/master/2684.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bf4935b22e2060efce3e3af79b9feb25 1240w","title":"runaway 32 year old princess brought back to dubai","story":"Sheikha Latifa, daughter of ruler Sheikh Mohammed, had used YouTube to tell of plan to fleeA Dubai princess who announced in a video that she was fleeing the emirate has been “brought back”, a source close to the Dubai government has said.“What I can confirm is they took her and she was brought back,” the source said on condition of anonymity.The source said he did not know where the royal, 32-year-old Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum – was tracked down or by whom, only that she was now “with her family” and “doing excellent”.Sheikha Latifa, a daughter of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, appeared in a YouTube video in March announcing she was about to flee.“I’m making this video because it could be the last video I make,” she began.Dressed simply in a T-shirt with her hair pulled back and sitting by a curtained window, the young woman appeared to be filming the video herself.She said she was the daughter of the Dubai ruler and an Algerian mother, Horriya Ahmed, and that she had tried to escape in years past, before she had access to the internet.She said her leaving was “the start of me claiming my life, my freedom”.Over the past month Latifa’s cause has been taken up by a UK-based group called Detained in Dubai, which claims to assist victims of injustice across the United Arab Emirates.The group said the young woman attempted to flee Dubai by ship, but the vessel was intercepted on 4 March, less than 50 miles (80km) off the coast of India.Detained in Dubai has since launched a campaign on her behalf.The source said it was a “private matter” that had been “exploited”, accusing rival Qatar of fuelling the campaign.“It is a domestic issue that transformed into a soap opera that transformed into a rampaging scheme to tarnish the reputation of Dubai and Sheikh Mohammed,” the source said.He said Latifa’s three main companions who participated in the escape attempt – a Finnish woman and two French men, one with dual US citizenship – were wanted in Dubai on previous charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eeed8de0a3d14961b2f9d518d689ffaa5597751/191_442_5730_3438/master/5730.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0736aa3826ab1f52e52f36b2c4403e99 2600w","title":"tina review turner musical aldwych theatre london","story":"Aldwych theatre, LondonPhyllida Lloyd’s musical is a heady celebration of triumph over adversity, with an astonishing turn by Adrienne WarrenThis terrific show is billed as the “untold” story of Tina Turner. Given that there has already been a bestselling memoir called I, Tina, a popular biopic starring Angela Bassett and even a jukebox musical, Soul Sister, the claim looks a little exaggerated. But this version, which comes with its subject’s blessing, offers a heady celebration of triumph over adversity and boasts a whirlwind performance by Adrienne Warren that left the audience, though not the star herself, breathless. The book by Katori Hall, assisted by Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins, dwells on Tina Turner’s extraordinary tenacity and ability to overcome life’s obstacles. Born Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tennessee, and loving singing in Baptist choirs, she learns to cope with her parents’ separation. Teamed professionally with Ike Turner, whom she eventually marries, she has to endure the horrors of serial abuse. Divorced and striking out on her own, she initially pays a heavy financial price and, as a 40-year-old woman of colour, suffers rejection by a record industry dominated by white men. As the world knows, however, she went on to achieve solo stardom.While recording Tina’s troubles, the show is anything but a sob story since it is a tribute to her gutsiness and drive. I’d have liked to have heard more about how her Baptist upbringing and Buddhist conversion sustained her during the dark times, but Tina’s travails are always offset by the glories of the music. What is striking is the way the songs – and there are 23 of them – are used in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are there to advance the narrative, as when Tina steps into the breach in the recording studio and rescues a session by singing A Fool in Love. At other times, they demonstrate her capacity for reinvention: in River Deep, Mountain High she follows Phil Spector’s injunction to stick to the melody rather than relying on the kind of aggressive fervour encouraged by Ike. Only once did I sense a clunking cue for a song when Tina, talking to a sympathetic marketing man, superfluously enquires “what’s love got to do with it?” But the show rests on the shoulders of Warren, who is rarely off stage and who is simply astonishing. Above all, she captures the fact there is not one Tina Turner but several. Warren shows how Tina develops and changes as a singer and how, in moving to rock stardom, she retains her ferocious energy while introducing occasional notes of plangent melancholy. Warren also conveys Tina’s growth from stoical victim of Ike’s cruelty into a woman of defiant confidence. On top all that, she dances up a storm in a way that had the audience on its feet even before the curtain call. The tricky role is that of Ike, and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith skilfully counters his monstrosity by suggesting that he never got his due as a pre-Elvis rock’n’roll pioneer and that he was a product of a culture that encouraged male swagger: you don’t like Ike but you begin to understand him. That, however, is the mark of a production by Phyllida Lloyd that is both intelligent and consistently good to look at. Mark Thompson’s design uses projections to create a whirling panorama of America, Bruno Poet’s lighting evokes the empurpled skies of Tennessee and the softer registers of a Monet-like Thames and, not least, there is the choreography of Anthony van Laast, which ensures the show is in perpetual motion. As bio-musicals go, this is as good as it gets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a44832c9bb02966cede6fe65b4ec1e0db8271ded/0_811_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=32606c086fcf03f1db5962db4c6ccee1 1240w","title":"selling twitter handles big business identity","story":"The perfect @ identity is a must-have accessory for big companies and brand-conscious celebrities – at any costEverything has a price, even the top Twitter handles, and if somebody does not want to sell then they may be forced to relinquish their account.“We have a marketplace which allows the sale of Twitter handles,” says Philly, a subversive marketer who founded ForumKorner, an online gaming forum. “Unlike some websites, however, we do not allow the sales of stolen accounts that some people phish, or hack, to obtain before reselling them.”It’s the same across the whole of social media. Last month a teenage boy was given a £5,000 cruise in exchange for his Snapchat username while accounts on Instagram are sold openly on online marketplaces. Shady brokers stalk the web searching for the most potentially lucrative handles, convincing their owners to part with them before reselling at a significantly higher price.“It’s funny some people don’t know the true value of a handle,” says another trader on condition of anonymity. “For example, I used to look for three-letter acronyms. The handle would generally go for around $30 but little do they know people look for specific @’s correlating with their business. I’ve flipped $20-$40 to $700 on multiple occasions.”Elsewhere, people allege their accounts have been phished, and their handles stolen and sold, yet Twitter has apparently not implemented robust systems to prevent the practice.“Twitter has yet to go after the hackers or phishers, let alone the legitimate account sellers, like myself,” says Philly. “Phishing an account is as easy as downloading an infected program, ticking a couple options and hitting run.”“They used social engineering strategies with multiple other services and sites (like Amazon),” says Josh Bryant, a designer at a digital product firm, who documented how he almost lost his handle in a blog post.“The why is just money. I own both @jb on Twitter and Instagram and there’s a huge economy for desirable usernames right now. If a hacker can get them, list and sell them before the site responds they stand to make a pretty healthy profit.”Another user claims their username was taken by Twitter itself. “A broker kept approaching me, and when I declined his final offer, a formal complaint was made to Twitter, by whom I don’t know, and the handle was handed over to JPMorgan,” says Chase Giunta, a software developer who previously owned the handle @Chase.“I always assumed JP Morgan would want it since they’re the largest bank in the US, but I also assumed they, or maybe even Twitter, would contact me directly to set up some kind of exchange – not some shady broker.”Twitter, however, does not permit the trading of usernames. It explicitly states: “Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.” This does not seem to have stopped them changing hands, though.“After his last offer, I received action from Twitter,” says Giunta. “The steps they took to take my account down were incredibly unsettling. They sent me automated emails claiming I was impersonating Chase Bank, which I wasn’t, before they took the username from me.”“Of course, in hindsight, I would’ve accepted his last $20,000 offer. But I thought I was doing the ‘right thing’ by turning it down at that time.”This sentiment was echoed by Patrick de Laive, the founder of The Next Web, who was offered $20,000 for @patrick by an athlete.Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity to prevent handle squatting. In the early days of the social media giant, this meant people could contact the administrator and request inactive handles.A former Twitter employee told the Guardian how they could request unused usernames for themselves and family. Others have since demonstrated the relative ease in which enterprising people can secure their desired handle.“I got my first name as my Twitter handle after a six-month campaign that included some light Internet stalking, badgering staff at Twitter, $250 and a visit to the patent office,” says Haje Jan, a director at Bold, a venture capitalist company, whose first name was taken by an inactive user.“I registered a web domain for my first name to strengthen my case (in case the trademark people decided to look any deeper), then forked over my £170 to the Intellectual Property Office, registering Haje™ as a trademark.”“Armed with the trademark I contacted Twitter’s support team and about a week later, I received an email saying that I could either create a new account or move the username to an existing account. Mission accomplished – and it turned out to be easier than I anticipated.”It’s not just iniduals who have bought up desirable usernames. The state of Israel bought the @israel handle for reported six-figure sum in 2010, while CNN employed the owner of @cnnbrk as a consultant in exchange for transferring them the account.“Twitter has always been very clear that it’s against their terms and conditions to sell usernames but that hasn’t stopped people trying,” says Sue Llewellyn, who trains journalists to use social media. “They also frown upon people squatting on usernames – ie creating an account and not using it.”“Frankly I think if a big name celebrity wanted a specific name that wasn’t being used then they could probably get it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

So, take a seat in the mighty arena alongside 12,000 spectators (togas optional)The first gladiator is down, flailing his gladius towards the emperor before being pummelled by a giant hammer (thankfully, into a furrow of sand left by one of the racing chariots). Two “slaves” rush on and drag his body off towards the spoliarium. Suddenly, everyone is up out of their seats: the retiarius (net man) has dropped his trident and the mirmillones (fish men) are closing in.Nîmes’ Les Grands Jeux Romains (Great Roman Games) is one of the biggest re-enactment spectaculars in Europe. Sitting among 12,000 handkerchief-waving spectators in the city’s first-century Roman amphitheatre last year, I realised it makes for a mesmerising and charmingly-brutal event. Having already featured Hannibal (2015), Cleopatra (2016) and, last year, Boudicca, this year’s games, which take place from 28-30 April, is devoted to Spartacus.“The first Great Roman Games was held in Nîmes in 2010 with little publicity,” says Valérie Espin, in charge of the games’ organisation company, Culturespaces. “The idea was just to have some chariots parading around the arena and people dressed up as Romans. But it has captured the public’s imagination and now there is a cast of 500 performing in front of 32,000 spectators over three days.”In the corner of Espin’s office is a giant scutum (curved Roman shield) and on top of her filing cabinet, a pair of gladiator helmets. “Participants take it very seriously,” she says. “Most of the re-enactors meet weekly, dress up as Romans and spend the weekend on camps, training for battles, preparing Roman food, testing equipment and living as Romans.”This year there are 28 different Roman associations taking part: 11 from France, 16 from Italy, one from Croatia and, for the first time, a group from Britain, Legio Secunda Augusta.“Seven of us are going to Nîmes from our gladiator group based in Portsmouth,” says dental nurse and weekend gladiatrix, Alisa Vanlint. “All the names we use are authentic the Second Augustus Legion was based in Britain for a while.”It’s also the first time female gladiators will fight at the games. “I am Achillia and will be fighting Amazonia – the names come from a marble relief in the British Museum.”Vanlint teaches stage combat and also re-enacts medieval and “1805” battles but her favourite is Roman. “I love sharing an amazing piece of history.” She will appear in the oval arena straight after the horse chases and then as a slave in Spartacus’s army in the second part of the show. Other members of Legio Secunda Augusta are soldiers and civilians.“The helmets are heavy but once you’re fighting, the adrenalin kicks in and the longer you wear it the easier it becomes. I don’t notice it after a while, it’s the same with cuts and bruises,” says Vanlint.Outside the arena, the city’s street’s will also be hectic with Roman revelry. There’s a Roman market selling asses’ milk cosmetics, oil, grapejuice and honey followed by a night-time parade with flaming torches. A Roman galley is on the esplanade and local restaurants will serve Roman-style food, while children solve clues in a treasure-hunt-enigma game.Restoration of the arena will continue for another 12 years. “Repairs of the terraces have given us another 130 seats this year,” says Espin. “Many of the local buildings contain stones looted from the amphitheatre and replacements come from the same Nîmes quarries as they did in Roman times.Besides the arcaded amphitheatre, Nîmes also has the Maison Carrée temple and the Tour Magne. All three can be visited on a combined ticket (€13 adult, €11 child, family ticket €40). Nîmes’ will also see its spectacular new Musée de la Romanité open on 2 June, with 3,500 square metres of multimedia exhibition space dedicated to Roman mosaics, sculptures and everyday objects. Its first exhibition, Gladiators: Heroes of the Colosseum, runs until 24 September 2018.There are also the ruins of the Temple of Diana, as well as two Roman city gates and the Castellum that collected water carried in from Uzès across the Pont du Gard viaduct.• Adult from €15, child from €5, Les Grands Jeux Romains, 28-30 April, arenes-nimes.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59221629a955ac31157ebfca07459a99a98b0dc/0_125_1532_1260/master/1532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=414e0a55a9d5b21139f2360261fedcf9 1240w","title":"aubrey plaza legion interview weird exhausting not being human","story":"How do you play a gender-fluid psychotic figment of a mutant’s imagination? The star of the superhero psychodrama reveals all – and explains why her friends can’t watch itAubrey Plaza finds it hard to describe her character in the TV superhero drama Legion. Is she alive or dead? Good or evil? Human or mutant? Real or a figment of the lead character, mutant David Haller’s imagination? “That’s a really, really good question,” says Plaza, before saying that Lenny Busker began as a human woman, then became trapped in a dimension of Haller’s mind, and has now been stranded by the evil Shadow King on the “astral plane”. It’s “a total mindfuck”, says Plaza. “It’s mentally and physically exhausting to not exist as a human. At the end of the day I would just feel like nothing, just this rag doll that’s been thrown around.”Legion’s strangeness might be stifling, but the 33-year-old has long specialised in disconcerting kooks. She is best known for playing April Ludgate in Parks and Recreation, a sardonic and contrarian member of the low-level local government department who spends her days spouting morbid soundbites and making people feel uncomfortable. It was a part written especially for her after a casting director told the show’s co-creator Michael Schur that she had met “the weirdest girl” and he should work her into the sitcom.Soon, it would become obvious to everyone that Plaza’s strangeness wasn’t confined to the screen. In 2013, for reasons she would later refuse to explain, she stormed the stage at the MTV Movie awards and attempted to wrestle Will Ferrell’s award from his hands. On YouTube, people began making compilations of her eye-wateringly awkward chatshow appearances, characterised by eerily deadpan jokes and a thousand-yard stare. Plaza’s oddball shtick has been convincing enough to earn her some high-profile gigs: over the past decade she’s brought her singular sensibility to a swath of comedies, from Judd Apatow’s Funny People to the frankly alarming Robert De Niro vehicle Dirty Grandpa. Last year, however, Plaza took her eccentric persona to new dramatic heights in the comedy-drama Ingrid Goes West, which she also produced. As Ingrid, a lost and lonely young woman who obsesses over and eventually infiltrates the life of an Instagram influencer, Plaza was both peculiarly amusing and hauntingly sad.Ingrid Goes West is a brilliant distillation of the compulsion and deceit hardwired into platforms like Instagram for Plaza, it was a message that really hit home. “In Ingrid, you have someone who already has enough trouble having normal healthy relationships, then you give them a device that lets them play out their most toxic impulses,” she says over the phone from her home in Los Angeles. “And I think on a smaller scale that’s what’s happening with everyone on social media.”Plaza briefly deleted her Twitter account in 2016, signing off with the message: “Dear Twitter it’s been fun but I’ve realized you are wrong for me and maybe the world.” She explains that she has “such a hard time” with social media. “Most of the time it just makes me feel bad. I know the feeling of being scared not to engage with social media because you feel like ‘I’m going to lose these connections and lose this awareness of myself’, but it’s all bullshit. I haven’t been on Facebook in over 10 years. It’s changed nothing in my life, I don’t think about it at all.”Though it’s adapted from a Marvel comic, Legion, which returns for its second series this week, certainly isn’t your average superhero fare. With Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley at the helm, it’s set in a retro-futurist 1960s universe, and spends less time on deafening fight scenes and more on goofy dance routines. Another thing that differentiates Legion from the rest of the Marvel universe is its depiction of mental illness. Haller, played by Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens, and Plaza’s character Busker originally meet in Clockworks psychiatric hospital, where the former has received a schizophrenia diagnosis as a result of the “voices” he is able to hear. Once Haller is rescued, however, he is told that those voices are not symptoms but telepathic powers. In a world where television shows from Mr Robot to Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are tackling mental health with increasing sensitivity, Legion’s equation of mental illness and superheroism has ided critics, with some praising Legion’s detailed depiction of the condition, and others criticising the show for using schizophrenia as a flimsy way to court thrills. Busker begins (and, in some senses, ends) her life in a psychiatric ward, so I’m interested to hear Plaza’s take on the issue. Yet while she acknowledges her character had “addiction problems”, Plaza sounds unclear about Lenny’s precise ailment, claiming “it wasn’t something that was ever labelled”. For that reason, she says, she didn’t do much research into the subject of mental illness in preparation for the role. Instead, she stresses the way the show mines horror from the disorientating nature of mental distress. “What is real, what is not real – it’s the overall question,” says Plaza. “Going mad is one of the scariest ideas for me. To not trust your own mind is a really frightening idea.”Legion is indeed frightening. A sense of nameless horror pervades every scene, as the grotesque monsters that plague Haller’s memories shift in and out of focus (“I have some friends who can’t watch it because they’re so disturbed by it,” says Plaza). Lenny was initially written to be played by a middle-aged man, with Plaza insisting all the original dialogue remained intact, meaning Lenny ends up both crass and subtly androgynous.It’s something that becomes especially apparent when Lenny is viewed in the context of the show’s other major female character Syd, a wide-eyed, girlish mutant who begins a romantic relationship with Haller. I ask Plaza how it feels to play a character whose gender seems so ambiguous. “I love it,” she says. “There’s a fluidity to Lenny and I just think it’s more interesting playing a character that’s not so identifiable. It’s really fun to decide how someone like that moves and looks - it’s allowed me to do whatever I want.” Sporting a curly bob and a selection of suits and dungarees, Plaza spends most of Legion physically unrecognisable - swaggering and manspreading, as well as cajoling and threatening Haller with a blokey air. But as time goes on and the Shadow King becomes more desperate, Lenny uses intimidation tactics that feel sexually loaded and sinister. “I think it’s really interesting when you have a character like that pitted against someone like David Haller,” says Plaza. “That dynamic was always really interesting to me because I feel like Lenny has a sexual energy to her, but it’s not always a feminine energy, it’s more kind of masculine.”Despite being possessed by the embodiment of evil, throughout all of this Lenny also remains Haller’s close pal from the psychiatric hospital, and Plaza interprets the original characters’ relationship as sexual too. “At times it feels like they’re just friends and at times it feels like there’s some kind of attraction there,” she says. Plaza’s next project is unsettling in a different sense. She stars in An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn, a film by Jim Hosking, whose gross-out debut The Greasy Strangler proved to be one of the more curious films of 2016. Plaza describes it as a “quadrangle love story between four freaks”, and the film, which also features her Legion co-star Jemaine Clement, has already disturbed critics on the festival circuit (the Hollywood Reporter called it “strenuously weird”). It’s another eccentric addition to her CV, but Plaza still feels as if she doesn’t get enough odd scripts. “I like them strange,” she says. “I want more of them. I’ve always been drawn to weird movies, I loved John Waters and Christopher Guest growing up, and I’m always looking for stories you just can’t believe someone would think up.” Considering a dimension-hopping, mutant-baiting creature wasn’t enough to sate Plaza’s appetite for strange stories, you suspect that where weirdness is concerned, the astral plane’s not quite the limit.

So people can see he had a life, not just in death, but before.”Asif Kapadia and James Gay-Rees’s new three-part documentary (BBC One) begins with Doreen. She is getting ready for her interview and taking a sip from a cup of tea while sitting in front of a dark-grey backdrop. The look of the film is immediately arresting. The interviews are all filmed with the same backdrop, which is a little less dark where it has been lit around the subject. Then the subjects are filmed close up, sometime very close, so that only part of the face is visible.It gives a uniformity to it – and a seriousness. More like testimony than interview. Everyone is treated the same: Doreen and Neville Lawrence family friends and relations various (invariably) former police officers. Duwayne Brooks, who was attacked with his best friend but then treated more like a suspect than a victim, features heavily, as does the Lawrence’s lawyer, Imran Khan. Paul Dacre is here, because he is the editor of the Daily Mail, as well as once having employed Neville as a plasterer. Theresa May features in Thursday’s final part. Alexandra Marie, who was a 19-year-old au pair in south London in April 1993 and who witnessed the attack, is also present, as is Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who\u0026nbspplayed Doreen in Paul Greengrass’s drama The Murder of Stephen Lawrence, clips of which are used here between\u0026nbspthe testimony, like classy reconstructions.Yes, there have been many other films about Stephen’s murder, but none so exhaustive and meticulous. It puts it into the context of early 90s Britain: happy and Soul II Soul inclusive on the surface, but with pockets of hatred, no-go areas for people of colour, more racially motivated attacks and murders, a BNP on the rise, and institutional racism coursing through the veins of the police.This first episode, called The Loss of Joy – a double meaning, because Joy was Doreen’s pet name in Jamaica – puts it into an even wider context. It\u0026nbspcovers Doreen coming to Britain in 1963, where she met and married Neville and had Stephen. She found joy for 30 years, until 22 April 1993, when it was torn away. Doreen was away that morning, on a course. “Dad, are\u0026nbspyou OK?” the 18-year-old asked Neville, who was staring out of the window. Those were the last words Neville heard from his son. Later that day, Stephen and Duwayne were at a bus stop, waiting, for too long – you know how it goes. The passing of 25 years doesn’t make it any less hard to hear Duwayne describe what happened.Then came a family’s grief, no arrests, a breakdown in\u0026nbspcommunication and of trust. It took a visit from the most famous man in the world, Nelson Mandela, for anything to happen.One of the most chilling moments in the first episode is audio of police interviews with the suspects. The repeated, cocky “No comment” and “No reply” from Jamie Acourt, Neil\u0026nbspAcourt and David Norris, as you would expect. But what DS John Davidson says to Gary Dobson is just as shocking. “Personally, I don’t think it was a racist attack,” Davidson says to the suspect. “I think it’s incidental.”Two black youths are attacked, unprovoked, by a bunch of white strangers shouting the N-word. Yeah, nothing obviously racist about that, more like incidental. Even if it was the\u0026nbsplast incident in Stephen’s life, while some of his killers remain free.A quarter of a century doesn’t make it any less pertinent or relevant, either. The anniversary is the reason for the timing of the film. But its broadcast coincides with the National Crime Agency considering a new inquiry that could see four former detectives face criminal charges. The investigation continues. Add to that the rise of hate crimes that Brexit and economic uncertainty have triggered and a resurgence of the far right. Meanwhile, people who came to this country at the same time as Doreen and Neville are being\u0026nbspthreatened with deportation.Stephen’s murder asked searching questions and had\u0026nbspa profound effect on Britain. The conversation isn’t over, though. It is, as his mother says, important to continue to\u0026nbsptalk about him and about his death. Because\u0026nbspit continues to be important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84391e1c73c5356e0e40087655e6e1e6789016c2/0_239_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a401222f36ec7da6287aadf2897636ad 1240w","title":"iraq us military citizen held transfer","story":"ACLU to challenge ‘forcible rendering’ of unnamed US citizen, held by US military in Iraq for seven months after capture by Syrian rebelsAn American citizen who has been held without charge in Iraq since last September by the US military now faces being moved to an unidentified foreign country under government plans that his lawyers are scrambling to challenge.A heavily redacted court document, released on Tuesday at the orders of a federal judge in Washington, reveals the intention of the defense secretary, Gen James Mattis, to move the detainee to a third country, having kept him captive for the past seven months in Iraq.The name of the receiving country is being kept secret, though reports have suggested it is Saudi Arabia.The American Civil Liberties Union plans to challenge the transfer, which it argues is unlawful. The detainee – whose identity is also being kept secret and who is referred to in legal papers only as John Doe – was held for the first four months with no access to any lawyer until the ACLU waged a fierce court battle and won the right to represent him.The judge in the case, Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia, called the government’s resistance to grant the man his basic right of a lawyer “both remarkable and troubling”. She has also forbidden the US military from moving the detainee without giving lawyers 72 hours to challenge the decision.The civil liberties group is calling the transfer plan a case of “forcible rendering”. As such it has echoes of the black-site renditions program that was run by the US government in the wake of 911.“The Trump administration has been detaining this American citizen unlawfully for more than seven months, and forcibly rendering him to another country would be an unconscionable violation of his constitutional rights. The government has no legal authority to detain this US citizen in the first place, and it clearly lacks any legal authority to transfer him to the custody of another government,” said the ACLU’s attorney in the case, Jonathan Hafetz.John Doe was captured by Syrian rebels as a suspected member of Isis. When his US citizenship was discovered, he was handed over to the US military on 14 September. Previous court documents have indicated that the man was born in the US but also has a passport from Saudi Arabia, where he was brought up.The government has alleged that the inidual signed up with Isis in July 2014. According to the Washington Post, he allegedly agreed to join as a “fighter” but not a “suicide bomber”.In their nine-page filing, government lawyers argue that “extensive diplomatic discussions” have taken place with the unidentified third country, and that it is now “imperative that the transfer occur quickly and smoothly”. They claim that any delay would “undermine the United States’ credibility with an important foreign partner that has agreed to this request”.A hearing over the government’s transfer plans will be held before Chutkan on Thursday."},{"url":null,"title":"james comey book former fbi agents reaction","story":"Former senior officials warn ex-director is putting Russia investigation in jeopardy with book and ‘tasteless’ commentsFormer senior FBI agents have accused James Comey of damaging the agency’s reputation and “playing a dangerous game” with the Russia investigations by going on the offensive with an explosive book and media interviews.Those speaking out also say they have been contacted by multiple agents currently working for the FBI who are displeased and uncomfortable with Comey, their ex-director, getting into a fierce war of words with the president, who fired him last year.Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth Lies, and Leadership, is being published on Tuesday and has been previewed in the Guardian and some other outlets. And in a lengthy interview with ABC on Sunday night, the former director of the FBI said Donald Trump was morally unfit to be president. But his high-profile commentary has upset former colleagues who had held him in high regard both personally and professionally.“It’s tasteless at best. There is a total lack of dignity. He, and a number of other FBI employees who worked directly for him, have damaged the agency,” Nancy Savage, executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, said of Comey’s book and interview.Savage, who was an agent for 30 years and was president of the FBI special agents association while serving, before she retired in 2011, told the Guardian it was highly inappropriate for Comey to talk about matters relating to the president that are currently under investigation.In his interview with ABC on Sunday, Comey discussed topics such as whether Trump may have obstructed justice by pressing him, while he was still FBI director, to drop his inquiry into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s links to Russia. Comey repeated his assertion that Trump asked him for his loyalty, and he aired unconfirmed allegations that Russia has compromising personal material on the president.These issues are among those under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller and two Senate committees.She also criticized some Comey colleagues such as Andrew McCabe, who was fired  last month over accusations of leaking to the press.Serving agents generally shy away from speaking publicly about FBI matters or politics but there has been plenty of talk behind the scenes. Savage and other former agents said they had heard from FBI staff in the hours since Comey’s interview on ABC aired, and they were not happy.Former senior agent Bobby Chacon said: “The majority of people I have spoken to since Sunday night think it’s unfortunate timing. They are rolling their eyes it’s not good.”Chacon retired in 2014 as head of the FBI underwater forensic e team based in Los Angeles, after being an agent for 27 years. He said there were “still plenty of people” in the agency who supported Comey but many were upset at him “standing on a soapbox”.Chacon is also concerned that Comey, by talking about issues involving Russia and the Trump administration and election campaign, is opening himself up to a tough cross examination if he appears as a witness in any criminal proceedings arising from the investigations.“Comey knows these things, so he may have made the judgment that he’s being careful, but he is playing a dangerous game,” said Chacon, adding: “I worked for him. He did a lot of good things at the FBI. He was popular and I didn’t like the way the White House sacked him ... but he made mistakes and now has been overtaken by his emotions. I’m surprised he has been dragged down into street-fighting with Trump.”Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI’s criminal ision, said he thought Comey had been out of the FBI for long enough that his public comments were less likely to compromise the work of Mueller or Congress. But he said that he believed, and had heard from serving agents, that Comey’s speaking out was only fuel to Trump’s criticism of the agency.“I’m very confident that Robert Mueller knows how to conduct his investigation. But by talking like this Comey is not helping the FBI’s ability to fight back against the attacks on its reputation that have been coming from Trump,” he said. He said it would exacerbate the rift between Trump and the FBI.“I expect these wounds to remain open for a very long time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija. Alfred Degiorgio’s personal phone and the device said to be his burner phone appear to remain there all night and most of the following day.16 October:1.41am - Trigger sim is switched on. It signals from Bidnija, where Caruana Galizia’s car is parked outside her home.8am - The Maya is filmed on CCTV leaving Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Phone data suggests only George Degiorgio was on board.8.30am – The Vodafone mast in Bidnija goes off grid and is closed for maintenance until 6pm.2.55pm - CCTV shows the Maya stopping in sheltered water beneath the Siege Bell war memorial.2.58pm –  Text message is allegedly sent from the boat to the circuit board sim, detonating a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of Caruana Galizia’s car.3.20pm – Phone data shows the Maya heading back towards the harbour.3.30pm - George Degiorgio sends a message from his personal phone to his partner: “Buy me wine, my love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e165bb56752515e2215e75874275dd15145b1f78/408_650_3092_1856/master/3092.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c004d9489113efb171913ca69b2e621f 1240w","title":"daphne caruana galizia malta has made me a scapegoat","story":"Journalist details decades of harassment in recording made days before her murderLess than a week before her murder, Daphne Caruana Galizia talked about her life and what it had become. In a remarkable and previously unheard recording, the journalist described arson attacks on her home, attempts to cut off her income, the freezing of her bank accounts, dozens of libel suits brought by ministers and business people, and attacks online and in the street by critics who branded her a “witch”.By turns fearful, defiant and darkly amused, the journalist set out in her own words the danger she was in. Six days later she died in a car bomb.The interview in October 2017 was for a study by a human rights group, the Council of Europe, in which she was asked to detail decades of threats and harassment.“They have made me into what in effect is a national scapegoat. And this has gone on for 30 years now, almost,” she said.“I am in a situation where people who can’t even read English, and therefore have never read anything I’ve written, at the same time are aware of who I am, know that they are meant to hate me … and react to me on that basis. Totally irrespective of what I write, but as the person, as the figure, that they are told to hate.”A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the Guardian, Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Shared by her family as part of the Daphne Project, the recording paints a haunting picture of how the world had closed in on Caruana Galizia during the last four years of her life.Well-known in Malta since her mid-20s, when she became a columnist, Caruana Galizia had helped launch an English language newspaper, the Malta Independent, published her own lifestyle magazine, and then the blog Running Commentary. A mixture of news, scoops, and coruscating opinion pieces, it earned her many enemies. In true gonzo journalism style, Caruana Galizia never hesitated to place herself at the centre of the story.Her involvement in the 2016 Panama Papers investigation brought her blog to international attention – and led to even more intrusive scrutiny of her in Malta.She described how members of the public were encouraged to film and photograph her, and post the results to social media. Many of the pictures appeared on a blog run by Glenn Bedingfield, a communications adviser in the office of the prime minister, who published hundreds of pieces on the journalist.“In one year, in one year, there were 380 posts about me. More than one a day … I’d be in my local coffee shop having a cup of coffee and they’d encourage people to take photos of me and send them in. I mean, there’s no news value in that, you know. It was just harassment.”Caruana Galizia said she had not been to the beach for four years, after an incident in which a group had followed her, uploading photos in real time to Facebook.She compared her life to Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible, about the persecution of women as witches in the 17th century. “You watch it and you think: ‘Madonna, this is like Malta but with different clothes.’”Clearly aligned with Malta’s right of centre Nationalist party, Caruana Galizia’s criticism of the opposition Labour party and its supporters could also be merciless. Asked by the Guardian to respond to the criticisms Caruana Galizia made of him and his party, Bedingfield said she would often use her blog to encourage readers to post photos of Labour politicians in private moments with their families. “She was more of a political commentator than a journalist, with her own agenda,” said Bedingfield, now a Labour MP. “She used her blog on the net to target and hound iniduals. There was a feeling among Labour supporters that only a taste of her own medicine would deter her.”The MP said he had never advocated violence against Caruana Galizia, or any other Maltese citizen. He said Malta had a “very lively media”, which was often critical of government.Caruana Galizia married young and had three children by her mid-20s when she was hired as a columnist by the Sunday Times of Malta. Until then, she recalled, comment pieces had been written anonymously.“Malta got its first named newspaper columnist and it was a 25-year-old woman. And this thing was a double shock. And I used to have people actually telling me: ‘But does your husband write them for you? Does your father? Does your brother?’”Becoming well known at a young age prepared her for what was to come, she said. “I literally know no other way of life. I got used to it, like, you know, like a scar forms around a wound.”The attempts to silence her began early on, according to a list of attacks compiled by the family. In 1995, after reporting on the activity of a drug trafficker, their dog’s throat was slit and its body left at the door of their home.In 2006, truck tyres were piled up and set on fire against their back door in the middle of the night. During the 2008 general election, Caruana Galizia and her youngest son, Paul, then a 19-year-old student, attended a political debate at the University of Malta. Throughout the event they were filmed and photographed at close range, before Labour-supporting media broadcast the footage on television and online. By then, Caruana Galizia’s support for the Nationalist party had made her a target in Malta’s tribal, two-party system. The Labour campaign plastered her face on billboards, depicting her as a member of the ruling elite.In 2013, the mayor of a Maltese town led a mob that followed Caruana Galizia through the streets, insulting her and chanting slogans, until she sought refuge in a convent. The nuns bolted the door and called the police.When Labour won power five years ago, the harassment intensified. It now appeared to be, in effect, government-sanctioned harassment. Caruana Galizia feared for her family. Her husband, Peter, saw government contracts withdrawn from his law firm. Last year her son Andrew, a diplomat, was recalled from India with two weeks’ notice. He has since quit his job. Responding to questions about Andrew’s departure, the prime minister said in an email from his spokesman that he did not involve himself in inidual staffing matters, and that he had been assured “nothing irregular occurred and that all proper and correct procedures were followed”. Caruana Galizia’s biggest fear was that her example might discourage other journalists, women in particular, from speaking out. She described a “climate of fear”, saying “all journalists in Malta know that they are operating under the goodwill of those they write about”.Before Caruana Galizia was killed, there were 47 libel suits outstanding against her, but she remained defiant. Towards the end of their interview, she told the researcher: “There isn’t one politician in parliament now, on either side of the house, who was there when I started working. I’ve seen them all off, you know, and I am still here, being targeted by the same machine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcee9834254e928805c39c8ae51665966a55bec0/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9a1abb1b37b2bf010fefdeb4625823fd 1240w","title":"face transplants jerome hamon first french man two","story":"A French man is recovering in a Paris hospital after becoming the first person in the world to undergo two face transplants. Jérôme Hamon, who suffers from a condition which causes disfiguring tumours, underwent his first transplant in 2010, but his body eventually rejected his new face which had to be removed.He is now in a Paris hospital, three months after undergoing an unprecedented second transplant carried out by Laurent Lantieri, the same professor of plastic surgery who carried out the first procedure.Hamon’s new face remains smooth and motionless, with his skull, skin and features yet to be fully aligned – a gradual process reliant on immunosuppressant drugs which, it is hoped, will prevent his body from rejecting the transplanted material. “I feel very well in myself,” Hamon, 43, told reporters. “I can’t wait to get rid of all this,” he said.Hamon suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic mutation which causes severe disfiguration and related complications. His first face transplant in 2010 was a success. But that same year – in order to treat a common cold – he was given an antibiotic incompatible with his immunosuppressive treatment. In 2016 he began to display signs of transplant rejection, and his new face began to die, leading Lantieri to remove it. That left Hamon without a face, a condition that Lantieri described as “the walking dead”. Hamon had no eyelids, no ears, no skin and could not speak or eat. He had limited hearing and could express himself only by turning his head slightly, in addition to writing a little. “If you have no skin, you have infections,” Lantieri told the Associated Press on Tuesday. “We were very concerned about the possibility of a new rejection.”Hamon remained in hospital without a face for two months, while a compatible donor was sought. Eventually, a second face donor became available, and Lantieri and his team performed a second transplant in January. Before undergoing the second transplant, doctors had to replace all of the blood in his body in a month-long procedure, to eliminate some potentially problematic antibodies from previous treatments.“For a man who went through all this, which is like going through a nuclear war, he’s doing fine,” Lantieri said. He added that Hamon is now being monitored like any other face transplant patient.Hamon’s first face was donated by a 60-year-old. With his second transplanted face, Hamon said he managed to drop a few decades.“I’m 43. The donor was 22. So I’ve become 20 years younger,” Hamon joked on French television on Tuesday.Despite all the anxiety and suffering, Hamon said he was a happy man again. “The first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought ‘this is my new face’ and this time it’s the same,” he told AFP. “If I hadn’t accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It’s a question of identity … But here we are, it’s good, it’s me.” There have now been about 40 face transplants throughout the world since the first partial transplant was performed on Isabelle Dinoire in 2005. Her nose, lips, chin and parts of her cheeks had been removed after she was bitten by her dog.This article includes material from AP and AFP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce336712643553b02b346f4b06255c0040075960/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e528a9f9964e906a14d9e802bc6db6ee 10500w","title":"destruction in douma latest photographs from the conflict in syria","story":"Images from eastern Ghouta taken after Syrian forces reportedly defeated opposition fighters in the area "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3464554.1523984300!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"council takes legal action against dublin pub over refurbishment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOpium closed for a number of months last year for a large refurbishment. Photograph: Google MapsDublin City Council has taken legal proceedings against large city centre pub Opium amid complaints from local residents and businesses following a multimillion euro makeover.The Mercantile Group establishment, which describes itself as a “pan-Asian restaurant, cocktail bar and nightlife destination” closed in May last year and reopened in January after a revamp estimated to have cost between €2 million and €4 million.In a recent letter to councillors, the Camden Village Residents’ \u0026amp Business Association said it had received an “unprecedented” number of noise complaints since the pub installed a rooftop smoking area and opening glass roof on its premises.Dublin City Council last month refused retention permission on the roof works and said it has now started legal proceedings over alterations that it says were carried out without proper planning permission.In its letter, the Camden association said “people cannot get a night’s sleep as the crowd noise from these open areas inside this venue can be heard very often until 2.30am or later”.It accused the Mercantile Group of behaving badly by failing to adhere to an enforcement notice issued by Dublin City Council last October.In response to a question from Fianna Fáil councillor Frank Kennedy, council management said “there is a live file on Opium, 26 Wexford Street”. “A Section 154 Notice was served on 13th October, 2017, requiring the removal of the steel structure and glazed roof and the reinstatement of the curved bitumen covered roof by 15th December, 2017. “The notice was not complied with and the matter is now the subject of legal proceedings.”A planning authority may issue a notice under section 154 of the Planning and Development Act if development does not have the required permission, or where terms of permission have not been met.The council said it refused to grant retention permission because the development gives rise to unacceptable noise levels and creates unacceptable noise levels which negatively affect the “residential environmental quality of the area”.The council carried out sound monitoring in the bedroom of a property on Camden Row over three days in February. “On each of these occasions crowd noise and music with a high bass content were clearly audible and at a level that would be considered intrusive,” the Dublin’s environmental health officer said.Opium is one of a number of Dublin establishments in the Mercantile hospitality group. Last year it lined up a €20 million investment programme, after its warring shareholder blocs formally ended a bitter legal wrangle.The Mercantile Group did not respond to a request for comment.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3463708.1523904133!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a new british centrist party could win over voters but not yet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew political movements, such as French president Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche, are disparaged for their intellectual vacuity – until they win. Photograph: Charles Platiau via APIf the worst thing that can happen to a new project is to be ignored, a party of the British centre ground has a chance, after all.The latest people to try, steered by the entrepreneur Simon Franks, are drenched from the Victoria Falls of cold water that has been poured on their idea. The yet-to-be-named party is doomed, say well-wishers, not just enemies, by its reliance on shop-soiled politicians from the recent past, its lack of ideas, its support from donors of the faceless, cat-stroking kind, its air of de haut en bas and its geographic spread of potential voters in an electoral system that rewards concentration.Some of these problems are more real than others. A wider donor base would make it harder for cynics, including Conservatives who should know better, to demonise this “rich man’s party”. But the Brexit campaign was not financed by the spare pennies of honest draymen either, and still won.As for ideas, lots of political movements are disparaged for their intellectual vacuity until they win. Tony Blair’s New Labour, David Cameron’s modernised Tories and Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche are just the most recent examples of vague but well-led platforms that carried the public. The inidual leader comes first. The ideas follow, and sometimes never do.The unavailability of such a leader is one of British centrism’s besetting curses, but there is an even more obvious problem. Nothing has happened yet. The hard but crucial thing to remember about the great age of populism, the historic rout of the centre, globalisation’s writhing ordeal, is that almost all of it is prospective. It amounts to a series of electoral shocks that have not had time to work much tangible effect on the governance of nations, and therefore on people’s lives.The implementation of Brexit is still years away, on the other side of a transitional phase. Fifteen months into his US presidency, Donald Trump’s foremost legislative achievement is a corporate tax cut that most of the hated “globalists” would drink up. Over the same period, the most notable policy change in Europe has been Macron’s attempted supply-side reform of France. Exactly what is a voter of the liberal centre meant to be mobilising against at this point, beyond the atmospheric change?The economist Robert Solow, unimpressed with the growth-boosting properties of information technology, once said that the computer age is everywhere but in the productivity statistics. The populist age is everywhere but on the statute book, at least for now. There have been some disturbing reversals for liberalism: in eastern and central Europe especially, and on the subject of immigration. But the overall balance of government policy in the democratic west, including Britain, has not changed drastically since the Year Zero of 2016.This can change, and probably will. But until it does, middle-ground voters are being invited to react against something that has not occurred – against the idea, not the felt reality, of illiberalism. It is too little to hang a new party on. No one calls the police because they fear a burglary in the medium-term future. It is the immediacy of a threat that concentrates the mind.Looking back, no one is surprised that an anti-globalisation movement failed to materialise in, say, 1980, when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had just been elected and the intellectual right was still talking a better game than it had legislated. Yet at an equivalent stage of this new populist era – if it turns out to be any such thing – the lack of a liberal resistance is seen as an ignominious failure. In fact, it is natural.The creation of a successful new party is not just difficult, it is mostly beyond anyone’s control. It requires a mating of historic circumstance and the human element, in the form of an outstanding inidual. All the same, Franks and his like are right to detect lots of unspoken-for voters in modern Britain. They are middle-income, largely apolitical workers who do not answer to the mystifying name “centrist”, but simply have a material interest in continuity. (Most people in work voted Remain.) They are frustrated by the world as it is, but do not believe it needs turning upside down.The trouble is, as of spring 2018, the world has not been upturned. Their material lives have not changed enough. As much as politics has pitched and yawed noisily in recent years, policy itself has not. If that changes, and these voters feel their hard-won living standards compromised by ideological hot-heads, watch the “insurmountable” barriers to a new centrism tumble. Voters cannot be persuaded of that which has yet to be felt. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Lantieri heard the news on a Sunday in January and the massive logistical and medical operation was swiftly launched.The donor face was transported as quickly as possible by road on the Monday to the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris.By late morning the following day, Hamon was being wheeled back to his hospital bed following the ground-breaking surgery, with his medical team noticing encouraging signs of good colour in his new face.The operation answers a key question for Lantieri and the rest of the medical world \u0026quotCan we redo a facial transplant?

ending Her Majesty’s close association with the breed dating back eight decades.The dog, which was 14th generation and descended from the Queen’s first dog Susan, was suffering from a cancer-related illness.It’s understood The Queen didn’t want Willow, who was almost 15, to suffer any further. Insiders said she was hit “extremely hard” by the loss of Willow, who had become her most devoted companion.  As a descendant of Susan, who was an 18th birthday present when she was then Princess Elizabeth, Willow had a particularly close link with the Queen.On her 90th birthday, when she posed for portraits with her grandchildren, she also let her dogs share the limelight. Willow was one of four dogs at the time who featured in a picture with her, taken on steps in the grounds of Windsor castle.Corgis have played a massive role in Her Majesty\u0026#39s lifeThe dog also featured in the now infamous James Bond sketch with Daniel Craig for the London Olympics opening ceremony, alongside Holly - who died at Balmoral aged 13 back in 2016.A Buckingham Palace source told the Daily Mail: “She has mourned every one of her corgis over the years, but she has been more upset about Willow’s death than any of them… It is probably because Willow was the last link to her parents and a pastime that goes back to her own childhood. It really does feel like the end of an era.”She does still have one last corgi, called Whisper, which she agreed to adopt after the death of his owner, who was a former Sandringham gamekeeper. She also has two dorgis – corgi-dachsund crosses – called Vulcan and Candy.It was reported that the Queen was still feeding and exercising Willow until the weekend, but the dog’s condition worsened. A vet was then said to have been called on Sunday afternoon, when Prince Philip was able to rejoin her after nearly two weeks in hospital following a hip operation.In 2015, the Queen decided to stop breeding Pembroke Welsh corgis over fears she might trip over and hurt herself over them. It was also reported that she didn’t want to leave any behind when she dies.Yet during her time looking after them, she has had more than 30 corgis stemming from Susan’s puppies Sugar and Honey, who were born in 1949.Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the reports, saying it would be a private matter.Please review our commenting policyFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Trump\u0026#39s intelligence chief had secret meeting with Kim Jong-unWoman nearly sucked out of plane after engine broke off and \u0026#39flew into window\u0026#39 mid-flight Children\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says NHS accused of \u0026#39alarming\u0026#39 failure to tackle cyber security despite growing Russian threatCommonwealth leaders pledge to renew fight against malaria\u0026#39Imagine the worst flu you\u0026#39ve ever had and times it by 10\u0026#39\u0026#39I lost two years of my education to malaria\u0026#39\u0026#39In Nigeria you can never escape malaria\u0026#39Paradise Hunters, review – the casting was so spot-on that a familiar formula never felt too tiredStephen: The Murder That Changed a Nation, review – a devastating account of incompetence and excusesLabour MPs tell Jeremy Corbyn \u0026#39enough is enough\u0026#39 over party\u0026#39s \u0026#39corrosive\u0026#39 anti-Semitism problemPrince Charles charms delegates as Royal Family\u0026#39s Commonwealth mission continuesMary Beard \u0026#39cut\u0026#39 from US version of Civilisations, fearing \u0026#39slightly creaky old lady isn\u0026#39t ideal for US TV\u0026#39Comment: For all its bluster about Syrian air strikes provoking armageddon, Russia has shown itself to be a paper tigerStudent who chose to have leg amputated for £5,000 targets ParalympicsEmoji \u0026#39ruining people\u0026#39s grasp of English\u0026#39 because young rely on them to communicateNew migraine treatment could help when other drugs fail Millions of IP addresses blocked as Russia tries to shut down TelegramWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"southwest airlines plane makes emergency landing engine broke","story":"A woman was almost sucked out of a Southwest Airlines plane yesterday when an engine broke off and smashed one of its windows mid-flight, killing a passenger.The passenger plane apparently blew an engine at about 30,000 feet and got hit by shrapnel that smashed the window and damaged the fuselage, killing one person and injuring seven others, authorities said.A crew member on the plane reported to air traffic controllers that a piece of the plane was missing and \u0026quotsomeone went out\u0026quot, AP reported.The flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airIn the audio recording of the exchange, the crew member said the plane needed to slow down.Photos posted by passengers showed a heavily damaged window near the damaged engine. Passengers reported seeing a woman being given medical attention on the plane.“One passenger, a woman, was partially … was drawn out towards the outside of the plane … was pulled back in by other passengers,\u0026quot Todd Burr, the father of another passenger, told NBC10.The plane\u0026#39s left engine appeared to have ripped offThe twin-engine Boeing 737 bound from New York to Dallas with 149 people on board, made an emergency landing in Philadelphia just before noon as passengers breathing through oxygen masks that dropped from the ceiling said their prayers and braced for impact.\u0026quotI just remember holding my husband\u0027s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,\u0026quot said passenger Amanda Bourman, of New York.\u0026quotAnd the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn\u0027t grow up without parents.\u0026quotNational Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt said one person was killed. Seven other people were treated for minor injuries, Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said. He said there was a fuel leak in one of the engines when firefighters arrived and a small fire was quickly brought under control.At least one passenger has been taken to hospitalThe Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window. The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.Ms Bourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask.\u0026quotEverybody was crying and upset,\u0026quot she said. \u0026quotYou had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, \u0027It\u0027s OK! We\u0027re going to do this!\u0027\u0026quotShe added that passengers clapped and praised the pilot after the aircraft touched down.Passenger Marty Martinez went on Facebook Live while wearing an oxygen mask. He posted, \u0026quotSomething is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!\u0026quot After the plane landed, he posted photos of a broken window near the left engine.The engine reportedly hit into and broke one of the plane\u0026#39s windowsMs Bourman said she saw emergency workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was then taken off the plane. She said that she also saw a man rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Passengers did \u0026quotsome pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances,\u0026quot Mr Thiel said.Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed Flight 1380 was heading west over Pennsylvania at about 32,200 feet (10 km) and traveling 500 mph (800 kph) when it abruptly turned toward Philadelphia.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s accident. It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.CFM said it sent technical experts to help NTSB investigators. In a statement, it said the CFM56-7B has had \u0026quotan outstanding safety and reliability record\u0026quot since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aricraft worldwide.A Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airJohn Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\u0026quotThere\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0026quot Goglia said. \u0026quotIn this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0026quot\u0026quotWe\u0027re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,\u0026quot he added. \u0026quotWe\u0027re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\u0027s why the containment ring is there.\u0026quotThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida. Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.NTSB investigators said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.Please review our commenting policyFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Trump\u0026#39s intelligence chief had secret meeting with Kim Jong-unChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesNHS accused of \u0026#39alarming\u0026#39 failure to tackle cyber security despite growing Russian threatCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says Commonwealth leaders pledge to renew fight against malaria\u0026#39In Nigeria you can never escape malaria\u0026#39\u0026#39Imagine the worst flu you\u0026#39ve ever had and times it by 10\u0026#39\u0026#39I lost two years of my education to malaria\u0026#39Queen devastated by loss of her last remaining corgi Paradise Hunters, review – the casting was so spot-on that a familiar formula never felt too tiredStephen: The Murder That Changed a Nation, review – a devastating account of incompetence and excusesLabour MPs tell Jeremy Corbyn \u0026#39enough is enough\u0026#39 over party\u0026#39s \u0026#39corrosive\u0026#39 anti-Semitism problemPrince Charles charms delegates as Royal Family\u0026#39s Commonwealth mission continuesMary Beard \u0026#39cut\u0026#39 from US version of Civilisations, fearing \u0026#39slightly creaky old lady isn\u0026#39t ideal for US TV\u0026#39Comment: For all its bluster about Syrian air strikes provoking armageddon, Russia has shown itself to be a paper tigerStudent who chose to have leg amputated for £5,000 targets ParalympicsEmoji \u0026#39ruining people\u0026#39s grasp of English\u0026#39 because young rely on them to communicateNew migraine treatment could help when other drugs fail Millions of IP addresses blocked as Russia tries to shut down TelegramWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/17/TELEMMGLPICT000160674119_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqby7LmKT1fuqERdwd71W_t3eI8XfvBguBpCNdlM2V704.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"student chose have leg amputated 5000 targets paralympics","story":"Hannah Moore has been fitted with a £10,000 revolutionary prosthetic \u0026#39cycling leg\u0026#39 by prosthetic company Dorset OrthopaedicA student who paid £5,000 to have her leg amputated after an ingrowing toenail left her battling sepsis now plans to compete in the Paralympics.Hannah Moore, 21, has been fitted with a £10,000 revolutionary prosthetic “cycling leg”, custom made to help her improve her times and qualify for Tokyo 2020 as a triathlete.Her family paid for her to have her right leg amputated below the knee two years ago after years of excruciating pain had left her in a wheelchair.She had undergone a routine procedure for an ingrowing toenail when she was 15 but it triggered a rare, debilitating condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) that blighted her life for four years.Miss Moore, from Sherborne, Dorset, a former national karate champion, suffered with severe pain and swelling as the blood vessels in her right foot became infected by sepsis. Ulcers formed on her foot and, despite more than 50 operations and numerous skin grafts, they would not heal.After years of excruciating pain, Hannah says having her amputation was \u0026#39the best decision I’ve ever made\u0026#39At that point she made the harrowing decision to have her right leg amputated to stop the pain, even though she was told there was no guarantee it would work. The NHS refused to carry out the operation on the grounds that it was not the recommended treatment for CRPS and that she could still be in pain afterwards. But other surgeons said there was a chance the operation would take away her pain.Miss Moore said that since the operation she had never looked back, had lost 4 st and was fitter than before. “Having my leg amputated was the best decision I’ve ever made,” she said. “The things I have achieved I would never have without this operation. The hardest times were before having my amputation, as I was having operations almost every week in London and the pain was so wearing.\u0026quot“Since, I’ve never felt sorry for myself. It’s all been about making the most out of a situation, showing to myself as much as anyone that a ‘disability’ doesn’t have to define what you can and can’t do.”Last August, the Yeovil College student became the British PTS4 paratriathlon champion and this year she will begin a sports and exercise degree at Loughborough University.Miss Moore, who will remove the artificial limb and replace it with a blade for the running part of a triathlon, added: “I am a British champion and now my dream is to compete in Tokyo.”Please review our commenting policyFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies

probeThe New York Attorney General has launched an investigation into 13 major cryptocurrency exchanges trading bitcoin and other digital currencies.The office of General Eric Schneiderman sent a letter to Coinbase, Gemini, Bit Trust and other exchanges, requesting more facts for investors and traders in this emerging market.The Virtual Markets Integrity initiative could bring about tighter regulation for cryptocurrency exchanges.“With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money,” said Attorney General Schneiderman.Yet too often, consumers don’t have the basic facts they need to assess the fairness, integrity, and security of these trading platforms. “Our Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative sets out to change that, promoting the accountability and transparency in the virtual currency marketplace that investors and consumers deserve.”Bitcoin boosted as IMF boss praises cryptocurrencyBitcoin price rockets by more than $1,000 in bizarre surgeExperts predict \u0027crazy’ price gains for bitcoinA questionnaire sent to each exchange requests information about trading policies and procedures, basic operation and fees, as well as controls to prevent money laundering and hacks.Although the initiative is designed to protect the interests of New York residents who trade cryptocurrency with these exchanges, the international nature of the businesses means the outcome of the probe could have wide-reaching consequences.The investigation comes just a day after International Monetary Fund (IMF) boss Christine Lagarde called for an even-handed approach to regulation in the cryptocurrency space. Ms Lagarde explained the global benefits of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency in an official blog on the IMF\u0027s website, saying that sensible regulatory measures could help realise the potential of digital currencies and their underlying technology. “Just as a few technologies that emerged from the dot-com era have transformed our lives, the crypto assets that survive could have a significant impact on how we save, invest and pay our bills,” Ms Lagarde wrote.“An important initial step will be to reach a consensus within the global regulatory community on the role crypto-assets should play. Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May hosts a meeting with leaders and representatives of Caribbean countries, at 10 Downing Street on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.Aneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The committee is minded to issue a formal summons for him to appear on a named day in the very near future.”The refusal came as the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into the scandal was told that the misuse of voters’ personal data was “rife” during the Brexit campaign.A former Cambridge Analytica employee alleged that the group Leave.EU may have also used data from the insurance businesses run by its funder Arron Banks, to target potential Brexit supporters.It may also have broken electoral law because work was done by Cambridge Analytica that was not paid for and because data from UK citizens appeared to have been processed abroad, Brittany Kaiser said.In written evidence, Ms Kaiser, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of programme development, said: “I now think that there is reason to believe that misuse of data was rife amongst the businesses and campaigns of Arron Banks.“If the personal data of UK citizens who just wanted to buy car insurance was used by GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance for political purposes, as may have been the case, people clearly did not opt in for their data to be used in this way by Leave.EU.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13“I have similar concerns about whether Ukip members consented to the use of their data.”Mr Nix was asked to make a second appearance before the fake news inquiry after telling it, in February, that Cambridge Analytica did not have or use Facebook data.It was then revealed that the personal information of at least 87 million people was harvested from Facebook by a company with a deal to share it with the London-based communications firm.Mr Collins demanded Mr Nix, who was suspended from his role as chief executive, return to be quizzed on “a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us”.Brexit: Commonwealth trade plans mocked as a ‘fool’s errand’ by MPWindrush scandal ‘deeply worrying’ for EU citizens, says VerhofstadtHow Brexit is set to cause chaos at Europe’s ports‘People’s Vote’ campaign group calls for referendum on Brexit dealHe warned that “giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter” and urged Mr Nix to “explain” his comments.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”In her evidence, Ms Kaiser said she believed the number of people whose data was harvested from Facebook was “much greater” than the 87 million acknowledged.And she claimed Cambridge Analytica, which she left in 2012, had created several of its own Facebook quizzes designed to harvest data from iniduals.They included a “sex compass” quiz, which would tell Facebook users what their “personal preferences” were, and a “music personality” quiz.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

russia","story":"International chemical weapons inspectors\u0026nbspfinally set to visit\u0026nbspsite of the\u0026nbspalleged attack in DoumaTheresa May has won a second symbolic vote on her decision to launch airstrikes after another day of fraught parliamentary debate on Syria.The prime minister’s advisers believe the result shows she has successfully navigated difficulties arising from her move to push ahead with a military operation without first consulting MPs.But Jeremy Corbyn used the debate to demand that the House of Commons “take back our control” of decisions to launch any military action, with a new “War Powers Act”.Theresa May says ‘element of surprise’ was crucial in Syria bombingThe development came as inspectors were set to finally make it to the site of the alleged Douma chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with Ms May accusing Moscow of preventing the scientists from doing their work.Ahead of the Commons vote on Syria, Ms May told MPs that coming to parliament before undertaking military action would “compromise the effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women”.She attacked the suggestion of a War Powers Act, claiming it would remove “vital flexibility” from situations which are “by definition unpredictable”.She went on: “Making it unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad.Syria bombing: EU ‘understands’ recent airstrikes but calls for ‘urgent’ resumption of peace talks“And, for as long as I’m prime minister, that will never be allowed to happen.”She concluded by saying that after two days of debate no one could doubt her commitment to be held accountable by parliament, and also that the tone of the debate had been supportive to the strikes.Chemical weapons inspectors have entered Douma, Syrian media says‘Very likely’ evidence disappearing from Douma site, France saysCorbyn leads debate in Parliament on Syria strikes- as it happenedMay defends Syria air strikes amid criticism over lack of voteTrump halts plans for new sanctions on Russia If May wants to help Syria she should accept more refugeesA vote related to the Syria action was already won by the government on Monday, though it was not on a substantive motion – one that explicitly seeks to approve the action or not.The motion of Tuesday’s vote, which stated the Commons has “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces”, was also neutral in tone.But Mr Corbyn called on his own MPs to vote against it, despite Labour having called the debate, to show opposition over how they believe the government sidelined parliament in relation to the military action.Before the motion was passed by 317 to 256, Mr Corbyn’s speech was met with bad tempered heckling from Tory MPs, who consistently tried to intervene while the Labour leader was talking.Kenneth Clarke criticises Theresa May for failure to consult parliament over Syria bombingSpeaker John Bercow gave warnings to Conservative backbenchers such as Alec Shelbrooke and Mark Harper during the course of the debate.Outlining his proposed War Powers Act, the Labour leader said it was for the Commons “to take matters into its own hands and take back our control”.He added: “There’s no more serious issue in decisions made by parliament on matters of war and peace, and the government taking planned military action.“That convention was established in 2003, it was enshrined in Cabinet in 2011, and the then the foreign secretary gave every indication that he supported the principle of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval of such a major step.“I’ve outlined the caveats that are there in a case of overriding emergency, but I do think it is very important that the House of Commons, as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, holds the government to account.”Earlier in the day the prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from reaching Douma.Russian officials at OPCW headquarters in The Hague later said arrangements were being made for the inspectors to travel to the site on Wednesday.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has flatly denied that Russia had “tampered” with the evidence, and insisted there is no proof that chemical weapons had even been used in Douma.Douma chemical attack: Syria war in picturesDouma chemical

dangerous development”.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Yury Filatov suggested the strikes were intended to impede the investigation so nobody would know the truth, adding that experts have not yet found any traces of chlorine or any other toxic agents.“As far as we can see there was no attack,” he said. “Not a single local resident was able to confirm that a chemical attack had actually taken place.”Mr Filatov said the suspected chemical attack had “definitely been staged”, and that the images had been “fabricated”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Last week he left the hospital for a weekend to visit his family in Brittany.“If I hadn’t accepted this new face it would have been terrible,” he told AFP news agency. ”It’s a question of identity... But here we are, it’s good, it’s me.”He added: “He never complained. We felt we were dealing with someone exceptional.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
