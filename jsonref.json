The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

The news comes as cases of the variant of concern first discovered in India continues to climb in Britain.  According to Reuters, a German government source said: “We want to play it safe. In this important phase of the vaccination campaign, the entry of problematic mutations must be avoided as far as possible.”Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister has said he asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to supply critical care nurses, respiratory therapists, and contact tracers on Friday.  Pallister added that Trudeau indicated he would provide all the support he could. According to Reuters, as vaccinations pick up across the country, the number of daily new cases has dropped by 25 per cent since last week - now averaging around 5,000, deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo told a briefing. So far, Canada has recorded a total of 25,111 deaths from Covid-19 and more than 1.3m cases overall.It is usually a rare disease, but more than 7,200 people in India have now been reported with mucormycosis and 219 have lost their lives. The rise in black fungus infections, mostly in patients who had severe cases of Covid-19, has been linked to an overuse of steroids in the treatment of the coronavirus, which can acutely compromise the immune system if taken over a prolonged period.  The high incidence of diabetes in India has also been blamed, with high blood sugar levels linked to susceptibility. India has the second-highest rate of diabetes in the world. It has also been reported in Covid patients who were on ventilators in intensive care units, due to their airways being exposed to humidity and moisture. More here on the rare infection:  According to Reuters, the summer holiday destinations, Slovenia and Croatia, would also no longer be classified as risk areas, the sources added.The European Union also pledged to donate 100m vaccine doses, while Germany and France will each give 30m.

The Indian government a day later issued a statement saying media reports using the term “Indian Variant” were without any basis, saying the WHO had classified the variant as just B.1.617.  In a letter to social media companies on Friday, the IT ministry asked the companies to “remove all the content” that names or implies “Indian variant” of the coronavirus.  A senior Indian government source told Reuters the notice was issued to send a message “loud and clear” that such mentions of “Indian variant” spread miscommunication and hurt the country’s image.  The IT ministry could not be reached for comment.  Around the world, coronvirus variants have generically been referred to by doctors and health experts on the basis of where the are identified. This includes South Africa, Brazil and UK variants. Washington last year invoked the wartime powers of the Defense Production Act to preserve vaccine raw materials for its own companies, a move which hindered production elsewhere.  “I am pretty sure the US will take off their vaccine barriers now. There are plenty of vaccinations now,” Draghi told reporters at the end of a global health summit where poorer nations complained about an unfair distribution of jabs.  The overall number of Covid patients in hospital also fell again to just over 20,000.  France also reported 109 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, compared with 173 on Friday last week, and 305 on Friday three weeks ago.Britain’s biggest airport said it would introduce the dedicated arrivals facility in Terminal 3 from 1 June. It follows increasing disquiet over incoming flights, particularly from India, where the B.1.617.2 variant was first detected. Under the new traffic light system, only returning UK citizens are allowed to fly home from red list countries, while holidays are permitted in green list countries – and potentially amber, with quarantine measures. Ministers had urged Heathrow to segregate arrivals from higher-risk countries, with the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, saying on Thursday he wanted to “see people separated out as much as is practically possible”. With many more passengers expected in coming weeks, after holidays were permitted to resume on 17 May, the airport said it would create the facility to help smooth the immigration process. Although the airport said the current system – designed by the government – had built-in protection, there have been reports of long queues in immigration halls and experts have questioned the safety of travel with passengers from around the world mixing in airports. Border Force officials have had to spend much more time than before processing documentation, including pre-departure Covid test certificates from abroad. At the moment, the only EU country on that list is Portugal.  The government will review its traffic light evaluation of countries in the first week of June. Shapps urged people longing for holidays in France and elsewhere in Europe to be “a little patient”, telling the FT:  Asked whether people should travel to countries currently coded amber, Shapps said: “Don’t do it.” I’m Jedidajah Otte and am taking back over now.

If we’ve missed anything, do send over any thoughts, ideas or tips to rachel.hall@theSpeaking at an online meeting of the Independent Sage group of experts, professor Ravi Gupta of the University of Cambridge said that despite the UK’s vaccination programme, cases of B.1.617.2 are set to rise.  “We still have people under the age of 30 not vaccinated, we have many with only one dose, so this virus has plenty of space to expand exponentially and reach very high levels of infection with quite high levels of morbidity overall,” he said. His comments come as data from the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium reveals that the India variant has been detected in 4,717 positive Covid samples to date, with the India variant found in around a fifth of analysed positive specimens dating to within the past 28 days.  The rise has also been reflected in case data, which unlike the Cog-UK data does not include potential duplicates, with figures released by Public Health England (PHE) last night revealing there have now been 3,424 confirmed cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in the UK, up from 1,313 cases confirmed by last Thursday. Both of these datasets are likely to underestimate the current situation as there is a time lag between samples being collected and the variant in positive tests being determined. Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London, who is a member of the Independent sage group of experts said the rise in cases of the India variant is not yet fully reflected in overall Covid case numbers because of the decline in cases of the Kent variant that has been dominating in the UK. Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO who is also a member of Independent Sage noted that while Covid vaccines appear to offer protection against the variant, some people can still become very ill with the disease. The CBC cited a formal Notice to Airmen issued by civil aviation authorities. Ottawa first announced the ban on 22 April as cases of Covid-19 in India soared.

File photograph: Colin Keegan Collins DublinThe Indian variant of Covid-19 poses a threat to the progress made in suppressing the virus, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is closely monitoring variants of concern and is “concerned” about possible higher transmissibility of the Indian variant and its spread in other countries, as well as early reports of its impact on vaccine effectiveness, Dr Holohan said.“The public are keeping the disease under control and the HSE is increasing the number of people vaccinated every day. But the variant may nevertheless pose a risk to the progress we have made. Nphet will keep a close eye on this as we move towards the end of May and consider the advice we need to provide to Government on any further easing of restrictions.“For the most part, the sky is mostly blue but with a black cloud on the horizon which is the Indian variant,” Dr Holohan said.Nphet was “genuinely concerned” about this variant, particularly in the light of new evidence from\u0026nbspPublic Health England suggesting vaccines may be less effective against it after a first dose.Asked whether the UK should be added to the list of countries for which mandatory hotel quarantine was required due to the number of Indian variant cases, Dr Holohan said you would have to be concerned about the “significant quantity” of transmission there. Nphet would keep the matter under review.A further 524 cases of Covid-19 patients were reported by Nphet on Friday. Further Covid-related data is unavailable due to the cyber-attack on the HSE.The number of people hospitalised and in ICU is stable, the daily incidence is stable and the amount of people protected through vaccination continues to grow, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group.“We have confidence that if we can continue to limit transmission of Covid-19 through our inidual behaviour and compliance to public health advice, the vaccination effect will lead us to further easing of measures in the near future.”A total of 72 cases of the Indian variant, B.1.617.2, have been identified in Ireland, according to Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory.“Given the size of our unvaccinated population and the apparent transmissibility of this variant, we would encourage people to remain vigilant and to continue to adhere to the public health guidance as the vaccine programme rolls out.”Most people who are not yet vaccinated are continuing to be cautious, according to Prof Pete Lunn, of the behavioural research unit of the Economic and Social Research Institute. “Our data are consistent with the majority of people waiting until they are vaccinated before increasing their activity again.”Dr Holohan again urged Leaving Cert students to be cautious ahead of their exams in order to avoid the risk of infection.On Friday morning, 107 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of which 38 were in ICU.

And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Asif HassanAFP via GettyThe interval between doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine is being reduced from 16 weeks to 12 weeks, according to the Health Service Executive.The interval will be reduced progressively from May 24th, HSE officials told a briefing on Thursday.On proposals to reduce the age from which people can receive the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines from 50 to 40 years, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said these would require “significant change” to the operational model being used up to now in the vaccine rollout.A move to a “choice-based model” – as people would be able to opt for other vaccines if they did not wish to get the AstraZeneca and Janssen doses – would mark a different approach to the one used up to now.Mr Reid said this would require careful consideration. There are “some concerns” over the delivery schedule for the Janssen vaccine, he pointed out, with just 60,000 doses received so far. Supply details for June are not yet available.A further 18 cases of the B.1617.2 variant first identified in India have been identified in Ireland, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry told the briefing, bringing to 59 the total number of cases. In addition, 22 cases of another sub-type, B.1617.1, have been found.While this was of some concern, the measures taken in Ireland have slowed down the spread of the variant, he said, thereby allowing the vaccination programme to “run through the population” as quickly as possible.Mr Reid said 43 per cent of the adult population had received one vaccine dose, with more than 2.2 million vaccines having been administered up to Wednesday.This includes 1.6 million people who have received their first dose. Last Thursday saw the highest number of vaccines administered to date, 56,000.Missing GP dataSome 250,000 vaccines were administered last week but this did not include data from GPs, which could not be included because of the cyber attack.Over 320,000 people in their sixties, and 186,000 in the 50-59 age group, have received their first dose of vaccine.At the start of the week, the 14-day incidence of Covid-19 was 124 cases per 100,000 population. Kildare, Donegal and Dublin had the highest county incidences Sligo had the lowest.No coronavirus-related deaths were reported in the Republic on Thursday but 469 new cases were confirmed. In Northern Ireland there were no additional deaths linked to Covid-19 but 90 further cases were confirmed.Ministers in the North have given the go-ahead for significant relaxation of the Covid-19 rules in Northern Ireland from Monday.From May 24th indoor hospitality will be allowed to reopen with mitigations, and up to six people from no more than two households are allowed to meet inside private homes for the first time since Christmas.Also permitted is the reopening of indoor visitor attractions, libraries and the remainder of the travel and tourism industry, receptions following weddings and civil partnerships, school extracurricular activities, indoor group exercise and training and the full return of outdoor sport.The number of people allowed to gather outdoors has been increased to 500, subject to a risk assessment, and up to 500 spectators are permitted at outdoor events."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew mcginley what gets me out of bed is my love for them","story":"Andrew McGinley with his three children Conor (9), Darragh (7) and Carla (3). ‘My mantra is, “I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.”’ “For me what happened to the kids was an act of insanity. I can’t see it any other way. I can’t understand it any other way,” says Andrew McGinley, the father of Conor (9), Darragh (7) and Carla (3), whose mother Deirdre Morley was found not guilty of their murder by reason of insanity in the Central Criminal Court on Thursday.In the well-kept home in Newcastle, Co Dublin, they shared as a family before their world shattered on January 24th, 2020, the children’s presence is still everywhere. They are in the completed Lego sets displayed in Perspex boxes on the windowsill, the paintings on the wall, bean bags in the front room that he recently had repaired and refilled – because he could not bear to part with them. They are in the Marvel jigsaw on the kitchen table that the boys never got to finish. It went awry after Carla tried to help with it, he remembers with a sad smile.He has begun to distribute some of their toys to people who might benefit from them, but there are certain things he has held on to. He has kept a small pile of toys to give in time to their mother Deirdre, or “Dee” as he still calls her.“There’s a lot of emotions, there’s a lot of difficult and complicated emotions. But for me, I want to live a positive life.”He has to pause for a moment.“And I want to do that, you know, in order to keep their memories alive . . . Because you could get could get swallowed up by everything else and at times I do,” he says, his voice breaking again.“My mantra is, ‘I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.’ So yeah, sometimes I have to remind myself that . . . I want to move forward positively.”This week has been hard, but “the trial for me was a process that had to happen. For me, nothing is more difficult than finding your three children dead,” he says.In a statement issued after the verdict, he said he was no closer to understanding why his children had died. What he does know is that their mother loved them. The court heard repeatedly that they were “very, very deeply loved” and “cherished”.“I can see now, Dee, she didn’t want me to know the full extent of her illness. And certainly for her family as well, she wanted to put her best foot forward,” he says.“You’re sitting in the courtroom, you’re listening to some of the counselling sessions she had with the professional services, and you’re seeing a totally different person, and you’re hearing about a totally different person. So I think the two parties needed to come together, the professional services and the support circle. I would be convinced had that happened, that Conor, Darragh and Carla would be alive today.”He now wants an inclusive investigation into her diagnosis, treatment and medication prior to the family tragedy to help the family “understand the insanity” that took his children’s lives.The court heard that his wife was diagnosed as suffering from a moderate depressive illness prior to the children’s deaths. The psychiatrists who gave evidence before the court came to slightly differing conclusions regarding her diagnosis. One, Brenda Wright, diagnosed her with bipolar affective disorder type II. Mary Davoren said it was difficult to diagnose her but “at a minimum she suffered from a recurring depressive disorder”.Within a few weeks of her admission to the Central Mental Hospital in January 2020, Deirdre Morley felt back to the “real me” on an anti-psychotic that she described as a “wonder drug”.“It would make sense to involve families more in the care of anybody with a mental health illness, because you are relying on responses that can possibly be skewed by the illness. For us as a family, we’re sitting in the courtroom, we were listening to the evidence from the two expert witnesses and we’ve just ended up with more questions than at the start of the trial,” he says.“When we look at the medical records, we can see flags raised and we’ve just been left with questions. I have been in touch with Dee, and I’ve met Dee, but I’m not going to comment further.”He says “the trial was never going to give me the answers I needed, it was an act of insanity I’ve accepted that . . . I don’t think you can come to any other conclusion.”But what he wants is for “the professional services who were treating Dee, over the last couple of years prior to the children dying, to meet with me and the Morley family, so that we can understand. We’re left with an awful lot of questions that this trial was never going to answer, but we need those answers . . . We all thought she was getting the best care, and we hope that she was, but we have questions.”He wants lessons learned about the need for a “more inclusive and collaborative approach with families. I would strongly recommend to anybody who has a loved one within the care of the mental health services, they need to get in there and become an advocate for their care, they need to be aware of their treatment, their medication, all the facts, everything.”But for now, he is focused on “living a positive life” for the children.This has meant fulfilling promises he made to the children. In Conor’s case that was a promise to help him set up a YouTube channel. Conor was “quiet enough” but creative and funny. He remembers a day he spent with Conor not long before he died, noticing “he was turning into a wee man . . . he was a smart kid and a sensible kid and he had such a great sense of humour.”He promised seven-year-old Darragh he would start coaching Rathcoole boys football team, something he has done. He is surprised whenever he is asked if it is painful to be around his sons’ friends. “It’s funny that people would think that way. I enjoy it.”As for Carla, “she could have bought and sold the world”, he says his eyes filling with tears again. He promised her that he would make a snowman with her one day. In her name, he’s going to organise a snowman colouring competition. “Because they died so young, maybe in a way it’s giving them life.”For all the unfathomable depths of his grief, it gives him solace to know that his children knew they were loved and that no matter how busy he was with work, he always made time for them. “If you have kids, they’re your family. All five of you. I used to try and get home to take my last call at home,” he says.“If I saw them on the trampoline, I’d go out and join them . . . I don’t think there was a playground in the whole of Dublin that we hadn’t visited at one stage or another. We were always doing stuff.”In his darkest moments – and there are many, like Father’s Day, which was for him the lowest point – what gives him hope is “thinking about the kids and doing all these projects. Some days, the alarm goes off, and I try to keep a routine going, and what gets me out of bed is my love for them, quite simply.”The other things that has provided some comfort over the past year has been the kindness of other people. He also understands that some people have found it too difficult to be around him.“There’s people that I haven’t seen since the funeral. People who would have been here for the wake, I haven’t seen them since. And you know, I’m okay with that. And I just think maybe they feel awkward, or maybe they don’t know what to say. Nobody does. A lot of people would have said to me, ‘I don’t know what to say here’. And I always responded the same way. ‘So let’s start with hello. And we’ll take it from there.’ ”Somebody sent him a “grief graph”, outlining the various stages that they thought he would experience. But for him, there are no neat stages, there is just trying to find a way to keep going. “We’re all so different. And we will all deal with it in our own way. And I do know that some people may think I should be curled up in a ball instead of being on Twitter. But I’m on Twitter because Conor wanted to be online, and wanted to be there. So I’m trying to do that for him.”He will keep going so that he can keep the children’s memories alive. “To do that, it is the charity, As Darragh Did, it’s Conor’s Clips (the YouTube account), it is the snowman for Carla, it is the books. That’s what I have to do. And that’s what I want to do. My mantra is, ‘I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.’ Sometimes I have to remind myself of that.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"plan for return of events and overseas travel to be announced next week","story":"The Taoiseach said an announcement would be made next week in relation to overseas travel, as well as the entertainment sector and live events. File image: Dara Mac Donaill  The An increase in the vaccination rate this month could create possibilities for overseas travel, as well as live events potentially in June and July, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at Government Buildings on Friday, he said the State was on course to vaccinate over 1 million people during the month of May alone.Mr Martin said over 290,000 people over 50 years of age received a vaccine jab last week, that 280,000 people would receive it this week and an estimated 290,000 would receive it next week.“The vaccination programme is going very well with a very strong momentum,” he said.The Taoiseach indicated that a higher number of vaccinations could allow for some positive news when the Government makes its “comprehensive” statement next week on the further reopening of society and sectors of the economy.“Anything we reopen we will keep open,” he said.He said that in addition to the early June reopening of accommodation and wider reopenings on June 7th, including outdoor dining, there would also be announcement “in relation to travel, and also in areas around the entertainment sector, live events, what is possible in June and July”.He said: “We will be trying to give a sense to people in those key sectors which have been significantly hit up until now what will be possible.”He said discussions would take place on Monday and Tuesday with issues to be ironed out, ahead of an announcement in mid week.Asked about the Indian variant of Covid-19, rates of which in the UK are causing concern among public health officials here, Mr Martin said the Government was tracking it very closely and he had been briefed on it by the British prime minister Boris Johnson during their meeting last week.He said 42 per cent of adults had their first dose of the vaccine and 15 per cent had received two doses. “That gives strong protection already in reducing severe illness. Our hospitalisation numbers are steady… It reflects the impact of vaccination.”He added the EU Council meeting next week would be dealing with the Europe-wide green certificate for travel.“Vaccination will make a difference in relation to travel options,” he said but refrained from naming a date for the reopening of foreign travel from Ireland.‘Wet pubs’Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin has said she was “hopeful” that an announcement will be made shortly on supports for thousands of so-called “wet pubs” across the country to enable them to serve during the summer.Speaking on Friday, Ms Martin told reporters that the situation was “more complex” than for venues that serve food, but she is confident that progress is being made on the issue of supports for pubs that don’t have a dining option.“I’m hopeful that very shortly there will be an announcement that will be of benefit to thousands of wet pubs across the country in relation to supports.”She said also that she hopes the Government will next week produce a roadmap for international tourism. “It is really critical for tourism to recover, it accounts for 75 per cent of the tourism revenue and I’m acutely aware of that,” she said.She said she would be advocating for indoor dining to return “as soon as possible in July” due to its “critical importance to the industry”, but said the Government would be reminded of the public health advice in this area, and would hope to bring more certainty to the situation next week.She said “we’re entering a period of hope when it comes to opening up the sector”, but that supports for the most impacted sectors, including the tourism and arts sectors in her own brief, would not be confronted with a cliff edge.“All of that will be examined in the context of the national economic recovery plan, and I’d hope that would be announced shortly, and that will address the sectors that have been most impacted.”“You have to look at the off-peak period as well and the supports needed... and that’s what I’ll be examining and considering with my Cabinet colleagues.”Ms Martin, who is also deputy leader of the Green Party, said she would like to test-run live performances in June rather than July. “We want to get them back performing and working again and I would hope to have some indication on that next week when we make the announcements on Friday.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"staff cannot insist people entering public offices wear face masks ahcps says","story":"By law a person must wear a face covering on public transport, banks, post offices, credit unions, shops, hair saloons and bookies. Photograph: iStockStaff in the Department of Social Protection cannot insist that people entering its public offices wear face masks due to a gap in existing legislation, higher civil servants have maintained.The Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants (AHCPS) at its annual conference on Friday expressed strong concern for the safety of its members and the public as a result of public offices being excluded from the official list of locations where face coverings are mandatory.Des Henry of the union’s Department of Social Protection branch said statutory instrument 296 of 2020 made it by law that a person must wear a face covering on public transport, banks, post offices, credit unions, shops, hair saloons and bookies but that this was not the case in public offices across the public service.AHCPS assistant general secretary Billy Thompson said the situation was bizarre and defied logic.“On the one hand it is mandatory to wear face covering mask in a supermarket or bank or post office but in a public office it is optional .”“This train was coming down the tracks since before Easter. It was anticipated that the matter would be tidied up before further re-opening . Instead it has been let slide.”He said the association was “extremely concerned about the safety of our members and all staff in offices”. He said the current situation was also unfair to the public. Mr Thompson said some members of the public “would choose to be vigilant and compliant with best practice, (but ) certain groups and iniduals have and will be provocative and confrontational if asked voluntarily to wear a mask”.“ This is currently a live issue in our Intreo offices in the Department of Social Protection which have had expanded hours since mid May. But it also applies to every other public office in the State as they re-open.”The Department of Social Protection said on Friday that it took very seriously the health and welfare of its staff and its clients and that the issue raised by the AHCPS was being kept under review. “Regulations mandating the wearing of face coverings were introduced initially for public transport and shops. Government buildings were not included in these regulations as it was considered that entrance by the public was controlled and social distancing was rigorously enforced. ““The Department’s policy is to adhere strictly to all public health guidelines including social distancing. Additionally, Perspex screens were installed in all open hatches and reception desks. “It said the practice in its Intreo centres was that customers were advised to wear masks. “This is displayed on posters at entrances. Additionally, customers without masks are offered one at the entrance. The rate of compliance has been very good with few incidents of refusal. In most cases refusal is based on medical grounds which would be the same under regulations.”The association also expressed its frustration and unhappiness at what it said was staff in the grades it represents (assistant principal officers and principal officers) being treated much less favourably to other public service personnel in successive national pay awards.Nigel Hutson of the Department of Foreign Affairs branch also said it was unacceptable and “it’s quite nauseating really” to see some senior iniduals “who advocate pay restraint being awarded inflated pay rises at this time of national crisis”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Big weddings are back on from June 21, Boris Johnson to announceLord Hall faces calls to resign as National Gallery chairman over Bashir scandalBarristers in bun fight over prep school shattering silence at Gray’s InnExclusive: Britain will regain mastery of political warfare after taking ‘eye off ball’ over Russian threatLady Nourse\u0026#39s friends demand explanation for charges as they say ordeal has \u0026#39utterly destroyed\u0026#39 herBack off from Princess Diana interview to give Martin Bashir a \u0026#39clear run\u0026#39, BBC\u0026#39s royal editor toldAustralia trade deal poses ‘high level of risk’ to British farmers, Boris Johnson warnedSupermarkets pocket millions in ‘bags for life’ profits as charities miss outSpain will allow unvaccinated Britons to visit without restrictions from MondayWhy Joe Biden’s call to waive vaccine patents will harm drug developmentComment: William is quietly winning the battle of the royal brothersGP surgeries with few face-to-face appointments must justify their actionsHomeowners may have to improve energy efficiency before selling under new green plansComment: Free trade has done far more for the poor than socialismPrince William’s intervention 25 years in the making – and inspired by desire to be mother’s protectorMI5 would struggle to cope with widespread violence in Northern Ireland, admits chiefWatch: Duke of Cambridge takes penalties during Edinburgh visit just hours after heavy criticism of BBCEurope\u0026#39s biggest bank charged with laundering \u0026#39ill-gotten\u0026#39 funds for African dictatorThe Beano to replace character Fatty with Freddy to stop children using name as insult for overweight peersPolice officer who used warrant card to accost female jogger keeps job despite gross misconduct findingBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis bridge north koreas secretive border says chinas cold","story":"In the middle of a bridge soaring over the Yalu River in northeast China is a white line painted on the ground, flanked by surveillance cameras, traffic lights and a blue sign indicating the destination ahead: North Korea.For now, the crossing in the border city of Dandong remains quiet, though it’s poised to soon become busy with traffic. Workers began conducting safety inspections last week – preparations that suggest the long-delayed New Yalu River Bridge may soon open, allowing official trade to resume between China and North Korea, which closed its borders after the coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan.

Under President Joe Biden, the US has ramped up efforts to court Asian allies, including Japan and South Korea, in efforts to bolster cooperation on the North Korean nuclear threat and China’s growing influence. On Friday, Mr Biden will welcome South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Washington for an official visit. The meeting could shed light on the US approach, as the Biden administration has been reviewing how to deal with North Korea – with more sanctions, summits or both. The visit also comes as ties between Washington and Beijing have frayed, potentially making China less inclined to collaborate on dealing with North Korea – even though its leaders are concerned about the nuclear threat. China’s ties to the North helped to blunt the impact of United Nations sanctions meant to deter Kim Jong-un’s nuclear ambitions. Smuggling routes and legal trade along the 880-mile border supplied North Korean markets and factories with building materials, machine parts, fuel, food and consumer goods. But the North’s decision to seal its border over coronavirus concerns has been crippling. From January 2020 through the first quarter of this year, China’s official trade with North Korea crashed to $550 million (£400 million), compared to $2.8 trillion in 2019. Chinese exports to North Korea dropped to $3,000 in February, the lowest in years. “Clearly the situation inside, in North Korea, is dire, so it stands to reason we’re at a point that some relaxation (of the border closure) might happen,” said Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korea Studies at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. Re-opening trade with China could also indicate that North Korea may ramp up weapons testing again, after a relatively quieter period during the coronavirus pandemic. ”They’re not testing not because they’ve had a change of heart, but because they’re dealing with domestic crises,” said John Park, director of the Korea Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. “They hit the pause button, and if they stabilise and are going to open up bits of trade, that’s a sign they’ve figured out a way to manage this.”Then, “does that mean they take their fingers off the pause button? Does that mean they go back to doing what they said they were going to do before Covid, and that was to demonstrate more potent capabilities?”North Korea has recently again started using shows of force, firing off two short-range ballistic missiles in March – its first such launches in a year, and in defiance of UN Security Council bans on ballistic missile tests. Rumours among traders in Dandong on when border crossings might be allowed again range from next month to early next year. Exactly when depends on the North’s risk appetite with coronavirus. Officially, Pyongyang has told the World Health Organisation that it has had zero cases, though experts doubt the veracity of its claims. Either way, there are signs in the city – spliced from the hermit kingdom by the Yalu River, lined with watchtowers and border guards with guns and masks – that China is laying the groundwork for trading with North Korea.The government of Liaoning province, where Dandong is located, invited bids in March for the safety inspection the  found was underway. Official procurement documents said that the New Yalu River Bridge – a three-kilometre stretch connecting China to North Korea – was “about to be put into operation.Another tender notice, also from March, sought contractors to build a cargo inspection area, logistics warehouse and other facilities to support port operations on the Chinese side of the bridge. Many in Dandong are eager for the border to re-open and activity to resume. Three street vendors told the  that they were running out of smuggled North Korean cigarettes to sell. Few restaurants stock Taedonggang, a beer produced by a state-owned North Korean brewery.Shopkeepers, desperate to make a sale, are quick to offer discounts to passersby – soaps, perfumes, noodles, handbags, and vitamins that North Koreans going back and forth used to buy. An elderly woman who tailors traditional Korean robes was praying in her shop one morning for customers to return.Before the border closure, North Koreans would place large orders for colourful outfits ranging from 170 yuan (£20) for children to 3,600 yuan (£400) for high-end women’s dresses. But these days she’s lucky to sell smaller textiles, such as makeup pouches for 10 yuan (£1.10) each, to Chinese tourists. “Business has been terrible,” she said, making it difficult to cover her monthly shop rent of 3,000 yuan (£330). “I hope the border opens soon.”  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beano replace character fatty freddy stop children using name","story":"It is Britain’s longest-running children’s comic which brought to life enduring characters such as Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx.However, The Beano has now decided to stop using the name of one of its most popular personalities to avoid offending young readers.From this week\u0027s issue (number 4087), the character Frederick Brown will no longer be referred to as \u0027Fatty in The Bash Street Kids comic strip.Instead he will exclusively be called Freddy - or perhaps Frederick if he is being told off by his mother.The creators made the change 67 years after the character was first introduced in a bid to ensure fans are not upset if they are overweight, or to inadvertently encourage youngsters to poke fun at their peers who struggle with their weight.Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, said: Kids come in all shapes and sizes, and we absolutely celebrate that. We don\u0027t want to risk someone using it in a mean way. The time is right to revert back to Freddy.“We\u0027ve recently received a number of letters from kids asking us why Frederick Brown was called Fatty, by himself and his classmates. Although it\u0027s always been used affectionately, and never pejoratively, we agreed it\u0027s time it changed. Freddy\u0027s mum - and teacher - may still sometimes address him as \u0027Frederick\u0027, whenever he\u0027s in trouble, which for a Bash Street Kid is not uncommon.Much like in 1954, when The Bash Street Kids were created based upon the hilarious antics spotted in the school yard outside of the Beano office, kids are still the inspiration for our characters and storylines and it\u0027s incredibly important to us that they see themselves and their lives reflected in Beanotown.”Run by Dundee-based publishing house DC Thomson since 1938, The Beano and its stablemate The Dandy are among the few surviving relics of Britain’s post-war comics boom.The Bash Street Kids characters in The Beano, illustrated by David Sutherland, are notoriously unruly nine-year-old pupils at Bash Street School. Fatty appears alongside Spotty, Danny, Toots, Sidney, Plug, ‘Erbert, Wilfrid and Smiffy.He is drawn as a morbidly obese, balding boy who carries around a bag of cakes. His prized possession is an apron signed by veteran television chef Mary Berry and his motto is \u0027Everything is delicious\u0027, according to his character profile.Mr Stirling insisted that Freddy will still be drawn in the same way, and won\u0027t be depicted thinner.All the characters overindulge at times, and Freddy is no different, he said.The Beano\u0027s move received a mixed reaction, with some arguing it was overzealous to drop the name Fatty and questioning how much of a role the comic could have really played in encouraging children to use the term as an insult for their overweight peers.Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP and Leader of the House of Commons, said: I expect it is just publicity seeking - otherwise it is comically woke.Others said it was a positive step, with one parent claiming the name had always jarred with her nine-year-old.Debbie Watson, founder of the eating disorder charity Wednesday’s Child, said it was helpful for popular publications to reflect on the message sent out by their content.“Any move which makes creators of literary, visual or social content consider how they are potentially impacting the self-esteem and mental wellbeing of their audience can only be seen as a good thing, she said.While we would never say that an eating disorder is solely caused by derogatory comments about a person’s size, it’s absolutely true that many adults we help, and indeed children, have found themselves triggered into developing poor relationships with food in a bid to escape the cruel labels they received.It seems only right that long-running publications like The Beano should want to reflect on what their characters are called, what message that sends, and whether it is appropriate for the kind of narrative we would want all young people to be using when talking about their friends or classmates.There is an opportunity in this move by the comic to ensure that they rethink not only the name of the character, but also how the storylines reflect the shape and size of all those who are part of The Bash Street Kids, because, as an eating disorder organisation, we continually feel the need to reiterate the message that people of all sizes and shapes can have a devastating eating disorder.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"binmen union submits emergency motion support suspended batley","story":"When a teacher was suspended from his school after showing a picture of the Prophet Mohammed in class, he reportedly felt as though he had been “thrown under a bus”.The National Education Union (NEU), was accused of failing to stand up for its own member after it did not immediately condemn the threats of violence and intimidation he faced in the wake of the row.But now, the Batley Grammar School religious studies teacher has found unlikely support from a Bury branch of Unite, which largely represents binmen.Brian Bamford, secretary of Tameside Trade Union Council, has submitted an emergency motion for the National Conference of Trade Union Councils in June to champion the cause of the suspended teacher.The motion urges the NEU and all other unions to support the teacher and to publicly condemn those demanding his dismissal.It notes that blasphemy laws were abolished more than a decade ago, and adds that “dogmatic restraints” should not be imposed on the religious education  curriculum.Mr Bamford is also secretary of Bury Unite commercial branch in the North West, which represents binmen across the borough, and the motion’s wording had to be approved by the branch committee before being passed up to the Tameside TUC which it is affiliated to.This is a motion which has come in from bin men, from ordinary working people, said Mr Bamford, a retired electrician who has been active in the trade union movement since the 1970s.“As far as I can see, staying silent goes contrary to what we believe in at our branch, and especially in the trade congress.“We are affiliated to the Orwell Society and freedom of expression is very important. I don’t feel guilty in any way for taking a stand on this issue.”Mr Bamford claimed that an NEU official attempted to pressurise him into withdrawing the motion on the basis that it was “unhelpful” to draw further attention to the issue.He said he was phoned by the official who asked him to reconsider the motion since it risks inflaming what is an extremely sensitive and very complex situation for members.Mr Bamford was told that the NEU has an obligation to the “wider community in Batley and that any further attention on the matter would set back quite sensitive negotiations.But he said he has no intention of abandoning the motion, adding that the school curriculum should not be “dictated by an indignant mob” who congregated outside Batley Grammar School just before the Easter break.“We are troubled that a teacher can be suspended following protests about his teaching methods and use of materials,” Mr Bamford said.“We are outraged that the teachers involved are being challenged for trying to broaden their students\u0027 horizons and encourage their critical thought.“We don\u0027t believe that the determination of the use of teaching resources in a school should be influenced by people taking offence, and using intimidation and threats.”Batley Grammar School sent pupils home early for the Easter holidays and issued an apology after a group of Muslims gathered at the gates to protest. The headmaster announced that the religious studies teacher had been suspended while the school looked into what happened.The 29-year-old teacher and his family went into hiding after reportedly receiving death threats in the wake of the protests. The academy trust that runs Batley Grammar School announced at the end of March that it would carry out an “independent” investigation into the context in which the cartoon was shown.A by-election has been triggered in Batley after Tracy Brabin stepped down as MP when she was elected as West Yorkshire\u0027s first metro mayor.Ms Brabin, 60, replaced Jo Cox as Batley and Spen MP in a by-election in 2016 after Ms Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist. The seat will be seen as a key test for Labour after the party lost the Hartlepool by-election to the Conservatives earlier this month.An NEU spokesperson said: It is a sensitive issue and the NEU did ask for the motion to be withdrawn. With every viewpoint that is expressed our members face yet more public exposure.They added that speculation is unhelpful, not least for our members who the NEU are fully supporting throughout this investigation and will be doing so beyond the investigation. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gps roles might evolving bma isnt helping acting like doesnt","story":"In the current row over face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries, the NHS authorities are right to say that GPs should offer face-to-face appointments. The concerns of patients as reported in the  and other newspapers are real. General practice cannot command public confidence if there is a perception that face-to-face appointments are not available for people who need them.During the early waves of the pandemic, it was essential for GPs to make a concerted shift to telephone consultations. Without that, they would have been able to deliver only a fraction of their normal service. If a variant of the disease again threatens to overwhelm health services, then telephone consultations will again play an essential role. But when the level of threat is lower, face-to-face appointments must be part of the offer. As Professor Nick Bosanquet of Imperial College London has said, part of the new system could be to offer a telephone line which is always available for urgent calls.However, GPs may be right to feel unhappy that their extraordinary work during the pandemic seems to have been forgotten. As the official data shows, face-to-face appointments have been available in every area of the country and in every month since the pandemic started. In only three months – April, May and June 2020, at the height of the first wave – were there more telephone appointments than face-to-face, and even then the figures were almost equal. On the most recent figures for March this year, there were nearly 16 million face-to-face appointments against 12.5 million appointments of other kinds.GPs deserve huge praise for maintaining their service under the greatest possible pressure. They can build on their excellent work in identifying patients in need of shielding. They likely deserve better than the letter from the NHS authorities that sparked this row, which gave the impression that GPs could not be trusted to make the right decisions on behalf of their patients. It is that unwarranted charge that has caused anger in the profession.That said, there is still certainly no need for the BMA to pass a “vote of no confidence” in NHS leaders, as the  reported today. The situation needs defusing, not throwing more fuel on the fire.When the dust settles, the important question is the style of GP service that the profession takes forward. The following principles may help.First, a recognition that all types of appointments are essential. Face-to-face appointments are needed in many situations, for example to enable GPs to become acquainted with new patients and spend time with those with serious conditions. Equally many patients will prefer telephone consultations.Online forms are an excellent way both to provide information to a surgery and to receive information when it is not time-critical. At the same time, according to recent studies, 10 per cent of the population do not have online access and 25 per cent are not fully comfortable online.  Practices need to provide a telephone service as well as offering online forms.This is why the BMA – the doctors’ representative organisation – is not helping. It is going to take time, hard work and tolerance to work out the right mix between face, telephone and digital. This is a new situation and certainly GPs need to consult with patients. That conversation is much better done locally.Second, general practice can evolve beyond the ten-minute GP consultation. Patients should expect to see practice staff, such as specialist nurses and physiotherapists. That will free up GPs to take longer consultations and get full value for their clinical expertise. In March, staff other than GPs took 45 per cent of all general practice appointments. That figure should rise in coming years.Third, changes at GP surgeries are far from the only way in which the NHS will change visibly in the next ten years. Patients will find themselves going to GP surgeries and other local centres for diagnostic scans rather than going to hospital. We will spend more much time talking to GPs and their staff about our lifestyles. While the Prime Minister speaks of 40 new hospitals, actually the focus will be on creating new local health centres in most English towns.It will be a new NHS offering easier access to services and at a sustainable cost. But it will be a real change, and it will need excellent, even-tempered communication from both Government and professions to provide reassurance to patients and the public.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"latest conflict israel palestine had one winner iran","story":"The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, boasts the Israeli Army has won its greatest victory. Hamas’s leader, Ismail Haniya, insists God has granted “defiant Gaza” victory. But who really won the war?Stepping back to look at the broader map of the Middle East, the worrying answer for the West is that it looks likely to be Iran. The ayatollahs’ local surrogates, Hamas, have survived the Israeli onslaught. In the process they have stress-tested the relationship between Israel and its most powerful ally. The cracks that have appeared between Netanyahu’s Israel and Biden’s America will have interested Tehran immensely. President Biden did not exactly abandon his country’s traditional allies. But his demand for an “unconditional ceasefire”, initially resisted by the Israelis, marked a sharp contrast with the usual rock solid support offered to Israel by Washington. US support for Israel’s security interests is shifting as the Biden team unravels the Trump foreign policy legacy. Nowhere was Trump more at odds with his predecessor and his predecessor’s vice-president than over the Middle East. Trump’s approach, of attempting to secure peace in the Middle East not by settling the question of Israel and Palestine but by uniting the region’s major powers around a shared distrust of Iran, led to remarkable results during his tenure. Now, however, the Obama-era orthodoxy has once again taken hold at the State Department. Aware that a “hardliner” is set to win the impending Iranian presidential election, “expert” opinion among Biden’s backers in Washington is that the President should hurry to reverse Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA before that happens. The thinking, which many would describe as hopelessly naive given past behaviour, is that this would “lock in” the Islamic Republic to its non-proliferation obligations. It is a good deal for Iran, with sanctions lifted and no restrictions on its research into the ancillary weapons systems necessary for an atomic weapon. What’s more, the restrictions even on enriching uranium, the final piece of the nuclear puzzle, are time-limited, too. Israel’s undeclared war on Iran’s nuclear programme is becoming a lonely one.Sensing Washington’s weakening stance on containing Iran, Saudi Arabia has opened “secret” talks with Tehran. This suggests that the Kingdom, having seen the treatment of Israel, is no longer confident of unequivocal US backing and is seeking to mend its fences with the Islamic Republic. This is a big step backwards from the rapprochement that took place between Israel and the Saudis under President Trump.That could mean Iran will rein in its Houthi allies in Yemen who have been firing missiles Hamas-style into Saudi Arabia, hitting its oil fields. Any ceasefire in Yemen, like in Gaza, will save civilian lives. The danger is that if Iran is the “peace-maker”, it can also be the “peace-breaker” when Tehran judges the moment right to resume conflict.The war between Israel and Gaza will have interested another Iranian proxy, too. Hizbollah in Lebanon did not feel the need to join in this time. But they will have been watching with interest how Israel’s Iron Dome worked against the Hamas rockets. Despite the Israeli Air Force’s repeated efforts to intercept weapons supplies to Hizbollah via Syria, Israel’s northern enemy has built up a much more formidable arsenal than Hamas had put together clandestinely in Gaza.US disengagement from the broader Middle East, including Afghanistan on Iran’s eastern flank, means the Islamic Republic is winning on points in the great game to decide the future of the region. Washington and the West pressured Israel to make peace but Iran will decide if it lasts. Mark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute, OxfordMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ufo uap aliens report sightings us government encounters barack","story":"She has also had one of the most famous close encounters with a UFO, or Unidentified Flying Object.In separate planes, Lt Cdr Dietrich and Commander David Fravor were dispatched to investigate.What they saw on that day has never been adequately explained – until now.Cmdr Fravor aggressively engaged one of the oblong objects, which he estimated to be 40ft in length, while Lt Cdr Dietrich adopted “high cover” above.Ship radar picked it up seconds later, 60 miles away. A third FA-18 then caught it on an infrared camera: it looked like a giant white Tic Tac.Lt Cdr Dietrich decided to go public with her story now – three years after Cdr Fravor – to reduce the “stigma” associated with UFO reports and, she says, to encourage other pilots to come forward without feeling “embarrassed or ashamed”.Her testimony coincides with a growing acceptance among defence officials around the world that there may indeed be something “out there” – and that it might pose a genuine global security threat.After decades of doing everything possible to keep reported sightings secret, there has been a sea change in how the Pentagon regards such sightings.For starters, it no longer refers to them as UFOs – with their connotations of little green men – but to UAPs, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. Next month, Congress is to be given an unclassified report on evidence collected by the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force, the Office of Naval Intelligence and the FBI.Ufologists - people who investigate UFOs - across the globe are hailing it as an unprecedented watershed moment in their long quest to uncover what the US government really knows – and they have former president Donald Trump to thank for it.“We’re absolutely in new territory here,” says Nick Pope, who investigated UFO sightings while working as a British civil servant for the Ministry of Defence in the 1990s.“What’s really elevated this is the sheer number, and position, of people now speaking out, saying we’re dealing with something that must be taken seriously, he added.“When top guns, who don’t impress easily, get excited about the capability of these objects, their speed, manoeuvrability, trans-medium travel in water and air… that gets my attention.The pilot testimony is important, but there is so much more: radar data, infrared, measurement and signature intelligence… and we’ll get to see some of it.”John Ratcliffe, director of National Intelligence under President Trump, raised anticipation when he hinted recently that there was “a lot” more information than the public currently knows.He said he had seen satellite imagery of objects “frankly engaging in actions that are difficult to explain”, and incidents of them breaking the sound barrier with no sonic boom.The following month, a farmer found wreckage on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. In a press release, the US military called it a “flying disc”, but later said it was part of a weather balloon.By the 1950s, the US Air Force was being inundated with UFO reports from the public. One of the most notorious was the so-called “Invasion of Washington” in 1952, when numerous sightings were made over the capital in a two-week period.It was the Cold War, and the CIA, fearing mass hysteria could play into the hands of the Soviet Union, worked to debunk sightings and infiltrate UFO-hunting groups.“Further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified,” it said.For decades afterwards, anyone who reported seeing something strange in the sky was considered a crackpot – even leading lights in the US military.However, there remained a few highly influential figures who believed a mystery was there to be solved. The most powerful among them was Senator Harry Reid, the Democrat leader in the US Senate from 2005 to 2017.In 2007, Mr Reid managed to push through Congress, clandestinely, $22 million in “black ops” funding for a new department. It was innocuously named the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP).From a fifth-floor office deep inside the Pentagon, a real-life X-Files team studied hundreds of reported UFO sightings – including the USS Nimitz “Tic Tac” incident from 2004.The department was led by Luis Elizondo, a career intelligence official who later resigned because he felt his findings were not being taken seriously enough.Shortly after his departure in late 2017, Mr Elizondo told the  how his team established geographical “hot spots” for sightings, sometimes near nuclear facilities, and common ways in which UFOs moved.“We began to see trends and similarities in incidents – very distinct observables. Extreme manoeuvrability, hypersonic velocity without a sonic boom, speeds of 8,000mph. A lot of this was supported by radar signal data, gun camera footage from aircraft, multiple witnesses.”He said he came to a “realisation that these are probably not any type of aircraft in any national inventory. I think it’s pretty clear it’s not us. So one has to ask the question where they’re from.”He also added: “There was never any display of hostility.”A key moment in the UFO debate – and whether it should be taken seriously – came in 2017 when the New York Times published the infrared video of the “Tic Tac” sighting. Ufologists felt vindicated, not least because it proved the Pentagon had seen fit to investigate the incident.Today, thanks to lockdown – which provided a dramatic reduction in light pollution coupled with an army of people with empty evenings on their hands – supposed UFO sightings have proliferated around the globe.In the UK alone, reports of suspected alien spacecraft doubled last year.And once-secret intelligence just keeps coming. Last month, footage of bizarre images of flashing pyramid-shaped UFOs was posted online, which the Pentagon confirmed was taken in 2019, by a US Navy ship off California.Another leaked video, taken from a fighter jet in 2015, showed a small object moving at tremendously high speed just above the water off Virginia on the US east coast. Pilots could be heard yelling: “Oh my gosh, dude” and “Wow! What is that, man? Look at that flying!”In another incident, pilots reported seeing an object that looked like a cube inside a sphere flying between their aircraft, which were barely 100ft apart.Many of these incidents are expected to be further detailed in next month’s report. But even though it will be “unclassified”, it\u0027s still unclear exactly how much will come out.“I don’t expect it’ll plunge into extraterrestrial visitation. If there is anything really juicy, it will probably be in the classified annex. Governments are just nervous and reluctant to say ‘We don’t know...’ because it makes them look weak and ineffective.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits wont wait long more","story":"NewsBrits wont have to wait long for more safe travel destinations, says Grant ShappsThe Transport Secretary said he was sure travel would bounce back when restrictions are relaxed - but Brits shouldnt expect a large expansion of the green list when its first updated in early JunemirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY NewsPortugal is already on the green list - but dont expect a lot of countries to join it in early June \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnson ’s former chief adviser came under fire for driving  miles from his London home just weeks into the strict first lockdown, when he was seen in Barnard Castle on April  last year.He has always denied ing north again the following week, but now there are calls for him to provide the evidence. He is due before the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Government’s handling of the pandemic. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  He is threatening to release a “crucial historical document” about the Prime Minister’s response, blaming Government secrecy for last year’s “catastrophe”. But his call for transparency could backfire as questions continue over the allegations of a second Durham trip, highlighted by a joint Mirror  investigation a year ago today. David and Clare Edwards, both , told police they saw Mr Cummings in Houghall Woods, Durham, just after am on April  last year.  He has consistently denied their version of events. Three other witnesses have since claimed they also saw him. In their response to a complaint by David and Clare over the handling of the case, Durham Police quoted a report that Mr Cummings was seen on Hampstead Heath in London on April . New Durham Police and Crime Commissioner Joy Allen has since said she would support examination of automatic number plate recognition footage near the woods for the time concerned.  David said: “I think it is a very good idea to ask Mr Cummings to provide evidence of where he was on April . Someone should ask him that question.” Former Durham Police chief constable Mike Barton said Mr Cummings had “risked lives” by driving across the country when his we was showing signs of infection.

Nicola Sturgeon today announced new travel restrictions linked to particularly serious outbreaks of the Indian iant in England. From Monday, travel restrictions will be imposed between Scotland the three local authority areas - Bedford, Bolton and Blackburn and Darwin. The First Minister said: If you are planning to visit these areas in the next few days please consider whether you need to make your visit or whether it can be delayed. She said it was hoped these rules would not be in place for very long, but added they were a further way of helping us reduce the risk that any more of this new iant comes into Scotland while we are trying to deal with outbreaks of it we have right now.Ms Sturgeon said it makes more sense to review coronavirus restrictions on a weekly basis, after announcing Glasgow will be the only area to remain in Level  of Scotlandaposs measures.Speaking at a Scottish Government coronavirus briefing on Friday, the First Minister said authorities are fairly certain the increase in cases in the city is being driven by the Indian iant - referred to by Ms Sturgeon as April- - with extensive public health measures deployed over the past  days.  The number of cases per , people in Glasgow has increased from  last week to . in the seven days to May . East Renfrewshire, which earlier this week had a higher seven-day average rate of cases than Glasgow, will remain in Level . Ms Sturgeon also said improvements in Moray mean it can join the rest of mainland Scotland in Level  on Saturday. Infection levels in Moray, in the north-east of Scotland, are down from  cases per , people last week to , with test positivity falling from .% to .%. In Level , people can hug and meet indoors - subject to restrictions - travel across the UK and overseas, and hospitality venues can open later than in Level  and serve alcohol indoors. Ms Sturgeon said the total number of cases in East Renfrewshire is signicantly smaller than in Glasgow, with only  on Thursday compared to  in the city, and could be traced to specic household clusters.  Asked whether Glasgow could face restrictions for a longer period because of the numbers, she said: The reason Iaposm not saying weaposll come back in three weeks now is I hope the overall duration of these higher level restrictions in Glasgow will be shorter than was the case earlier this year and at the tail end of last year. I think it actually makes more sense to review on a weekly basis, because we donapost want to keep Glasgow in higher level restrictions any longer than is necessary... because of the scale of the public health interventions that we have in deployment right now. And in determining where to put travel restrictions we just have to be mindful of peopleaposs travel patterns - people might live in the south side of Glasgow but in the city they donapost necessarily stay in the south side of Glasgow all the time because they work where and vice versa. Welcoming the changes in Moray, Chris Littlejohn, NHS Grampian deputy director of public health, said: I have no doubt this will be incredibly welcome news for the people of Moray. Bringing case numbers back down has been a community effort. Public bodies like the NHS and local councils can put in every measure we like, but without community support they will not make the same dference. Thank-you to everyone in the area for all that they have done. I hope the behaviour we have seen in Moray becomes a habit for people, not just there, but across the Grampian region. The death toll under this daily measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous  days - remains at ,. The daily test positivity rate was .%, up from .% the previous day. There were  people in hospital on Thursday with recently confirmed Covid-, down two from the previous day, and of these four people were in intensive care, down one from the day before.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNicola SturgeonBoris JohnsonNHSScottish GovernmentHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror bashir disgrace should","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Bashir disgrace should not tarnish BBC but it must never repeatThe BBC still strives to deliver impartial journalism and Martin Bashir’s personal ignominy should not be allowed to tarnish the whole of the corporation - which must ensure that such a situation can never happen againmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video prince-william-panorama-interview-holds-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:xCadRV,suggestedData:,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror video watch-skins-e-trailer--,articleUrl:https:www.mirror tv tv-news skins-cast-members-slam-show-,thumbnailUrl:https:cdn.jwplayer v media HniTtaT poster.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Bashir’s deceitful and unethical behaviour was an abuse of his position and a clear breach of the high journalistic standards on which his former employer prides itself. The BBC then added to the disgrace by failing to investigate properly the underhand tactics used to land the  interview. The whole sorry affair has caused understandable anguish for the late Princess’s family and friends. Earl Spencer has claimed there is a link between the programme and his sister’s death two years later.  The BBC has rightly apologised but its expressions of remorse will count for nothing unless it ensures that such a situation can never happen again. Bashir’s reputation rightly lies in tatters but his personal ignominy should not be allowed to tarnish the whole corporation, which still strives to deliver impartial journalism. Buck passers The Government has set aside £billion for the Covid test and trace system. Despite the eye-watering amount lavished, the programme is still not working properly.  We now learn that technical glitches were partly responsible for the spread of the Indian iant, with councils unable to respond to the outbreak because they could not access the data on positive tests in their area. Yet earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock implied it was the failure of people to get vaccinated that was behind the surge. This now comes across as an attempt to sht the blame for the Government’s own failings. Instead of trying to pass the buck, ministers should start taking some responsibility.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeBelle Hutt was studying for her GCSEs when she began struggling to stay awake in class. Despite getting a full night’s sleep, she was battling with an urge to close her eyes and snooze. “I had no idea what it was, so I’d just get up and go to the loo to wake up. Then I’d come back and be fine,” she told The Mirror. Over time, the bouts of exhaustion became more frequent, until eventually they were happening every day. Things came to a head when Belle was  and something strange happened in a biology exam. “In the middle of the exam I started to write a note out to my dad in perfect handwriting. I didn’t even realise I was doing it,” she explained.  “It was like I was dreaming before I’d even shut my eyes.” Later, Belle went home and told her worried mum, Debbie, what had happened. Meanwhile, she was still having daily sleep attacks and struggling to stay awake during the day. As her th birthday approached, Belle was getting ready to learn how to drive and had taken her theory test in anticipation. But Debbie was concerned. “My Mum wanted me to see a doctor before I got behind the wheel as she wasn’t comfortable with me driving,” Belle said. After seeing her GP, the teen was advised to go to bed earlier and stop looking at her phone late at night. “That didn’t seem right to me - I was already going to bed so early because I was exhausted,” she said.  In time, she was referred to a sleep specialist. After several tests, Belle was diagnosed with severe narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder. As the doctors explained the diagnosis, Debbie asked what could be done to cure the condition. “The doctors bluntly said: ‘There’s no cure. It’ll only get worse’,” Belle recalled. As her symptoms worsened, she noticed people making fun of her. “I was always the first to fall asleep at parties so people would draw on my face and do silly things like that. “After a while I stopped going to parties. I didn’t even worry about missing out because I was so exhausted.” In time, the bullying became so bad that Belle decided to leave school. By now, she was having sleep attacks between three and four times a day. Instead of allowing herself to nap, Belle fought the urge to fall asleep. But this brought on hallucinations and cataplexy. Cataplexy, commonly associated with narcolepsy, is a sudden loss of muscle strength triggered by an intense emotion such as laughter.  “It would only last for a few seconds, but sometimes I just wouldn’t be able to talk,” she explained. Perhaps the most frightening symptom Belle experienced was hallucinations when she was wide awake. “I’d be at home alone and I’d hear people open my front door, walk up the stairs and walk into my bedroom. I’d see them looking at me. It was so real,” she told The Mirror. “Because I was so scared, that would trigger cataplexy and I wouldn’t be able to move.” For three years, Belle battled to stay awake through the sleep attacks, trying to keep active instead. Belle said: “I started personal training when I was , I just had a few clients I’d see one-to-one from the gym in our garage. “I felt like I’d never be able to work for anyone  so this was my only option.” Around the same time, she met her now-fiancé, Maikel. After three years of dating, Belle moved to Amsterdam to live with him. “I thought I wouldn’t be able to work and needed someone to look after me,” she said. But eventually, a friend told her about People’s Place Gym in the city, which was looking for fitness class instructors. “I started working there and they were so good about everything. They’d let me take mats and blankets for naps during the dayI needed them.”  After leading a few classes at the gym, Belle realised something. “I felt such an incredible buzz and I was so awake. I realised I could lead three classes a day and fit in naps in between,” she explained.Things were going well until coronavirus raged around the globe and gyms across Europe shut their doors. Instead of sitting around waiting for them to reopen, Belle took matters into her own hands, and began leading live workouts on Instagram every morning.And it’s worked wonders for her narcolepsy symptoms. “I started doing % more exercise than I was before, leading workouts every day,” she said. “Since becoming fitter and stronger, I’ve not suffered from cataplexy for about a year. It’s given me so much more control over my day.” She now runs the @BelleHuttLiveCommunity on Instagram, leading live workouts every day for more than  people who attend her classes.  She also uses her personal account @BelleHutt, which has more than , followers, to dispel common myths about narcolepsy. “People think I just need more sleep than anyone , but actually I find it hard to sleep through the night,” she told the Mirror. “I take medication at night now which helps me sleep for longer, but before that I was getting two hours of broken sleep a night.” She described narcolepsy as having a disrupted body clock, so the body gets confused about when it needs to sleep. Using her  to explain the condition, she also wants to tackle parody depictions of the sleep disorder. “I’ve seen comedy characters who have narcolepsy as people who just fall over and sleep in the middle of the day, and that’s really not what it is,” she explained. After discovering the wonders of regular exercise, Belle wants to inspire people to move their bodies for their own mental wellbeing. “So many people label exercise as for fat loss, but I want people to realise it’s great for your mental health. “You don’t have to be at the gym, or even wearing trainers. You can be dancing around the living room in jeansyou want, but it feels so great to move your body.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPersonal trainerBullyingFitness"},{"url":null,"title":"abbas waterloo voted best eurovision","story":"NewsAbbas Waterloo voted best Eurovision song by Brits who want Adele to compete for UKA study of , Brits found the Swedes legendary hit was most popular but the top  is dominated with UK hits - while four in  adults would like the whole contest rebranded to The Worldvision Song ContestmirrorShareCommentsByEmma Elsworthy:,  MAY NewsAbbas hits are timeless \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

How can I stay safe  Go at your own pace and follow the rules. It’s safer to meet outsideyou can – and minimise close contact.

The victim, , was cycling in West Chiltington, West Sussex with his father when he was struck from behind by a Renault Twingo. Keith Vernon, , was at the wheel of the vehicle - which knocked the youngster over his handlebars and into the road. The motorist then continued to drive over the boy, police say, despite the desperate warnings of horried onlookers. Vernon ignored the pleas of the members of the public and reversed over the boy, seriously injuring him and destroying his helmet.Have you been affected by this incident  Email webnews@mirror. He then fled the scene with the bike still trapped beneath his car, it was said. Shocking pictures show the mangled remains of the car, the helmet and the bike. Emergency services raced to the incident, which occurred about .pm on October , and the boy was taken to hospital. He suffered a broken collar bone, a fractured vertebrae, a fractured pelvis, a dislocated hip and a burn covering the left side of his face. Sussex Police say he is now recovering. The force attended the address of the registered owner of the Twingo, which was discovered unattended and having mounted a kerb, with the victim’s bike still trapped beneath. Retired Vernon, of West Chiltington, was then breathalysed and found to have mcg of alcohol per ml of breath in his system. The legal limit is mcg.  He was subsequently arrested and charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, drink-driving and failing to stop after a road traffic collision. He pleaded guilty to the offences at Worthing magistrates’ court on February  and before appearing for sentencing at Hove crown court on May . There he was jailed for two-and-a-half years’ imprisonment and was disqualied from driving for four-and-a-half years. His sentence was reduced for his early guilty plea. Her Honour Judge Barnes said Vernon deliberately made a conscious decision to drive when drunk. She did not accept that he had not seen the cyclists, and added that he had a desire to protect himself before anyone .

The judge said she did not accept that Vernon did not know the child was under his car She also commented how any father could put himself over a child was beyond belief. She added that Vernon made the decision to go home, despite stating he was traumatised, and made no attempt to call  orto the scene. The judge also said there is no blame whatsoever to be put on the cyclists. Sergeant Richard Hornsey, formerly of the Serious Collision Investigations Unit, said: Vernon was driving home after drinking in a local pub and was over the drink-drive limit when he collided with the cyclist. This was clearly a traumatic incident for those directly involved, but it has also affected the wider community. Vernon ignored the pleas of the bystanders, which included the child’s father, and they described the wheels of the car spinning as Vernon tried to drive away while the child and the bicycle were trapped underneath. The child was wearing a cycle helmet which received signicant damage but protected him from a more serious head injury. Vernon drove for over a quarter of a mile through the village with the bicycle trapped under his car, but at no point did he stop to checkthe cyclist was still underneath, which shows a complete disregard for the safety of other road users.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"eight neighbours share 240000 lottery","story":"AdvertorialEIGHT neighbours share £, Lottery win - and reveal epic idea to celebrateThe lucky lot each won £, playing Peoples Postcode LotterymirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Advertorialthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video christina-new-tredegar-street-wins-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:EsKidV,suggestedData:,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror video watch-skins-e-trailer--,articleUrl:https:www.mirror tv tv-news skins-cast-members-slam-show-,thumbnailUrl:https:cdn.jwplayer v media HniTtaT poster.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car. What a lovely surprise, I can finish off what I want to do with the house without having to save. “Maybe a holiday next year. Our holiday to Fuerteventura was cancelled this year, but we might go further afield now.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to all the winners. He said: “What a fantastic surprise for our winners in New Tredegar! I can tell it is a really close community, so I was thrilled to bring this great news. “Congratulations to them and all our other winners today, I’m sure they’ll enjoy their winnings.” Everyday throughout the April draws one postcode was announced as a £, prize winner. All the players in the postcode won £, for every ticket they hold. People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day.

According to water firm United Utilities, the disgusting mass of waste, wet wipes and other sanitary items discovered in Liverpool had to be removed as it was causing homes to flood. So the firmaposs engineers came up with an ingenious method which essentially eats the fatberg from the inside out. The strategy saw workers push a steel rope through the m fatberg and cut it with a jet. Programme delivery manager Sammy Nelson said: It was done with great success and within a couple of weeks, flow was restored to the sewer.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments section below. The fatberg, which had been causing issues on Bankhall Lane, Birchall Street and Foster Street, was removed in half the time it would have taken to replace the sewer. It is one of a string of vile masses discovered across the country this year. In February the Mirror reported how gruesome pictures of fatbergs and other drain blockages in Hull prompted a warning about responsible flushing.The images, shared by the team of workers tasked with clearing the horric waste, showed the dramatic consequences of wet wipes, sanitary products and cotton buds being flushed down toilets, as well as fats, oils and greases being poured down drains.  That came just before a huge, disgusting fatberg the weight of a small bungalow was removed from a sewer in London. Members of the public had at the time been urged to be careful what they flush following the two-week removal operation for the foul-smelling mass from a conduit in Canary Wharf, London.While  tonnes of unflushable waste, equivalent to two massive blue whales, were cleared from  miles of sewer pipes underneath Southend-on-Sea in Essex last month.

James Spark and Mark Didlick uncovered the bust of emperor Marcus Aurelius last year alongside a statuette of the god of Mars on horseback, a horse-head kne handle and a large bronze pendulum. The immaculately preserved items were buried in a field in Ryedale, North Yorks, as an offering to the gods as part of a Roman religious ceremony in about AD. The finely-modelled bust of the Roman ruler Marcus Aurelius, who ruled from -AD, depicts him with hair and beard flamboyantly curled. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  It would have been attached to the end of a sceptre which probably belonged to a senior military commander about , years ago. Found alongside it was the toy-like god of Mars on horseback, the decorative end of a kne and a plumb-bob- a weight that acted like a spirit-level used by the Romans in construction. The antiquities were found over a one square metre area in a field. It was initially thought the four objects might be worth about £, in total.  But the auction house that sold them increased their estimate to £, after receiving worldwide interest ahead of the sale. The objects sold for a hammer price of £, with Hansons Auctioneers, of Etwall, Derbys, following a bidding war. The winning bidder, a London buyer who was in the room, paid £, including fees. On the rostrum, auctioneer Charles Hanson said: “It was an extraordinary result for an extraordinary lot.  “It was an honour to auction these fascinating historical items - antiquities which had not seen been for , years. “This was a lot like no other. It provided a tantalising insight into Roman le centuries ago.” Adam Staples, Hansons historica expert, said: “I’m thrilled for the finders and landowner who watched the auction. “It was a fantastic result.”  He added: “The hoard of artefacts was probably buried as a religious offering which marked the closure of a rural shrine or the death of a priest. “The artefacts would have formed a suite of ritual implements, to be utilised when performing religious ceremonies and for predicting the future. “Heis indeed very lucky not to have been broken by his , years spent underground.  “The bust has survived extremely well and is in very fine condition with a glossy green patina. “This is a nationally important group of artefacts.” Mr Spark, , from York, previously described the moment he and Mr Didlick found the hoard.

Sarah Clarke, , is the ex of two men serving le for murder - her eight-year-old sonaposs dad and stepdad.Her childaposs father, Damian aposScarfaceapos Gorman, was jailed for a pub assassination with notorious cop killer Dale Cregan, the Liverpool Echo reports.Her sonaposs stepdad, Stephen Strutt, was one of four killers who murdered dad-of-one Warren Glover. Clarke told police deliberate lies about his whereabouts, later hiding him in a Blackpool hotel room, booked using her auntaposs bank card. Clarke sobbed as her lawyer today made a plea for mercy at Liverpool Crown Court. He said this was for her son, for whom she is the sole carer.  But Judge Denis Watson, QC, said her case was yet another example of how a criminalaposs actions impact on not only the lives of their victims, but their own family as well.CCTV footage showed Strutt, , stopping to buy beer when he travelled from Manchester to Merseyside with a gang to hunt down Mr Glover on Saturday, June  last year.Judge Watson said the victim was killed out of vengeance, after sending offensive and provocative texts to his ex-girlfriend Melissa Stubbs, , her parents and friends.The NHS worker was attacked by Melissaaposs brother Aaron Stubbs, , in residential French Street, at around .pm.Aaron and Melissa earlier threatened they were coming to smack his head in and their mum Gail Duff had texted the victim: Prepare to meet your maker. Mr Glover came out with a lump hammer and damaged the Stubbsapos car, before running away, but Aaron struck him over the head from behind with an iron bar.  Strutt had recruited his brother-in-law, Peter Walker, , to join the attack, who chased Mr Glover with a baseball bat. Mr Glover was found unconscious in the street and died in hospital on July .Aaron, Melissa, Strutt and Walker were all found guilty of murder after a trial, when Clarke was convicted of assisting an offender.Strutt, who had a child of his own, lived with Clarke in Stalybridge, but she claimed she had no idea he was wanted for murder. Judge Watson said when Struttaposs family home was searched by police on July , Clarke texted her sister details from the search documents. On July , she sent a text to Strutt saying donapost get caught with him, which Judge Watson said was a reference to Aaron Stubbs, then still at large.  He told Clarke from at least July  and likely earlier, you knew perfectly well that the police were wanting to speak to your partner and from that date onwards at the very latest you knew he was wanted for questioning in relation to a murder investigation. The judge said she searched online about who was going to be charged and knew from seeing Struttaposs photo that he was wanted, but all the while you provided shelter and advice for him. Judge Watson told her that was serious enough, but you then actively misled the police to his whereabouts, telling them that he not been seen by you for several days and that he was working away. The judge, who branded these deliberate lies, said the next day the couple travelled to Garstang, where she persuaded relatives to let her use their bank cards to book a hotel in a dferent name in Blackpool. The court heard they stayed overnight there, but police by then had tracked down and arrested Strutt. Andy Scott, defending, said character references from family and friends spoke in the most positive and glowing terms of Ms Clarke, her qualities as a mother and as a friend.  He said: Sarah Clarke of course is anxious over her fate. However, she acknowledges that her anxiety, her distress, is nothing compared with the grief and trauma of the family and friends of Warren Glover. Pleading for mercy, he said she had a realistic prospect of rehabilitation, strong personal mitigation and jailing her would have a signicant harmful impact on her child. He said Clarke was considered a low risk of reconviction and a medium risk of causing danger to the public, and her only past conviction was for motoring offences last year. Mr Scott suggested her crime didnapost extensively impede justice and when hiding Strutt in Blackpool, it was inevitable she would have ed home, because of her son. Judge Watson interjected: She might have done. Mr Scott said Strutt was arrested within hours of them going to the hotel and asked the judge to balance that with texts she sent him asking himself to hand himself in. Clarke cried in the dock as Mr Scott added: She is of course a sole carer for her son, Of course we know that Mr Strutt was the stepfather. He had been taken away. Ms Clarke has ended that relationship with Mr Strutt.  He said Clarke feared her relationship with her son would be irreparably damaged and the rupture to it enormous, adding thatshe was jailed, it would be devastating. Mr Scott said: She will lose her liberty. She will also lose her home. He said the eight-year-old boy had dficulties of his own, outlined at a recent Child in Need meeting, but he would not delve into further personal matters in a report. Mr Scott said: To say Ms Clarke has been unlucky in love is an understatement. Once again, ultimately she will have to pick up the fragments of a fractured relationship. She takes the blame heavily on her own shoulders. That again primarily is because of the harm and the hurt she will have caused her son. The judge said he had bore the impact on her son in mind, but her crime was a real, albeit short lived impediment to an arrest police had tried to make for weeks. Judge Watson, who said the signicant mitigation had resulted in a shorter sentence, jailed Clarke for  months. One of Clarkeaposs supporters - a man sitting in the public gallery - stood up and shouted you will be alright as she was sent down, while a sobbing woman rushed towards the dock and said: Can we see her  Judge Watson said: You wonapost be able to see her - thank you very much for coming. The man moaned smug face on him as he stormed out of court. Jailing Strutt for le with a minimum of  years, Judge Watson previously said: You knew you were wanted by the police and you were trying to lie low in Blackpool to avoid arrest. Aaron Stubbs, of Lane End Road, Burnage, was jailed for le with a minimum of  and a half years. Melissa Stubbs, of the same address as her brother, was jailed for le with a minimum of  and a half years. Walker, of Garth Road, Wythenshawe, was jailed for le with a minimum of  and a half years. Clarkeaposs ex-boyfriend Gorman was convicted of the murder of gangland rival Mark Short, and the attempted murder of three other men, at an east Manchester pub. Clarkeaposs relationship with Gorman led to her facing a charge of intimidating a witness and giving evidence at his and Creganaposs murder trial in . Preston Crown Court heard Clarke and Gorman lived together for three years and she had his son in September . The then -year-old told the trial she had been charged with intimidating a female witness, who had given evidence against Gorman, then . She denied intimidating the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in a park following the midnight shooting of Mark Short in May . That witness described how intimidating cocaine dealer Gorman, who she said was known as Scarface, had threatened her thatshe went to the police, the one-eyed Scotchman - Cregan - would kill her. The prosecution alleged the two assassins Cregan and Gorman went to clean up at Clarkeaposs home after killing Mark Short and pointed to Gormanaposs clothing, found outside the property in bin bags, as evidence of this. However, Clarke told jurors she had dumped Gormanaposs clothes outside the house they rented in Hollingworth, Tameside, when she moved out because Gorman had been jailed for  weeks over a previous matter. Cregan, who admitted murdering both Mark Short and his dad David Short during the trial, having earlier admitted murdering police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, was handed a whole le sentence.

The new test by testing service HALO costs £ and lets you swab your mouth instead of your nose. This means Brits wouldnapost have to go through the procedure of having a swab in the back of the throat and the nostril. It is the first saliva-based PCR test to reportedly be given approval for holidaymakers.HALO Founder Jonathan Biles told the Sun: “With our new Day  and  test service, we will provide British travellers with a painless, safe, reliable and cost-effective way to approach travel.“Our new Day  and  testing service will continue our relentless focus on quality.  With a test success rate of over  per cent, our own first-class lab at Imperial College London and a UK based customer support team operating  hours a day seven days a week, we pride ourselves on offering the most complete, best-value testing service available. The Department of Health and Social Care did not comment when contacted by The Mirror. This comes as results of a University of Oxford trial show a comprehensive testing system is key to resuming international travel. The experiment, which involved data from almost  travellers on flights from the US to Heathrow, also showed passengers would be happy to pay for their own tests.  Researchers at the Oxford Internet Instituteused flights operated by British Airways and American Airlines for the trial, which took place between November  and March . Travellers took a PCR test  hours before departure, a LAMP test upon arrival at Heathrow - a type which s results more quickly than the PCR - and a third PCR taken three to five days after ing. According to the researchers, just one per cent of travellers who took the first PCR tested positive and so did not travel, and none of those who touched down in the US tested positive, suggesting the first test was effective. Of the travellers who took the third test after arriving in the UK, .% of travellers tested positive. In a joint statement on the findings, American Airlines, British Airways and oneworld said: The trial findings underline the important role that testing can play in the safe reopening of international travel, including hugely signicant routes between the US and UK.  The airlines said they would be ready to partner with governments to offer affordable testing options, adding the study further reinforces that customers are willing to undergo testing as an alternative to quarantine. Some .% of travellers said they were happy to adhere to testing requirements as an alternative to quarantine after international travel and % were prepared to pay for affordable testing. The majority were prepared to pay £ or less for each test, and % said they would pay more than £. Findings of the Oxford study will be shared with governments and stakeholders. Professor Philip Howard, professor of internet studies at the OII, said: As many countries make progress on vaccinating their citizens the debate over reopening travel safely is becoming increasingly important.

The animal group which led the original pet killing investigation - SNARL - is looking into the slaying which they believe is linked to the Croydon Cat Killer. Katherine, a student beautician from Catford, Lewisham, said: Iaposd be able to managehe had died in a normal way, but this is really disturbing. Tonysaid the head and tail are usually brought back a week or so later. Iaposm constantly looking for them. I canapost put him to rest until Iaposve found all his body. I donapost think Iaposll ever come to terms with this.  Please keep your cats in at night and be extra vigilant - especially at the moment when there is a killer around. I would hate for anybody  to go through the same pain. This killer has to be found. politan Police spent over £, and , hours during their investigation into the cat deaths, but in  they ruled the serial cat killer did not exist and the mutilations were caused by foxes. No evidence of human involvement was found in any of the reported cases and there was no CCTV footage, identiable patterns, forensic leads or witnesses. CCTV footage that was recovered showed foxes carrying bodies or body parts of cats.  Tony Jenkins, founder of South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty, collected the pet, and then contacted Katherine as he had heard about her search for Theo. The heartbroken cat owner identied her cat from photos, due to his distinctive markings. The woman then called the police and said they were kind to her, but could not look into Theoaposs death due to a lack of CCTV and because the investigation had closed. She said: When Tony called back my heart just sank. Tony said the way Theo was killed and the fact that his head and tale were missing linked Theo to the Croydon Cat Killer.  It is so clearly not a road traffic accident or foxes. Foxes would not take the heads and bring them back. There would be more blood, claw marks or teeth marks. If a cat was hit by a car you would see dirt and broken bones. Tony is sure that cats are mutilated with knives. There arenapost foxes walking around with knives - I hope not anyway. I suffer with anxiety and depression. Theo really helped me get away from my worries and fears. I canapost look at photos of him and I keep waiting for him to come home. Itaposs just so horrible. Itaposs known that murderers have started off by hurting animals, and move to humans when thataposs no longer gratying. Itaposs only a matter of time.  Tony,  from Croydon, London, is a retired project coordinator and is now a full-time animal rescuer and investigator. He said: The conclusion of the investigation doesnapost explain why these are predominantly happening in the southeast of England but we have cars and foxes over the whole of the UK. There was no decrease in these killings in lockdown when there were less cars on the road. The investigation only did  post-mortems because they are expensive. They closed it after finding fox DNA on five bodies, and puncture marks on five, and because CCTV footage showed a fox carrying a cat. Yes foxes do scavenge dead cats, but they would take the body because they would most likely need to feed a family. Vets that examined bodies concluded the cuts were made with a kne and by the same person.  Tony said he usually posts a description on the SNARL Facebook page whenever a mutilated cat is found and owners of pets contact him.Because most of the dead and mutilated cats are microchipped, it is easy to match them with owners, he said. Otherwise, he uses details such as markings on their bodies to identy the cats from ownersapos photographs. Some people say these are just cats, Tony added, but for the owners itaposs as devastating as losing a member of the family. Previous reports from cat owners and press suggest these killings have been going on for around  years. An earlier investigation in  was closed down in . The apparent slaying of Katherineaposs Theo comes after MP for Carshalton and Wallington, Elliot Colburn, called for the Met to reopen its investigation.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticePrince Harry has revealed he suffered panic attacks and descended into binge drinking and drugs while battling feelings of being unable to save his mother. The Duke of Sussex opened up in his new Apple TV+ show about the trauma he suffered following Princess Diana’s death in a car crash in . But while speaking to Oprah Winfrey, he launched yet another broadside at his family, revealing he was “worried and afraid” toto the UK for Prince Philip ’s funeral. Speaking to the US chat show queen in the five-part series The Me You Can’t See, the Prince, , also told how we Meghan urged him seek help more than four years ago following a fight where he reverted to a “-year-old”. The series shows him having therapy such as EMDR treatment, an interactive psychotherapy technique used to relieve trauma and PTSD.  Harry tells how he first tried to seek help for his mental health in his s after years of pain before finally committing to therapy when he met Meghan, now , five years ago. The Duke said of emotional turmoil in his childhood and s: “I wasn’t in an environment where it was encouraged to talk about it either, that was sort of, like, squashed.” The series is another chapter in the unprecedented openness Harry is bringing to his le since stepping away from his royal duties and moving to Calornia with pregnant Meghan and their son Archie, two. Since March, he and Meghan have accused the Royal Family of racism and cutting them off financially.  Astonishingly, while on the series, Harry claimed he and Meghan believed their explosive interview with Winfrey would actually help reconcile them with the royals. However, their accusations have reportedly driven a deep wedge between the Duke and his brother, Prince William. Harry described the bombshell discussion as “real and authentic”. He said: “I like to think that we were able to speak truths in the most compassionate way possible, therefore leaving an opening for reconciliation and healing.” He added of Meghan: “Before the Oprah interview had aired, because of the combined efforts of The Firm and the media to smear her, I was woken up in the middle of the night to her crying into her pillow because she doesn’t want to wake me up because I’m already carrying too much. That’s heartbreaking.” On Diana  Harry again hinted racism played a part in his le saying his mother was “chased to death while in a relationship with someone who wasn’t white”. He added he feared “history repeating itself” with we Meghan. The Princess of Wales died in  alongside Egyptian film producer Dodi Al-Fayed, who she had been dating for several months. “My mother was chased to her death while she was in a relationship with someone who wasn’t white,” he said. “And now look what’s happened. “You want to talk about history repeating itself. They’re not going to stop until she dies. “It’s incredibly triggering to potentially lose another woman in my le. Like, the list is growing.”  Talking about his struggles, Harry said he was still “haunted” by the sound of horses hooves down The Mall at his mother’s funeral. He said he was “outside of his body” while following the coffin. “When my mum was taken away from me at the age of , just before my th birthday, I didn’t want the [royal] le. Sharing the grief of my mother’s death with the world,” he revealed. Harry said he believes his late mother ‘helped him get where he is today and that he’s “never felt her presence more” than he has over the last year living in Calornia with his family. He added: “I’m living the le that she wanted to live for herself. Living the le that she wanted us to be able to live.” On drink and drug abuse  The Prince opened about his past use of drink and drugs, saying the trauma of his mother’s death left him seeking a release. He said he used them both to “mask” his hurt to “feel less like I was feeling”. The father of one, who is expecting his second child - a daughter - later this summer, told Winfrey he would consume a week’s worth of alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night “not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something”. In the first episode, he tells the American chat-show host about the years following the death of his mother. Harry said: “I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling. “But I slowly became aware that, okay I wasn’t drinking Monday to Friday, but I would probably drink a week’s worth in one day on a Friday or a Saturday night.”  He said he found his brain was “telling [him] that I’m in a fight”. Harry described the ages “ to ” as a “nightmare”. The Prince said: “Every time I put a suit on and tie on ... having to do the role, and go, ‘right, game face, look in the mirror and say, “let’s go”. Before I even left the house, I was pouring with sweat. I was in fight or flight mode. “From freaking out every single time I jumped in the car and every single time I see a camera - I would just start sweating. “I would feel as though my body temperature was two or three degrees warmer than everybody  in the room. I would convince myself that my face was bright red and therefore, everybody could see how I was feeling, but no one would know why, so that was embarrassing.” Attack on royal family  The Duke of Sussex detonated a “truth bomb” on his own family, accusing them of “total silence” and “neglect” when Meghan was suicidal. He claimed his father, Prince Charles, made him “suffer” as a child insisting he would no longer be “bullied into silence” when he alleged royal le “trapped” and then dumped them. “Certainly now I will never be bullied into silence,” he told Winfrey. “I thought my family would help, but every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, just got met with total silence, total neglect. “We spent four years trying to make it work. We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job. But Meghan was struggling.” He went on: “That feeling of being trapped within the family, there was no option to leave. “Eventually, when I made that decision for my family, I was still told, ‘You can’t do this’. And it’s like, ‘Well how bad does it have to get until I am allowed to do this ’. “She [Meghan] was going to end her le. It shouldn’t have to get to that.” On royal le  Harry is seen to complain about his royal le during the series, saying it was becoming his family’s “yes man” that led to him suffering severe fatigue. During the series second episode, he said he was “forced” into trips singling out his visit to Nepal in  and became his le became “really hectic but to the point of exhaustion”. The Duke said: “Towards my late s, everything became really hectic for me, but to the point of exhaustion. “I was travelling all over the place because, you know, from the family’s perspective, I guess I was the person who [was] like ‘we need someone to go there. Nepal, Harry you go’.  “I was always the yes man I was always the one willing to say yes. But that yes and yes and yes, of course, yes yes yes led to burnout. “And it was like someone had taken the lid off. All of the emotions that I had suppressed for so many years suddenly came to the forefront.” He then described how his burnout led to him seeing medical help and that only on meeting Meghan did it save him. He said: “I saw GPs, I saw doctors, I saw therapists, I saw alternative therapists, I saw all sorts of people. “But it was meeting and being with Meghan - I knew thatI didn’t do therapy and fix myself, that I was going to lose this woman who I could see spending the rest of my le with.” On his row with Meghan  Harry told Winfrey how a row with then-girlfriend Meghan Markle was what led to the therapy he needed. After an explosive row, he said she turned to him and said: “I think you need to see someone.” He told how it “was in reaction to an argument that we had. And in that argument, not knowing about it, I reverted back to -year-old Harry.” Before getting the help he needed, the Prince said he would try to push the trauma from his mother’s death to one side. “I don’t want to think about her becauseI think about her, then it’s going to bring up the fact that I can’t bring her back, and it’s just going to make me sad,’ he said. “What’s the point in thinking about something sad  What’s the point of thinking about someone that you’ve lost and you’re never going to get back again  And I just decided not to talk about it.” Meghanaposs suicidal thoughts  In one of the most painful revelations, Harry delved further into his we’s mental state over the team she contemplated suicide. He said Meghan was only prevented from killing herself by concern over him “losing another woman in my le”. Barely a year into their marriage and while pregnant with their son Archie she began suffering deep depression. Expanding on the Duchess’s interview own interview with Winfrey in March, Harry opened up about his we’s struggle. “The thing that stopped her [Meghan] from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that had happened to my mum and to now to be put in a position of losing another woman in my le - with a baby inside of her,our baby,” he said. “The scariest thing for her was her clarity of thought. She hadn’t ‘lost it.’ She wasn’t crazy. She wasn’t self-medicating, be it through pills or through alcohol. She was absolutely sober. “She was completely sane. Yet in the quiet of the night, these thoughts woke her up.” Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family.

Harry admitted he did not know how to handle her confession. “I’m somewhat ashamed of the way that I dealt with them,” he added. “And of course, because of the system that we were in and the responsibilities and the duties that we had, we had a quick cuddle and then we had to get changed to jump in a convoy with a police escort and drive to the Royal Albert Hall for a charity event. Then step out into a wall of cameras and pretend as though everything’s okay. “There wasn’t an option to say, ‘you know what, tonight, we’re not going to go’ because just imagine the stories that come from that.” Harry said the couple’s appearance at the event was a turning point for him, realising they could not continue the way they were. He said: “While my we and I were in those chairs, gripping each other’s hand, the moment the lights go down, Meghan starts crying. I’m feeling sorry for her, but I’m also really angry with myself that we’re stuck in this situation.” On Prince Phillipaposs funeral  The Duke said ing to London to attend his grandfather’s Prince Philip’s funeral last month meant he suffered again. Harry said it again put him in a place where he felt trapped and constantly watched by cameras. He said: “I was worried about it, I was afraid.” Harry said he was able to work through any anxiety using coping skills learned in therapy. “It definitely made it a lot easier, but the heart still pounds,” he said.  Harry allowed cameras to film him undergoing an “extraordinary” therapy session, during which he received treatment for anxiety attacks he said are triggered every time he flies into Britain. He was filmed closing his eyes and tapping his chest during “eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing” . He said the treatment was a way to cope with the trauma of feeling “hunted” while on UK soil. The Duke said he has “always felt worried” when he flies back to London but only became aware of this after doing therapy. On Archie  The father- of one discussed his heartache his son Archie, two, will never meet his late mother, Princess Diana, claiming her name was among the youngster’s first words. While appearing on ‘The Me You Can’t See’, the Duke said: “I got a photo of her in his nursery, and it was one of the first words that he said apart from ‘mama’, ‘papa’, it was then grandma. Grandma Diana. “It’s the sweetest thing, but at the same time, it makes me really sad because she should be here.” The Prince wears a dog tag with the initial ‘A’ around his neck.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince HarryPrincess DianaPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesApple TVRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"queen prince charles dismayed harrys","story":"NewsQueen and Prince Charles will be dismayed at Harrys claims, royal expert saysAuthor Phil Dampier said Prince Charles and Prince William will be tearing out whats left of their hair as the Duke of Sussex opens up about his mental health in a new documentarymirrorShareCommentsByChiara Fiorillo:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPrince Harry has opened up about his mental health \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

During the first three episodes of Apple TVaposs The Me You Canapost See, Harry also told Winfrey about his substance abuse following his mumaposs death. Harry told Winfrey: I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling. The duke would drink a weekaposs worth of alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something.  As a -year-old he was involved in under-age drinking and taking cannabis, with his dad sending him to visit a rehabilitation clinic in south-east London, to highlight the long-term dangers of drug use. The Duke also told Winfrey his family did not speak about Dianaaposs death and expected him to just deal with the resulting press attention and mental distress. He said that after marrying Meghan his attempts to get help from his family, following online trolling which was pushing her to the brink, were ignored. He said: Every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, to stop just got met with total silence or total neglect. Harry added: We spent four years trying to make it work. We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job. The now -year-old said his family told him to play the game and le would improve. But he objected, telling Winfrey: Iaposve got a hell of a lot of my mum in me. The only way to free yourself and break out is to tell the truth. Harry told Winfrey he would never be bullied into silence in the future.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarklePrince HarryOprah WinfreyPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesDocumentariesRoyal FamilyMental health"},{"url":null,"title":"teen left partially blind after","story":"NewsTeen left partially blind after phone charger explodes and spark flies into her eyeBirmingham University Law student Esther Modede, , was left partially blind in her left eye after a damaged phone charger exploded and sparks damaged her eyemirrorShareCommentsByAlyce Collins:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video teen-left-blinded-after-phone-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:vTYAxfD,suggestedData:,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror video watch-skins-e-trailer--,articleUrl:https:www.mirror tv tv-news skins-cast-members-slam-show-,thumbnailUrl:https:cdn.jwplayer v media HniTtaT poster.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Law student Esther Modede, , from Birmingham, West Midlands, was plugging her phone in on the evening of April  when she noticed the wire looked a little damaged. Shortly after, Esther’s phone and the charger started burning up and she noticed smoke. Moments later the wire began exploding and one of the sparks hit Esther directly in the eye, leaving her unable to see out of her left eye. That night Esther spent four hours in hospital getting a bandage over her eye, which she had to keep on for three days. When the bandage was removed, Esther’s eyesight still wasn’t back to normal but she is slowly recovering.  Esther said: “I had borrowed my friends my charger over the weekend and when I got it back it was slightly damaged. “I didn’t think anything of it so I plugged in my phone to charge and it started burning up. “I didn’t think it was going to get any worse and then as I was recording it, it started sparking.  “I then got a spark in my eye and I couldn’t see very well at all. I didn’t realise I was that close or that the spark would be able to enter my eye. I was extremely worried. “Everything went blurry and when I closed my other eye I couldn’t see very well. “I had the bandage on my eye for three days. When I took the bandage off I couldn’t see very clearly, but my sight has cleared up and is still healing.” Esther was told by eye specialists at Birmingham City Hospital that the spark had damaged her cornea. She added: The surface of my eye was effected. The moment the spark hit my eye my eye shut and I felt it begin to swell. It was a hot sensation. The swelling and the blurring of my sight was worrying. My vision as of last week was still recovering but as of [now], currently, it’s a lot better and I can now read when the other eye is shut.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnEducationHospitalsStudents"},{"url":null,"title":"terrified boy asks are going","story":"NewsTerried boy asks are we going to die mummy  as  yobs set cars on fire at vigilA vigil held for Ethan Powell, who collapsed and died on Tuesday evening aged just , turned into a riot with cars torched and motors sent freewheeling down a hillmirrorShareCommentsByAdam AspinallNews reporterMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video swansea-riots-chaos-vigil-turns-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:Rylfndrl,suggestedData:,,,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror video watch-skins-e-trailer--,articleUrl:https:www.mirror tv tv-news skins-cast-members-slam-show-,thumbnailUrl:https:cdn.jwplayer v media HniTtaT poster.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The vigil was being held for Ethan Powell, who collapsed and died on Tuesday evening aged just . After a balloon release on Thursday, thugs ran amok torching cars and throwing bricks through windows. Ethan’s cousin Tegan Davies said the first part of the vigil was “brilliant”. But she said of the violence that erupted in the Mayhill area of Swansea: “This has gone way out of hand! “I know Ethan loved an argument with the police but this has gone next level, kids and people living by are absolutely petried.  The videos I’ve been sent are disgusting, I know Ethan would never have taken it this far. “Bikes and balloons we said, not a f***ing riot!” One mum who asked not to be named said the terrying riot had left her children deeply scared.“It was terrying, she told The Sun. My six-year-old boy asked mewe were all going to die. My -year-old daughter says she never wants to spend another night here.  A brick was thrown through her window and a car was torched outside her home. One video of the mayhem shows yobs sending a car freewheeling down a road. Other rioters set cars on fire. Ethan collapsed hours after watching Swansea City’s playoff game against Barnsley on television with his grandad. His cause of death has yet to be confirmed. Local Sylvie Bennett said: “I am shocked at the disrespect shown to Ethan Powell. “He wouldn’t want this and neither do his family want this. So know that Swansea is not proud of you as you are all a disgrace.  “You have not done him proud you have dishonoured him. You’re the scum of the earth.” First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford condemned the “completely unacceptable” scenes that would “not be tolerated anywhere in Wales”. He thanked South Wales Police “for bringing the situation under control and continuing to monitor”. Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said the force would “stop at nothing” to find the offenders. He added in a tweet: “Saddened and furious at events in Swansea last night. “So many families will have been tormented by those responsible, rest assured we... will work hard with others to help and support local residents, who deserve better than this.” Local Welsh Parliament member Tom Gfard called the scenes “disturbing”. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: “A tough night for the police dealing with such reckless behaviour. No excuses, police right to robustly respond.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCrimeSouth Wales PoliceStately homesTeenagersPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid genuine loving gent","story":"NewsTributes paid to genuine loving gent killed when construction lt crashed to groundDavid Bottomley, , died when what is believed to have been an external construction lt plummeted to the ground - his son, , is still fighting for his le in hospitalmirrorShareCommentsByAlan Weston:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsFather and son David and Clayton Bottomley were involved in a fatal accident in Liverpool city centre \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Thataposs exactly what has happened to one woman, when she found herself on the verge of tears in the middle of a park, after making a worrying discovery. Jo Remedios, from New Ferry in Merseyside, was out walking her dog when she suddenly realised she had lost her house keys, and to make matters worse, the only spare key was with her husband, who was down in London.I started panicking and knocked at my neighbours. They had a ladder but I still needed the keys to open the door even from the inside, the -year-old explained to the Liverpool Echo. I thought Iaposll retrace my steps went back but I was hysterical. My partner is in London and heaposs the only one with another key and he was thinking heaposd have to drive home. Mid-panic and with no clue what  to do, Jo stopped three young boys who were riding through the park on bikes, and asked themtheyaposd be willing to help. I was like a mad woman all upset and these boys were going past on their bikes. I said, aposcan you please help me apos And they threw their bikes down and came over straight away, she added. I was just panicking thinking what am I going to do - I was nearly crying! They must have thought I was a mad woman in the park.  After around  minutes of searching, the boys, James Grant, nine, and brothers Oliver Langan  and Louis Langan, eight, managed to track down the missing keys lying in the grass and Joaposs nightmare came to an end.I was so relieved, so I said can I take your picture for Facebook  They said why and I said because youaposre amazing and youaposve helped me, she said, adding that she went straight home and posted a thank you message on social media.Jo posted the picture on Facebook, writing: Whosever parents these boys are they are a credit to you. I lost my keys whilst I let my dog have a run on the New Ferry park they threw their bikes down when they seen I was hysterical thinking I was locked out and stuck!!!!! Thank you so much, you lovely kind boys. The post was quickly inundated with comments praising the boys, and it was even spotted by their parents, who described their sons as true gentlemen and just lovely boys. It puts your faith back in people. They were just dead helpful, they were polite. They didnapost have to do what they did, they could have carried on going to the park. They were just lovely, absolutely lovely kids, Jo added. You hear so many bad things about kids I just thought they deserved the recognition. I just donapost know what I would have donethey hadnapost have been there to help me look. I was so lucky.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeWith his neck brutally pinned to the ground minutes from death, George Floyd locked eyes with Charles McMillian as he fought to speak his last few words. As others angrily focused on murderous police officer Derek Chauvin, the -year-old concentrated on the man whose le was ebbing away before him. “I just knew he was killing him,” said McMillian. “You could see it in George’s face. I could not help, as a black man in America and someone who has been arrested like he was, but think to myself that it could so easily have been me.” McMillian was speaking before the first anniversary of Floyd’s murder on Tuesday.His emotionally charged, powerful testimony paved the way for Chauvin’s murder conviction last month.  The father of eight wants to see the killer officer put away for le when he is sentenced on June . “He should get le,” he said. “They give us [black men] le, he should get le too. “I have no hard feelings towards Chauvin. I don’t want to give way to hate all I want to ask him is ‘Why ’” Fate brought McMillian and Chauvin together at the corner of th and Chicago Avenue in the tough southern district of Minneapolis on May  last year.  Five days earlier, the car wash worker had pulled level with the officer’s SUV at a red light. Looking across, he told Chauvin: “At the end of the day, go home to your family safe.” The policeman, , acknowledged his kindness before the light changed green, and the two went their separate ways. On the day of Floyd’s death, McMillian saw a police cruiser in his “hood” and stopped to see what was going on.  “Any other time, I might have just kept driving,” he explained. “We see this kind of thing every day in my hood. “I don’t know what made me stop this time. I was being nosy. Something told me something wasn’t right.” As he got out of his car, he became the first civilian on the scene of a crime that changed the world. He recalled: “The officer was trying to get him in the car and everything, talking to him.  I was telling him just to comply, get in the car because you can’t win. I’ve been where George was that day.” “I am not trying to win,” responded an increasingly distressed Floyd, who struggled with the police as they tried to get him into a police car. Repeatedly he told them he was “claustrophobic” and had anxiety. In now-famous videos, witnesses implore Chauvin to let Floyd, , breathe.  Yet McMillian, captured on police body cams wearing distinctive white framed glasses, a black T-shirt, beige shorts and white flip-flops, is the only one directly interacting with Floyd. “I kept my eyes focused only on George,” said McMillian, who can be heard pleading “Get up.” “I will. I can’t move,” Floyd responds. McMillian said: “It was then George began beginning for his mom. ‘Mama. Mama. Mama,’ he was crying out.  It really brought home how much he was struggling to live. I’d lost my mom a year before, and the pain was still raw in me. I understood him. “Chauvin didn’t care though. He seemed high on the power he had. “I said to him, ‘the man said he couldn’t breathe.’ They said, ‘ he keeps talking, well, he can breathe.’” After nine minutes and  seconds, Chauvin finally removed his weight as an ambulance arrived.  The attending paramedic said he was dead. After the body is removed, McMillian confronts Chauvin. Reminding him of their previous encounter, he tells him he “does not respect” what he just did and calls him a “maggot”. Today, McMillian says he hopes racism in America will be defeated but is fearful Floyd’s death will be in vain.  He said: “Being black in America is a disadvantaged way of le. George died for the colour of his skin, not from the crime they accused him of committing.” McMillian grew up picking cotton alongside his mother, Queen, on a farm in Mississippi. He moved from Aberdeen to Minnesota when he was . He bounced from one unskilled job to another and suffered from alcohol and drug addiction, but has been sober since .

As we spoke with McMillian and his son, Charlie, , gunfire broke out  yards away between gang members. McMillian said: “Everything goes on in my hood. There is no dference today than before George was killed. It’s as dangerous now as it was then.” Though he is not hopeful for America, McMillian hopes people in the UK will continue to fight racial inequality. He said: “If anything good has come from George’s murder it’s that people are ready to be heard.” He has not been contacted by Floyd’s family or lawyers, but said: “It would be nice to meet them one day. I was the last brother George spoke to.”Charles McMillianaposs son has set up an online fundraiser for his dad to visit his mumaposs grave. You can help him here.

We were shocked when we realised someone was using a train carriage to live in.”Of course, across Britain and beyond there are thousands of ordinary-looking homes with some seriously unique selling points. Ball pits, lavish jungles and secret pub rooms that put your local to shame - these grand designs might give you an idea for that next big DIY project. Having a ball  Once used as a Second World War command centre, this period Victorian home is no short of history. Yet in recent years, itaposs become more of a fun house - hiding an entire ball pit ideal for keeping the kids busy for a few hours. The five-bed house in Lincolnshire - said to have once been the residence of the Mayor of Grimsby - was snapped up quickly after being put up for sale for £,.  Complete with hundreds of plastic balls, colourful walls and a climbing net, the basement is anything but dark and dingy. Frankly, we wouldnapost blame the adults for taking over the room occasionally - it looks like a perfect way to beat lockdown boredom. Jungle fever  Ever struggled to keep a pesky houseplant alive  Well take a leaf out of the book of Nick Wilson, who brought an entire rain forest to le in his back yard. The software salesman spent  years and £, on this incredible project after being inspired by family holidays to Cornwall in the s.  The semi-detached home in Leeds is stuffed full of ferns, bamboos and big leaf plants, and has welcomed hundreds of visitors since opening to the public. I had no idea that I liked big, thick enormous plants so much, said Nick. It was just such a dference to soft, fluffy garden plants. Itaposs definitely a blokeaposs garden.  My inspiration came from family holidays to Cornwall in the s and suddenly my back garden was overflowing with massive plants. The father and grandfather of one has since raised thousands of pounds through viewings for charities including Marie Curie and McMillan. Best bar none  Ok, so this dreamy getaway in Adelaide, Australia, is far from an ordinary home anyway, with a massive pool to relax in during those scorching summers. Nonetheless, its best feature is hidden away behind an old bank vault door - a fully-stocked pub cellar complete with a vast booze menu on the walls.  The amazing bar comes with a truly massive wine rack, beers and spirits on tap, and a jukebox in the corner. Put up for sale at around £,, the ultra-modern house features three bedrooms and - crucially after an all-night bar session - four bathrooms.  Local estate agents Harcourts Sergeant said the owners installed the vault doors especially for the secret getaway.“The business that they own, they actually install bank vault doors,” they told Real Estate.Com.Au.“That’s why they put that door in there, just as something a little bit dferent. Letting this one slide  This grand mansion in Alyth, Perthshire boasts nine bedrooms... and a curious way to get out of one. Starting in one of the upstairs rooms and twirling down to the kitchen is a huge metal slide - ideal for getting breakfast in a rush.  The stainless steel contraption cost £, to install at the Highland retreat, which went on the market for £,. The stunning property also has five bathrooms, a granny flat and an attached holiday cottage, accessible through a separate door.  A spokesman for Edinburgh-based agents McEwan Fraser Legal said: “The owner was keen for the slide to go in as they felt the house had lots of things in it for the adults and they wanted to have something special for kids. “Any child will love this unique feature and will never be late for a meal again. Animal kingdom  This Grade II-listed property in Cranford, Northamptonshire, might require a bit of workyou want to put your own stamp on it. Behind its well-kept lawns and humble exterior lies a new surprise in every photo - ranging from golden bedrooms to decadent chandeliers and a zooaposs worth of stuffed animals.  On a grand table in the conservatory sits a giant peacock, while deer heads and birds fill every corner of the home. The interiors are a bold mish-mash of wooden ling, vintage clocks, and animal-print wallpaper, and even the ceilings of the bedrooms look like they were painted by Michelangelo.  Said to have been inspired by the interiors of Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, the two-bed cottage was bought last year after going on sale for £,. An online description said the home had been fully renovated and uniquely styled, featuring hand-painted wall coverings, a custom-designed kitchen and bathroom suites, reclaimed oak flooring and French polished doors. It added: The layout offers a living room with large fireplace, kitchen dining room, conservatory, two double bedrooms and a bathroom.Externally, there is a gravelled driveway with electronic gates for access and a Mediterranean style, low maintenance garden. Gardeneraposs world  From the outside this looks like an ordinary terrace house - neatly painted and with a tidy garden and driveway in front. But this property in Salford, Greater Manchester gives way to a ginormous garden paradise thanks to the work of a determined gran.  Sally Berry worked tirelessly to transform the swampy two-acre plot that came with the home into a remarkable apossecret valleyapos complete with tumbling waterfalls. It is now filled with wildflowers and plants native to Britain, sitting alongside tranquil streams and rockery. Unusual statues fills odd little nooks and crannies in the stunning space. It even comes with its own lake, which now welcomes nesting swans, geese and kingfishers..  Sally said: It has been fun to design and fun to take on a place that no one  wanted. It was a challenge but I have actually enjoyed it all. It kind of invented itself as it went along. I have had the most pleasure seeing it change. Last but not East  Fancy an exotic holiday  Just step into the back yard of this four-bed home in Wales. Don and Ann Knightaposs garden is an Asian paradise and includes a tranquil, five-foot deep Koi pond, a Japanense Torri gate, a pagoda and even an Amazon waterfall.  As well as their perfectly manicured lawns, there are also dozens of tiny bonsai trees, which have to be tended to daily.Ann told Wales Online : I met Don and he bought me the pagoda for my first Christmas present and it went from there.When I said you can do what you want to the garden I didnapost expect this.  Don was just  when he first tried his hand at growing bonsai and has been fascinated with the tiny trees ever since. And keeping the beautul garden in Llantwit Manor in perfect condition is a full-time job for the couple, who have spent thousands of pounds over the years on it. Grandmother-of-one Ann said of her husband: Heaposs always in the garden.

Nick Murray went viral on TikTok for sharing his epic tanning fail - but itaposs not quite what you think. Nick, , lives in Mexico with his girlfriend and their pals. In a TikTok video shared on  May, Nick joked that heaposd accidentally fallen asleep on the beach while wearing his Covid- face mask.  As a result, the content creator had woken up to some hilarious tan lines across his face that looked exactly like a white mask. However, everything is not quite as it seems - as Nick had actually used a filter to fool his followers into thinking he was left with the embarrassing tan lines. And the stunt left TikTok users confused, racking up over , likes and over . million views. People flocked to comment on the video too, although not everyone was convinced it was real.  One person wrote: Well heck. Also, why are you wearing a mask at the beach, and also that looks like a filter. Nah... thataposs makeup, another person said. Itaposs a filter, totally see the lines move, one TikTok user added. Others were confused as to why Nick was even wearing a mask on the beach in the first place. Question is... why are you wearing a mask on the beach  Youaposre outside, another person wrote. Another person added: Wearing a mask at the beach  This was deserved. Nick confirmed he used a mask filter as a joke and did not have any tan lines on his face. Iaposm currently just out here living in a TikTok house with other creators and yes it is a filter, Nick said. I thought the reaction online was funny but thataposs what itaposs all about!

In the video, which has k likes, she almost fills the bowl with a thick blue liquid, which she then dips a toilet brush into before scrubbing every inch of the toilet. The video is comprised of a series of short clips, and in each of which the bowl is very nearly full of the odd looking liquid.  She repeatedly dips her brush into the liquid, before scrubbing the cistern, the seat, and the top of the bowl. While the video had many positive comments, some internet users were left baffled by what they had seen. One user, Summer Howells, said: What did I just get myself into  And another said: Fever dream vibes. Another added: This video is giving me anxiety.  And one user asked: Are you making slime in there or something  And another wrote: You definitely messed up your whole plumbing system. Daisaaposs has uploaded many videos to her TikTok page and they all bear many similarities. Filmed from the first-person perspective, they show Daisa cleaning the house with a iety of multi-coloured liquids and aposhomemade scrubs, as well as fulfilling her followeraposs requests. She characteristically uses a lot of these products, so each item she cleans looks like a dissolved rainbow before she rinses it down. Some of the videos are wildly popular with over a million views, and they appear to be growing in popularity.What do you think of the cleaning trick, will you give it a go  Let us know in the comments...

Siri Hafso said that until  she loved her name, as she would be complimented on how unique it was and she would watch people struggle to pronounce it after reading it for the first time. But all that changed when Apple introduced their digital assistant and named it Siri, and since then Siri has had the most common name in the world. Sheaposs also had to endure years of jokes and now she feels she is owed something in , so has written to the Calornia based company to ask for a free computer.  The letter, which Siri shared on TikTok, reads: Hello Tim, Iaposll get right to it - I have a favour to ask. You see my name is Siri. Yes, Siri. And up until , I was the kid who could never find their name on a keychain at the souvenir shop. I was the teen who knew when the nurses were about to call me because they would look at the clipboard in confusion not knowing how to pronounce my name. I was the young adult who was always told aposyouaposre name is so beautul and unique!apos I think you can see where this is going.  The rest of the letter is obscured, but on the TikTok video Siri explains how she has had to endure years of jokes about her name, and she is hoping Apple will give her a computer for her th birthday as thataposs her aposonly wishapos.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA woman has been slammed after she criticised a wedding gt her mum planned to give her. In an anonymous post on Mumsnet, the woman, who is getting married, said that her mum wanted to give the couple a sentimental gt to congratulate them on their big day. But on top of that, she offered to pay to renovate a property they might be renting from hertheyaposre not able to purchase somewhere of their own after their house sells. Without sounding ungrateful, I’m a bit confused as to how her paying for renovations done on her own home is a gt  she said.And no it’s not that she is also going to give me the house, definitely not, I know that for a fact. The woman went on to say that it was her mum who offered for them to stay in the house while they save up, because house prices where we live have shot up an insane amount in the last year, and we have to sell up as it’s the developers buying the house back off us as there has been a lot of issues with it .  Originally, they were going live in a caravan at her Dad’s property temporarily, until her Mum suggested they live in a house she owns. The woman continued: When we started talking about the idea and my partner and I agreed. She then went on about doing some work on the house, new kitchen, new bathroom, maybe even adding an en-suite upstairs, and she said I could decide what to put in there and she would give me a budget.Fine, I’m good with these things as I used to work somewhere which involved some interior designing. But then things went south.I informed her recently that we are still actively looking for somewhere to buy when we exchange contracts with our current house - she was always aware of this, so it’s never been a definite thing that we were to move there, andwe did, I always mentioned that it would only be for a year or two, max. Last time I spoke to her and said that we have a viewing on Saturday, and all being well we will put an offer in and hope it’s accepted, she didn’t reply back, she said.She asked Mumsnet users whether she was being unreasonable for thinking that gting us renovations done on her own home, that we may not even live in anyway, is unacceptable  Or am I ungrateful  One person said: No, renovations are not a wedding gt. Whilst another user commented: It does sound pretty grabby to be saying that your Mum isn’t giving you an aposacceptableapos wedding gt. Maybe you would prefer bed linen or wine glasses or whatever. But she is giving you a huge financial advantage in letting you live in herhouse. From the way you posted, it sounds like she’s also intending to give you a sentimental, personal item. I just can’t see why you’d be disappointed or expect more  A third then added: Honestly thereaposs nothing more off-putting than a bride and groom hung up on what gts theyaposre going to get. Meanwhile, someone  put: I’m a bit confused as to why giving you something apossentimentalapos isn’t an adequate wedding gt  to which the woman reiterated that it wasnapost the sentimental gt she felt was unacceptable, but the renovations. The something sentimental is definitely adequate, the original poster explained. I don’t understand how her telling me that paying to get her house done is also a gt for me, this is what confuses me. The reason I find it unacceptable is because I’ve never said I would definitely be moving there and have always made it known that I’m actively looking for another house so why is she telling me that she’s getting these things done for my benefit when in reality it’s not. She was going to get these things done evenI didn’t move there. I’m confused as I feel like I should appreciate and thank her for something that is not needed Do you think paying for renovations is a wedding gt  Let us know in the comments.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The elderly patient was told that he would have to have the limb removed because a previous illness had affected it. The -year-old, who is suffering from a host of medical ailments, went to the Freistadt Clinic close to the Czech border in Austria for the operation. When he awoke from the procedure he was horried to discover that his right rather than left leg had been chopped off. “We are deeply shocked that on Tuesday, May , despite quality assurance standards, the wrong leg of an -year old man ... was amputated,” a spokesperson for the clinic said.  They added that the mistake was first noticed during a bandage change on Thursday morning. The error appears to have been made shortly before the operation, when the leg that was to be amputated was marked. “Unfortunately the mistake, in which the right leg was removed instead of the left, occurred as a result of a sequence of unfortunate circumstances,” it said, adding that it was investigating what happened and would review its standards. The patient has been offered psychological assistance and must still undergo another operation to remove his left leg from mid-thigh. “The operation is planned shortly,” the clinic said.  Wrong-sided amputations are not only endured by Austrian patients. Between April  and July ,  ‘never events’ occurred in NHS hospitals - blunders so serious they should never happen. That’s the equivalent of nine patients every week, according to data obtained by PA news agency.

Max Anderson was the man to drop to the bench.Marshall, meanwhile, was only fit enough for a place on the bench after five weeks out. He was joined by striker Jason Cummings as a substitute with Danny Mullen leading the line.The dangermen started for the Premiership side with Chris Burke looking to provide service for striker Kyle Lafferty.A huge roar erupted from the  home fans as Dundee kicked off, shooting towards the empty Bob Shankly Stand in the first half.The rain was teaming down with a chill wind but there was no dampening of voices at the other end.They were up again seconds into the contest as Shaun Byrne crunched into Greg Kiltie in midfield.The real roar came on six minutes, though, as Dundee got off to the perfect start.And it was that man McGhee with another key play-off goal.Charlie Adam found time in the middle to chip perfectly over the defence for the run of Cammy Kerr.With his left-foot the full-back sent the ball in first time to find the head of Mullen.Colin Doyle got to it but could only push the ball onto the post. Following in was McGhee, however, and he got his reward with a tap-in on the line.And it could easily have been - inside  minutes as Paul McMullan found himself through on goal.He took his time but couldn#t beat Doyle from the angle.On the quarter-hour mark Killie threatened for the first time as Lafferty ran the channel in behind Fontaine before curling an effort well wide.As the conditions worsened, the visitors began to work the ball and work the Dundee defence.They weren#t getting much change out of the Dark Blues players charged up by the boisterous  in the stand, though.The contest meandered towards half-time with neither side able to create much on the slippy pitch and howling wind.Kilmarnock boss Tommy Wright wasn#t happy with his side#s performance, either, giving the dugout a good whack and his players an earful.Four minutes before the break Dundee did create a look at goal and, once more, McGhee was the man.Mullen did well to get down the left flank before cutting back for the midfielder. McGhee#s effort, though, was deflected into the side-netting.A quick start to the first half was followed by a fast start to the second.Dundee shooting towards the home fans, the script was written for only one man.Harassing play from Christie Elliott saw McMullan pinch the ball off Gary Dicker and cut the ball back.Playing in front of a home crowd for the first time, lelong Dee Adam was on hand to fire the Dark Blues - ahead.And his celebration in front of the cheering fans showed just how much that meant.After  months away it wouldn#t take much to get the Dundee fans behind their team.Their team, though, was responding to every shout, every bit of encouragement from the -strong support.On  minutes it was almost - as Killie let possession slip once more, allowing Mullen to run into the area.His effort was well-struck but Doyle was equal to it with a good stop.With  minutes remaining, Killie got their leline.There was an element of luck about it as a combination of Mullen and Kerr blocked Haunstrup#s first effort.The ball, though, dropped perfectly for the full-back to slot through the legs of Adam Legzdins.And it was almost level just moments later as Legzdins had to be sharp to beat the ball out at his front post.The nerves were obvious from the support every time Kilmarnock ventured forward in the closing stages.There was still plenty going the other way, too, but there would be no more scoring.That leaves Dundee just one game away from promotion back to the top flight, heading to Rugby Park on Monday with a -

Fontaine and Marshall have been training and we’ve no new concerns from last Thursday. We’ve almost a full squad.“I was holding Fontaine back. Marsh, kind of, but it was more trying to control his workload more without risking him in a game.“We wanted to get the high speed running into him because that’s what his game is about.“That’s where his injuries usually come from, so we tried to do that in a controlled way.“We had a - cushion and were confident going into the game. We weren’t going to risk Fontaine because we knew we’d have him back for Thursday’s game.“It’s great to have a full squad to choose from. Jack Hamilton and Fin Robertson are the two senior ones who are missing at the minute but apart from that, everyone is healthy and can play and be on the pitch.”The Dark Blues head into the double-header in good heart after an impressive run of form saw them finish second on the final day of the Championship.Though defeat to Raith last time out ended their nine-match unbeaten streak, the confidence built up won’t be dulled.And McPake says the experience scattered throughout his squad will ensure that is the case.He added: “It’s a boost for our team any time they turn round and look at each other.“Paul McGowan scored a penalty in front of , people at Hampden, a full house, in a semi-final against Celtic.“Shaun Byrne’s won in the playoffs with Livingston. Jason Cummings and Liam Fontaine played in the cup final when Hibs hadn’t won the cup.“I’ve been at Hibs and I know how important that game was for them.“Charlie Adam is an exceptional talent and an exceptional player. He’s got real, real experience of high pressure games.“When you look about our squad, and you see the names of the players in there, then you’re glad they’re standing beside you.#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown\" title\"#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-wow-fans-with-fabric-of-the-city-new-kit-launch-ahead-of-kilmarnock-promotion-showdown embed # secretmuWVH\" data-secret\"muWVH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/SMac_John_Alexander_Council_Dundee_22772911-847x564.jpg ","title":"pledge to help most vulnerable in dundee recover from pandemic","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remYoung people, the elderly and the unemployed are among those disproportionately affected by the pandemic in Dundee, a new report shows.Support services in the city must now be geared towards helping them, along with other vulnerable groups, including those suffering from mental health issues.The findings and recommendations for improvement come in the latest report by Dundee#s Fairness Commission.The report identies  key areas where work must be undertaken to improve services to promote fairness in the city.It includes actions relating to food and fuel poverty, disability, mental health and wellbeing.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander has now pledged to find a way to help bring the city out of poverty following the pandemic.In the foreword for the report, he said: #The last year has been hard for everyone and the Covid- lockdown has had huge consequences for all of us.#Covid- has made le even harder for people who were already struggling with low incomes and many more families will be feeling what it is like to try to get by without enough coming into the house because of the economic impact of the lockdown.#It’s our job now to focus on helping the city recover. We must shape our recovery plans to help us secure the fairer Dundee we believe is right.#Lockdown has shown us that we can develop solutions quickly when we put our minds to it. I want to see us do the same when it comes to reducing poverty.#Top priorities for  improvement include installing more efficient heating systems in Lochee#s multis, creating a food insecurity strategy and increasing access to employability support for people struggling with mental health issues.It also recommends that services should be more proactive in addressing the impact of financial uncertainty on people’s mental health.The findings also show that others adversely and disproportionately affected by Covid- include the long-term sick or disabled, those in receipt of benefits, those living alone and carers.The report has been met with a mixed response from campaigners in Dundee.Leading Dundee mental health campaigner Phil Welsh branded the findings #patronising empty rhetoric# but pensioners# champion Dorothy McHugh said she thought the report was #impressive#.Phil Welsh, who has been campaigning for a   mental health crisis for Dundee since his son, Lee, committed suicide, said he was very disappointed in the report.#The mental health aspect of the report is a patronising empty rhetoric,# he said.#This is a -page report with nothing of major concern to help address Dundee as the suicide capital of mainland Scotland.#Where is the crisis centre, where are the mental health professionals who should be located in GP practices, where is the emergency mental health rapid response vehicle, where are the additional out of hour resources, where are the proposals to make the bridge a safer place #He added: #Of course there is no panacea, however, vague reports such as this curry no favour with mental health campaigners who have been expressing what the city really needs for many years.#However, Dorothy, secretary of Dundee Pensioners# Forum, said: #This is an impressive report – highlighting the layers of complex issues that people across our city struggle with on a daily basis.#The council leader’s foreword emphasises the effects of the Covid- pandemic and pledges to help the city recover.#This is right, of course, but many of the problems outlined in the report are long-standing and have been thrown into stark relief during Covid- restrictions.#Social isolation, for example, is not new # certainly not to our most vulnerable groups across the city, including older people.#Many of those who suffer from social isolation are also affected by disability, food and fuel insecurity and mental health issues.##The report addresses all of these issues in clear language and offers well thought through recommendations that,implemented, would certainly move us some way forward to a Dundee that listens to its people.#A spokesman for the fairness commission said: #Our desire was to search out the issues people are struggling with today, to hear their stories and find ways to make a dference.#There was no agenda, paperwork or action points.#We spent this time listening together to the stories and experiences of community commissioners.#After each story-sharing we discussed and drew out key themes, finding the common#This has shown the obvious wealth ide#: Anti-poverty group relaunches to address coronavirus impact\" title\"##This has shown the obvious wealth ide#: Anti-poverty group relaunches to address coronavirus impact# #

taking on the challenge of travelling from Lands’ End to John o’ Groats to raise money for two north-east charities.Riding his Honda C scooter Derek will cover more than  miles of road starting his adventure on Sunday evening.In the process he will raise vital funds for Charlie House # a charity which supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families in the region.The Leanne Fund will also benefit from Derek’s time on the road. It is considered the foremost Cystic Fibrosis charity in Scotland, working with patients and families across the Highlands, Islands and Grampian to provide vital social, practical, emotional and financial assistance for the whole family.Talking about his upcoming adventure, Derek, Yard Supervisor for John Lawrie Metals, said: “I had originally planned to do the trip to mark my th birthday last year so it’s exciting to finally be counting down to setting off.#I’ll be hitting the road on Monday, May  on my Honda C. It has a top speed of mph and a tank range of about  miles so there will be a few stops along the  plus mile route.#I’ll be followed by a support team and there may even be a surprise visitor popping up. I’m hoping to complete the journey in less than four days.#I would like to thank every person and business, including my employer John Lawrie, that has supported me so far.#I’m delighted with the donations received and of course the generous time my support crew have and will give me throughout the challenge. This trip couldn’t be done on my own so I’m really grateful for everyone’s support.”Donna Deans, fundraising co-ordinator at Charlie House added: “There have been rumours that Charlie Dog is going away for a few days so it’s quite possible that he might show up somewhere between Lands’ End and John o’ Groats to support Derek as he takes on this challenge.“We’re grateful to Derek, and others like him, who continue to think of others and raise money for charity. Their support is incredibly important to us, it helps us to continue our work providing much needed support to babies, children and young people and their families.”Referring to his decision to support Charlie House, Derek added: “I went to a Charlie House Ball in  and was really impressed by the powerful work the charity does. Quite simply I couldn’t ignore the need to do my bit to support them. I have almost reached my initial target of raising £, and now hope to raise even more to benefit the families Charlie House works with, as well as The Leanne Fund.”The funds raised will enable Charlie House to continue its work and to support babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families in the north-east of Scotland.Charlie House has a range of services and fundraising activities including The Big Build Appeal, a public fundraising campaign to raise £million for a specialist support centre being built on the grounds of Woodend Hospital.The centre will have eight-bedrooms, with additional family accommodation, set in four acres of ground.The modern building will feature a sensory room, library, spa pool, craft room, teen den, soft play area, therapy room, star room, for end-of-le care and bereavement, outdoor play area and sensory gardens as well as adaptable meeting space and office space for the Charlie House team and medical staff.Charlie House’s services which are currently being run virtually include activity clubs, siblings’ clubs, support from the Charlie House community nurse, one-to-one emotional and practical support from the children and family support manager.It is hoped that their bi-annual adventure trip to Kielder Forest Park, run by the Calvert Trust s following easing of lockdown and ongoing restrictions and when it is safe to do so.To donate to Derek Micthell’s fundraiser visit his Virgin Money Giving Page at https:uk.virginmoneygiving fundraiser-display showROFundraiserPage userUrlDerekMitchell#pageUrlFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.24287141-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.24287141-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.24287141-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.24287141-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"attention fast food fans taco bell to open drive through in aberdeen next month","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen#s first Taco Bell drive-thru will open next month.The Mexican food franchise opened its first branch in the Granite City last year and it has become hugely popular # with queues of delivery drivers often spotted waiting outside on Union Street during lockdown.Now the chain is opening a second -seat restaurant at Haudagain Retail Park on June .

to transform neglected playing fields that have been littered with needles and dog mess into a safe field of dreams for children to play football.The Thornhill grounds in the south of the Moray town have been popular with dog walkers since being created a decade ago as part of a housing development.However, mess from the household pets as well as reports of needles have put off children from using the park as a regular place for games.Local resident Wayne Grant now has a vision to transform the playing fields into an attractive place for children to stay active while keeping out of trouble.Offshore worker Mr Grant embarked on the campaign to establish two five-a-side pitches and a rounders field to give youngsters a safe place to play.After setting an initial fundraising target of £,, the father-of-two has now raised nearly £, after being inundated with donations from local parents and groups.He hopes his sports daft nine-year-old son Mitchell will be able to enjoy the benefits after becoming frustrated at a lack of progress from where.Not every family can afford to pay to book a pitch.#He said: “We’ve stayed in the Grange development from day one for  years. There were promises of playparks for the kids but nothing has ever happened.“You get a lot of dog walkers here and they just let them foul everywhere and it’s such a shame because it could be such a good place.“Not every family can afford to pay to book a pitch to play, they just want somewhere to kick a ball about.“As soon as I put something on the Grange Facebook page there were a lot of people getting touch to say it was a brilliant idea.“I’ve spoken to the community police officer too. They ran street football on the High Street recently and said it got a good response from  to -year-olds because it was just somewhere for them to go and play.”Moray Council has backed Mr Grant’s vision to create five-a-side football pitches and a rounders field at the Thornhill grounds.The local authority has praised the dad’s plans as an example for other communities to follow.A spokeswoman said: “Moray Council is keen to support community groups encouraging the use of our open spaces and the Thornhill pitches are a great example of a community facility in New Elgin that would benefit from more use.“We’re in the process of assisting Mr Grant by marking out two five-a-side pitches in the Thornhill playing field area.“The new rounders pitch will also make a great addition for young people in the area to make the most of without having to book. We look forward to continuing to empower communities to undertake projects like this across Moray.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/IMG_20210426_122250273-e1619456914505-604x372.jpg ","title":"stonehavens open air swimming pool to make a splash at reopening next weekend","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remThe north-east#s only open air swimming pool will reopen next weekend #

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"lots to do for new argyll and bute msp","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"new member makes his mark at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners.

The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

England.Heres what you need to know:The First Minister confirmed that Glasgow will stay in Level  lockdown.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Over the past  days, there have been extensive public health measures deployed across the city - including enhanced testing and vaccination in the areas with the highest rates of Covid, especially in G and G.She added: \"Last week, we were seeing  cases for every , of the population - thats now risen to .\"That increase will partly be due to the fact theres more testing being done, but the percentage of positive tests has also increased from .% to %.\"In summary, we dont think that we have turned the corner in Glasgow yet.\"Let me stress that were confident the major public health interventions underway will be effective, and they will bring the virus rates back under control - but they need a bit longer to do that.\"We also need a bit more time to be confident than we are now that vaccination will stop the rising case numbers today becoming severe illness and sharply rising hospital numbers a couple of weeks from now.\"So for all these reasons, I can confirm today that regrettably, Glasgow will remain in Level  for another week at this stage.\"I know, not least because I live in Glasgow myself, how unwelcome this is for iniduals and businesses - but I hope it wont be for much longer.\"Nicola Sturgeon announced that East Renfrewshire will stay in Level  despite high case numbers.The First Minister said: \"On the face of it, levels in East Renfrewshire - as a proportion of the population - are actually slightly higher than in Glasgow.\"Im acutely aware that people might therefore look at the raw data and sayGlasgow is in Level , East Renfrewshire should be there too.\"But as youve heard me say many times before, and I know this is really dficult, the situation underneath the raw data is often more complex and its the detailed analysis that we must try to base our decisions on.\"For example, while the cases per , in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire are similar, the total number of cases in East Renfrewshire - because its a smaller area, obviously - is signicantly smaller than in Glasgow.\"To illustrate that, yesterday there were actually just  new cases reported in East Renfrewshire - compared to  in Glasgow. More importantly, many more of the cases in East Renfrewshire can be traced to specic household clusters, unlike in Glasgow.\"That means that we think strong and targeted public health measures have more of a chance of stemming the rise in East Renfrewshire, without the need to use wider restrictions.\"Taking all of that into account, our judgement - and these decisions are often finely balanced - is that East Renfrewshire should stay at Level  for now, although this will be kept under close review and well continue to use enhanced public health measures.\"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that Moray will move to Level  from midnight tonight.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Im very pleased to say that the situation has actually improved very signicantly.\"Last week, the area was reporting  new cases a week per , - thats now fallen to .\"Positivity rate in Moray has also fallen quite markedly, from .% a week ago to .% now.\"In addition, the April- iant does not seem to be as commonly present in Moray as it is in Glasgow and indeed other parts of the country.\"Im able to confirm today that Moray will now move down from Level  to Level , taking effect on midnight tonight.\"This, I know, will be welcome news for people and businesses in Moray - and its been made possible by efforts of local public health teams and the public.\"I would say though that its important to remain careful.\"Being in Level  still comes with necessary restrictions, so please stick to those and do everything you can to help Moray to enjoy more freedoms and more easing of restrictions later this summer.\"The First Minister announced travel restrictions between Scotland and three areas in England.NS: \"However, there are particularly serious outbreaks of the April- iant in three specic areas of England: Bedford, Bolton and Blackburn  Darwen.\"For that reason, from Monday, we are imposing temporary travel restrictions on travel between Scotland and those  areas.\"Soyou were planning to visit friends or relatives, or to say in those areas -

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

It could be your living room or home office, or simply a bright corner of your kitchen or a balconyyou live in a flat. Just wherever you feel good and where you can relax like you would on holiday, surrounded by plants.Are there rules for where you place your plants Plants love light and require it for photosynthesis. However, the amount of light they need to thrive is particular to each plant. For example, cacti and succulents generally love the bright sun on the windowsill.Which plants are likely to give you least trouble Calathea zebrina, aloe, sansevieria, spider plants, pothos and peace lily.How do you match your plants to your decor Find your plants some beautul pots and baskets. Perhaps you could go for a handwoven basket that matches the colour palette and style of your interior. This may be custom-designed, a classic terracotta pot, a vintage planter, or you can even make your own ceramic pots at a workshop.Which houseplants are trickier to grow Usually, plants that grow in very dferent native conditions such as high humidity can pose some challenges when growing them indoors. This includes alocasia, the banana palm and some philodendrons. Others such as the date palm require specic temperatures and lots of space to grow, which can also present challenges indoors.Which houseplants prefer shadier conditions For shadier conditions we recommend the ZZ plant , epipremnum, the Philodendron Brasil, as well as colocasia and azalea.Which houseplants can be moved to a sunny patio or balcony and can be left out in summer As long as temperatures dont drop too muchduring the warmer months, plants like the banana palm, kentia palm, agaves, opuntia, kalanchoe, crassula, haworthia and chamaerops palm can be kept outside at night.Some, like the palms and certain succulents, can even be kept outdoors all year long, but need to be protected from frost. Also ensure the soil and pot are well drained to prevent root rot due to heavy rainfall.How can the plants be cared for when the weather cools Before bringing your plants inside, check them for pests that they picked up outside. Make sure you find them a spot in your home where they get a similar amount of daylight as on your balcony or patio.Expect some leaf drop from the adjustment to new light conditions, which is normal, and help your plant by removing the dead leaves.Avoid any extreme changes in temperature and dont put your plants near or on top of the radiator, or next to a front door that opens frequently, as sudden hot and cold draughts can cause the plants stress.When you bring your plants inside, or when you start heating your home again during the colder months, adjust your watering schedule. Most plants require less water during hibernation, butyour apartment is very dry, use a humidier to keep your plants happy.Also, foliage growth slows down considerably during autumn and winter so you can stop fertilising until spring.Which houseplants will match your chosen destination Moroccan riad: Banana palm, papyrus plant, colocasia, Phoenix canariensis , bougainvillea, oleander, agave.Mediterranean haven: Lavender, Opuntia cacti, eucalyptus, olive tree, any kind of citrus tree, Chamaerops palm.Australian rainforest: Kentia palm, Schefflera actinophyla, umbrella tree, Epipremnum pinnatum, Alocasia brisbanensis, Hoya australis, Staghorn fern.South African safari: Strelitzia nicolai, kalanchoe, Zamioculcas zamiolia, string of pearls, crassula, Euphorbia ingens, haworthia, protea.Japanese garden: Azalea, Japanese spindle, moss balls , bonsai trees, a mini zen garden, Japanese painted fern.Amazonian jungle: Philodendrons of all sorts including monsteras, Thaumatophyllum xanadu, Calathea Burle Marxii, Calathea ornata, Begonia maculata, orchids, airplants, heliconia, dieffenbachia."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-government-allowed-human-nature-let-fans-ibrox","story":"In the circumstances it is not surprising that their dedicated fans wanted to celebrate boisterously.However, like many, I was totally appalled at the scenes of Rangers fans all crowding together and behaving so badly.

In my book this makes the Scottish Government culpable for the scenes in Glasgow, yet I see that the same Scottish Government is now heaping all the blame on to the football club and trying to work out how to punish it.Itrsquos no good Nicola Sturgeon emoting about how she feels our painshe does not understand human nature.

It is noticeable that the carnage has not been condemned by Tory politicians or by Scotland in Union officials.Mr Wilson also ignores the clear scientic advice that shows poor ventilation in crowded indoor situations combined with the effects of alcohol makes the spreading of Covid much more likely.There is no reason for Scotland to follow Boris Johnsonrsquos disastrous handling of Covid as illustrated by his failure to put India on the red list which allowed thousands to travel to the UK and bring the more virulent Indian iant to Glasgow, thus making it much more dficult to reopen hospitality venues and football stadiums.If Glasgow has to suffer further or extended restrictions thanks to the selfish actions of those Rangers supporters in George Square, then itrsquos guaranteed Mr Wilson will blame the SNP.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT THE BILETHE headline over Brian Wilsons article states that the \"SNP ... guaranteed George Square chaos\". Younger readers may not be aware of Mr Wilsons long history of visceral opposition to Scottish independence. Does he believe that the poisonous tribalism which afflicts our society in the West of Scotland and beyond and which sustains the dominance of the \"Old Firm\" over Scottish football is attributable in whole or in part to the SNP It may have escaped the notice of Mr Wilson and many others that the championships of SPFL League  and League  in  were also won by Glasgow teams. The smaller and more local tribes which support Partick Thistle and Queens Park were equally joyful and held celebrations which attracted little or no media attention.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WAS THERE UNITY IN A COMMON CAUSE NEIL Mackay claims that \"sectarianism shows a Scottish face to the world\" .As is understood, the tribal Rangers Celtic Protestant Catholic ide arose from immigration in previous centuries.It is to be hoped that sectarianism in the west of Scotland gathers less publicity when the world looks at Pollokshields and the strong public intervention to stop brutal dawn raids on two immigrants who were from a country far away.It would be interesting to knowthat gathering included many Rangers and Celtic supporters united in that effort to prevent the immigrantsrsquo deportation. Or in the same George Square on Sunday after the Rangers mayhem in the previous hours, who knowsthose united at the peaceful rally for Palestinians from another country far away from Scotland included Rangers and Celtic supporters protesting in that common cause Maybe any future humanitarian-type protestations could show a representation of peaceful Rangers and Celtic supporters in their colours to show the world that the destructive face of sectarianism is promoted only by a flawed section of small-minded people who are outnumbered by the big-hearted people of Scotland. This may help discard bigotry and prejudice as all come together to promote a better face to the world of concern and kindness to the desperate and the downtrodden.Irene Munro, Conon Bridge.CAUSE FOR DISMAY AND CONCERNWE would need to have a heart of stone not to have been moved by the words of Canon Matt McManus .

It transpired that they were not of the Islamic faith, rather Sikhism.

But this was a real opportunity to tackle recovery hand-in-hand with positive climate and ecological action, and to genuinely commit to a united, all-hands-on-deck approach across industry, science and technology, energy, agriculture and food production, education, travel, transport and health sectors.It was an opportunity to get behind the far-reaching Climate and Ecological EmergencyBill proposed by Caroline Lucas and endorsed by  MPs from all opposition parties.With six months until Glasgow is to host COP, and only three weeks until the G Summit in Cornwall, it is an opportunity missed. And itrsquos not just the Tories. Strikingly absent from our recent Scottish election campaign were climate and nature, except for in the Scottish Greens manesto, with a passing mention from the Lib Dems and Labour.The CEE Bill commits to ambitious action on climate and bioersity, greater protection for nature and stronger criteria for justice and responsibility. Central to the bill is the creation of a Citizensrsquo Assembly, to ensure a just transition to a carbon-free society and give power to the people.Meanwhile, a parliamentary petition is circulating, proposing an urgent sht to a ldquoWellbeing Economy that puts the health of people and planet first. ldquoTo deliver a sustainable and equitable recovery, it calls on the Treasury to ldquotarget social and environmental goals, rather than fixating on short-term profit and growth.These are the radical ideas we need.I recall the first time I truly grasped the urgency of the climate crisis ndash reading the opening pages of David Suzukis  book The Sacred Balance.

When you are not hungry because your countryrsquos wealth is being squandered.Tyranny, itrsquos ridiculous. So is the way we often speak about it. There are politicians who talk about our country as a one-party state.Thatrsquos Scotland, which isnrsquot even a state and which has a multi-party legislature, elected under a proportionate representation system literally designed to prevent unfair parliamentary majorities.There are also online activists who equate our free press and our public broadcasting to what is seen in places like Turkmenistan.These people: they are shallow they are trite and they are wrong, sickeningly so.There is an irony about the jokes about Berdi and the hyperbolic Twitter-grade rhetoric about one-party-state Scotland. It is that Mr Berdimuhamedovsrsquos corrupt autocracy is being enabled right here in the UK.Last week, the Sarajevo-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project or OCCRP ndash an international investigative journalism project ndash revealed some of the wealth of members of Mr Berdimuhamedovrsquos family and where it came from. The Scottish topline: our cottage industry providing shell firms was a big part of the story.Itrsquos a complicated tale, so please bear with me.People in Turkmenistan are hungry. The Central Asian state after the collapse of the Soviet Union depended on Russia buying its gas. In , Russia stopped doing so. The result  Hyperinflation that made food unaffordable.: Secret sanction-busting base - from a Scots council houseMr Berdimuhamedov in  signed a decree giving contracts to seven ldquoforeign companies to import staples like sugar, chicken and sunflower oil to be distributed to the public. The OCCRP this week revealed that two of these importers were Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs ndash a now notorious form of shell firm long exposed in this newspaper ndash and another was a English limited liability partnership.The shell firms, we can discover thanks to new UK transparency rules introduced after a campaign by The Herald, were controlled by Mr Berdimukamedovrsquos nephew, Hajymyrat Rejepov, or his associates.Mr Rejepov ndash who recently used Russian social media site Vkontakte to show off a seven-figure collection of luxury watches ndash did not comment when approached by OCCRP.One of the SLPs named was Staunchest Holdings, registered at a Mailboxes Etc in Church Street, Inverness. It had a monopoly on the import of frozen buffalo meat in to Turkmenistan and had a multi-million-pound state procurement contract under Mr Berdimukamedovrsquos food decree. The business, which was dissolved two months ago, officially listed a friend of Mr Rejepov as its person of signicant control or beneficial owner.: Scotlands a centre of launderingThere are virtual offices or PO Box addresses all over Scotland where hundreds of often opaquely owned shell companies are registered. Over the years The Herald has named many of them. Often the owners of the addresses have no idea who really controls the entities which they host. This business, like the related business of creating shell firms is entirely legal, but barely regulated.Autocrats and kleptocrats need such facilities to survive. A concerted effort in the UK and some other jurisdictions ndash often UK overseas territories ndash would make le very hard for Mr Berdimuhamedov and his ilk. Tens of billions have been flushed out of the former Soviet Union alone in the last three decades via British shell firms, especially Scottish ones. Despots and oligarchs also use British PR firms and British lawyers to make them look good. It is not just their money they are laundering, but their reputations too.This is usually considered a British Government problem. The Conservatives at Westminster have introduced some cautiously welcomed reforms and promise more. Critics accuse them of being half-hearted.But surely it is an ethical issue, not just a political one  Nobody is forcing Scottish people to create and host dodgy firms. Nobody is forcing Scottish lawyers or company formation agents to enable global criminality and oppression. But that is what they are doing, eventhey donrsquot know it.Politicians and the lobbies for white collar professions cannot pretend they do not know this. Because this enabling of corruption and crime is happening right on our high streets. The stink is right under our noses ndash evenwe do not smell it.There have never been free and fair elections in Turkmenistan. The country ranks close to the bottom of most league tables for democracy, transparency or press freedom.We had democratic elections last month. It was an opportunity for a whole range of small parties or independent candidates, some eccentric, some on one fringe or another, to try and have their say.These small outfits tend not have permanent HQs. So they use mail boxes. Often the very same ones as the suppliers of shell firms.Alex Salmondrsquos Alba party shares its virtual office HQ, in Edinburgh, with SLPs. So does George Gallowayrsquos AllUnity, whose official base opposite Ayr bus station is familiar to anyone who keeps up with opaque corporate strictures north of the border. The once proud now tiny Social Democratic Party is based at a mailbox in central Glasgow which entirely legally hosts SLPs linked to endless scandals.This is a meaningless coincidence, of course.

The operation was the arrest of two alleged traffickers, accused of conspiring to facilitate illegal immigration.People smugglers are ldquoTreating innocent lives as a commodity and lining their pockets while people are dying, Ms Patel is quoted as saying without any apparent sense of irony.Plenty of those who had been outraged did a quick volte face and expressed relief that the politician was on the side of right. Dont be so sure: successive governments hostile to immigration have helped create a thriving market for those looking to exploit people desperate to reach the UK.No mention was made of the victims of this type of situation either. No wonder. In January this year Home Office minister Victoria Atkins, the minister for safeguarding, rejected proposals in a parliamentary bill that were designed to provide additional supports for victims of trafficking. The bill, tabled by Tory le peer Ian McColl and co-sponsored by Iain Duncan Smith, asked for trafficking survivors to receive at least  months access to safe housing, support and protection from immigration detention.In response, Ms Atkins said, \"The government does not agree that victims should automatically be granted leave to remain for  months.\"Evenyou struggle to find empathy for victims and prefer a tough-on-crime approach, poorly supporting vulnerable people and then deporting them is a boon to criminals - youre packing off those who can testy to their crimes.Butwere looking for a coherent, humane strategy from Boris Johnsons government then well be staring at an endless blank horizon.\"Take back control of our borders\" was one of the most potent slogans of the pro-Brexit campaign. And yet, when it became vital to do just that, the Tories have spectacularly screwed it.Last year Ms Patel was having fun deploying RAF jets over the English Channel in response to refugees in rubber dinghies while also flying in fruit pickers from Eastern Europe to Pick For Britain because wed run out of migrants.There were reports this week of EU citizens being detained at UK airports and held in detention centres for as long as seven days. They claimed to have been denied medicines, such as blood pressure tablets and contraceptive pills needed to control polycystic oy syndrome.Today, a report from the Independent Monitoring Board details \"inhumane treatment\" of detainees held in Brook House, near Gatwick Airport. Volunteers engaged to scrutinise conditions in custody, found high levels of self-harm, suicidal ideation and serious delays in assessing torture claims.These stories are relentless. Every week, fresh outrage at the UKs inhumane immigration system. It feels never ending.While the Home Office displays relentless confused cruelty, when presented with a genuine, vital need to control the borders, the government failed to do so. Quarantine regulations were eye-poppingly lax. There was a failure to check that people were self-isolating - for the required time, or even at all. The information on how to quarantine was muddled and open to interpretation.And when overseas holidays were allowed, there was a push for people to travel without any real clarity on safety or caution.Now we have a travel traffic light system already being hammered by scientists as incomprehensible and picked apart by the opposition as unworkable. Is an airline consortium in about Boris Johnsons personal texts Last week hundreds gathered in Glasgow to help block the detention of foreign nationals. My colleague Kirsteen Paterson at The National had a vital follow up story about a second immigration raid on the same morning in the city at the same time local residents in Pollokshields stopped the removal of two of their Indian neighbours, mechanic Lakhvir Singh and chef Sumit Sehdev.This other raid went under the radar. While the demonstration on Kenmure Street made international headlines, no one saw the van that came for this other man at the emergency accommodation centre he had been placed in. No crowds gathered, no one lay holding the chassis underneath his van because this removal was unseen - as with others that have occurred this year and that will continue to occur.As Kirsteen Paterson highlights, on May  the UK signed a new deal with India, agreeing to accept  Indian students aged  to  to live and work in the UK for up to two years, the process of ing visa overstayers will be \"swter and more efficient\". The Home Office would not be drawn on whether the two dawn raids against three Indian men in Glasgow were carried out on the same day due to an intention to target Indian nationals as part of this deal.In the push to publicise friendly ties to India, Boris Johnson waited until the eleventh hour to cancel his scheduled trip to the country. Despite the concerns over the Indian iant, flights from Pakistan and Bangladesh were stopped yet in the three weeks following, , travellers from India were allowed to arrive in the UK.Was this lax approach influenced by the immigration deal with India  Was it influenced by a potential trade deal Were at another crucial point in lockdown easing. We were here last summer - cinemas opened, the government paid people to eat indoors, foreign travel restarted and folk shot off to sunny climes with a sigh of relief.Both governments urge personal responsibility, asking for caution in enjoying new found freedoms butrestrictions are eased, however, people will make the most of them - including overseas travel.It is folly to put any faith in the government to safely manage the borders for holidaymakers and travellers with regards coronavirus. It is glaringly apparent that the notion of taking back control of immigration means unfettered cruelty.For a government dead set against free movement, the virus has been allowed to wander untrammelled.

Except for the Range Rover, of course - the exception to every rule.

Therersquos no sleight of hand here, itrsquos simply the effect of not havingto pay the full cost of the car from the startinsteadyou only pay for the period from new until the end of your lease agreement. The remainder of the value is thenrealisedby the funder when they sell it into the used car marketplace.The result is that luxury cars are more affordable than you might believe. For example,the BMW  Series Saloon costs as little as pound a month to lease, which includes VAT, road tax and delivery. For those drivers desiring luxury but wanting to reduce the environmental impact of their driving, then there is always the plug-in electric hybrid version of the  Series, which can travelin excess of miles on the electric battery alone.Intelligent Car Leasing is aleasingprovider based in Glasgow that offers professionaladvice and assistance on how to lease the latest cars, and part of a group that recently received Investors in People Platinum status.Martin Brown, Managing Director of the company, says:ldquoRather than committing a lot of capital to purchase a car, with its monthly rental payments spread over anything from  months to  months, leasing is a more affordable way to drive a luxury car.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun. We had a whole night in Fjara filming and then down in St Ninianrsquos Isle and up in Eshaness. It was fascinating seeing how the filming is done.ldquoI hope the advert encourages people to come up to Shetland and enjoy all that it has to offer. Therersquos lots of opportunities to get outdoors, from cycling and paddle boarding to birdwatching and fishing. It really is an adventure playground.Although the finished project looks spectacular, the Shetland weather added an extra challenge for Burra-based film-maker Stephen Mercer.He shot the footage in April, during the cold snap that left snow lying on the ground for weeks. Mr Mercer said it was an interesting project and added that, frosty conditions aside, the ldquoamazing locations helped sell the destination.Promote Shetland is stressing the need for all visitors to exercise caution when travelling this year and has published guidance urging all tourists to take two lateral flow tests before making their journey.The project was supported by the STV Growth Fund and match-funding from Promote Shetland and Loganair...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3812694.jpg--.jpg?1621502297000\n","title":"church launches new youth app","story":" THE Presbyterian Church in Irelandhas sought to respond to the impact of the pandemic by supporting and developing congregational le across PCI’s -plus churches with a range of resources. The latest initiative is the brand new PCI Youth App.Rev David Thompson, Secretary to the Council for Congregational Le and Witness, explained that one of key elements of fruitful youth ministry is effective communication, which was challenging before Covid-, but has become even more so in present circumstances. The new app will allow congregations to safely and effectively keep in touch with young people, leaders and parents.”With a number of default ‘pages’, which can then be customised by congregations as their own ‘affiliate’ app, it brings everything together in one place, that is easily accessible to everyone involved in a church’s youth ministry. Congregations with less time and resources can start off with a basic template and build as their needs change, but others may want to be a little more adventurous, which makes it not just a useful tool for these times of additional challenge, but one that will continue to be useful long into the future.David Thompson explained that this makes the App very flexible, “As a Council, we were delighted to receive funding from Northern Ireland’s Education Authority to make the App freely available to  congregations and we have really been encouraged by its steady uptake by congregations. We hope that it will prove invaluable in effectively communicating not only what is happening, when and where, especially when our youth groups can’t meet in person.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3813137.jpg--.jpg?1621509111000\n","title":"moy park offer jab at work to employees","story":"Moy Park is facilitating its Northern Ireland workforce with the opportunity to receive the COVID- vaccination at work.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework.

This action is being taken as a precautionary measure in line with standard national guidance.”TB is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.It mainly affects the lungs, but it can impact on other parts of the body, including the stomach, glands, bones and nervous system.Although a serious condition, it can be curedtreated with the right antibiotics.Symptoms of TB include fever and night sweats, a persistent cough and unexplained weight loss.Dr Sarah Milligan, Acting Consultant in Health Protection, PHA, said: “TB is a serious but curable infectious disease which normally affects the lungs, but it can affect other parts of the body too. It is usually spread through the air when a patient coughs or sneezes. TB is a dficult infection to catch and usually requires prolonged close contact.”Dr Milligan continued: “I would like to reassure parents and those who attend the school that children with TB are rarely infectious to others and the risk to pupils and staff at the school is low. The screening that is being put in place is a precautionary measure.”Aileen Browne, Principal at St Matthew’s, said: “The school is cooperating with the Public Health Agency to help ensure the safety of the school community.

And for the first time since the turn of the year, some lucky fans will be there to see it. One thousand supporters of Larne and Linfield will be welcomed back for the Irish Cup final at Mourneview Park in Lurgan tonight. It has been a dramatic journey for the Larne fans, after a controversial semi-final win over Crusaders that saw Crues goalkeeper Jonny Tuffey red-carded in the penalty shoot out. The final will serve as a test event, with fans required to take Covid tests before and after the match while adhering to social distancing while watching the game. Some of the lucky ticket-holders told the Belfastof their excitement for the chance to watch a game — and see this season’s cup winners crowned — after months locked out of stadiums. On the Linfield side, Alex Harshawfrom Moira said he was overjoyed to watch a match in person. “I can’t wait to be honest, I’ve been watching all the matches on TV but it’s just not the same as being there,” he said. “It still won’t be the same as being at a final with , people, but any chance to be there I’ll take it. “I was going to go with my dad but he has health problems so wasn’t able to get to this one.” Fellow Linfield supporter Mark McGuigganfrom Lisburn said he would have preferred to face Crusaders in the final, but was relieved to have secured his ticket. “It’s a long time coming, it’s a long time since and there’s been a couple of embarrassments along the way,” he said. “But I’m glad I’ll be there and was lucky enough to get a ticket. It’s a strange thing to get a Covid test just to go to a football match but it’s all for a good enough cause at the moment.” Stuart Warrenfrom Antrim has his fingers crossed for another Linfield win. “It’s something you look forward to. I think the three Covid tests is a wee bit over the top, but as long as I get to see the match I’ll be happy enough,” he said. With bragging rights on the line, he added: “I could head down with a Larne fan that I work with but I just thought that wouldn’t be a good idea for the drive home.” Linfield fan David Hanthornefrom Coleraine has had both his vaccines and said he felt more than ready to get back to matches. “It’s brilliant being back at any event at all, just being able to get out and do something. Over the past year you’ve really not had anything to look forward to,” he said. “If both teams turn up like they can it’s going to be close. I’m obviously biased but I think - Linfield.” Cheering from the other end of Mourneview Park will be Margaret Fergusonfrom Larne, who will be making it a family affair by taking her two youngest sons Lucasand Caleb , who both serve as ballboys for Larne’s home games. “We’re extremely excited,” she said. “I’ve missed watching football so much … it’s something to lt everybody. We’re hoping to wave the first team off just after pm, then we’ll drive down. “It’s such a great thing for a mum with boys.” Josh Neillfrom Larne said it was “amazing” to be back cheering his team, evenhe has take multiple Covid tests. “If it helps get fans back in then it sounds good to me,” he said. “I’m happy enough to be in a crowd again. I’ve been at games before and it’s really spaced out and there’s no nonsense with the regulations.” Reliving the dramatic semi-final, he said: “I’ve been absolutely all over the place since. I’ve barely slept, it’s been an absolute blur. “I thinkI was on the Crusaders side of things I would be gutted, but obviously I’m delighted. “I’ve been watching Larne get beaten for too long so I’ll take what I can get.” Starved of watching matches for too long, Davy Wilson from Larnehas resorted to desperate measures in recent months. “A few of us have been going along with our ladders to games and we just find an appropriate spot to watch from behind the goal. “For our first away match we went into someone’s back garden and were able to see the pitch.” For someone so dedicated, taking a few Covid tests is a small price to pay. “I’m just happy that the doors are starting to open again,” Davy said. “It might put some people off but not me.

Mid and East Antrim has the lowest annual figure at , tonnes.These areas shipped .% and % of their waste outside Northern Ireland respectively.SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: The SDLP is strongly committed to the circular economy: treating our waste as much as possible as a resource for further reuse, rather than as material to be dumped or burnt.It is particularly worrying that so much of Northern Ireland#s waste is being sent to other places for disposal.Councils have to up their game, processing wastes in ways that maximise their reuse.We must all accept our responsibility in reducing, reusing and recycling. These statistics are not just embarrassing, they are disgraceful.My local council, Derry City and Strabane, has shown what can be done with its #New  You# service.This takes old items such as furniture and redundant computers, restoring them for new use.Much more could be done along these same lines and I urge consumers to think before they dump.Alliance’s John Blair, a member of Stormont#s DAERA committee, added: Whilst there is evidence we have achieved recycling targets, we are not maximising recycling and circular economy opportunities.He said his party#s Green New Deal plan highlights the urgent need for a review of the current waste management structures in Northern Ireland, including an audit of existing residual waste capacity for landfill and incineration.Exportation of waste is not without risks or controversy.Last December several tonnes of household waste from here ended up in the sea off the east coast of the US while on its way to an incinerator in Orrington, Maine.It had been part of a larger shipment sent by Co Down-based company Re-Gen, which has contracts with councils to collect and dispose of black bin waste.Two cubes of shredded waste fell off a ship when they were being unloaded at docks during a storm, one of which could not be recovered.A clean-up operation ensued for what was deemed a one-off, extremely unfortunate occurrence.Last month the Belfastrevealed tonnes of material left out by people for recycling is instead incinerated each year.In the year to March , % of all local household waste was burned.Of the , tonnes of recycling collected by the roadside, around % was rejected and sent for energy recovery, ie incineration.The news emerged following a Channel  Dispatches programme that revealed some councils in the UK recycle less than % of the waste householders put out in bins.Defending the % figure, Environment Minister Edwin Poots said it is signicantly lower than other parts of the UK, and my department is working closely with councils and delivery partners to improve this fu rther..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most Read‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldRoyal North of Ireland Yacht Club blamed as Ballyhalbert secretary avoids jail term over £k fraudThe other ‘green’ list: Where NI’s waste goesTaylor Swt Belfast ‘sightings’ sends social media into hystericsTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast PlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest Northern IrelandThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will TB case confirmed in east Belfast primary schoolTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong storyA visitor’s guide to the South Sandwich Islands, Stormont’s latest green-lit holiday destinationBelfastopinion poll: Leader ratings, party standings and popularity of Poots and Donaldson revealedLatestBrown bears euthanised at zoo after escaping enclosureBulletproof cancelled by Sky following Noel Clarke allegationsThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will In pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenBBC director-general says staff feel ‘deeply let down’ by Dyson report findings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most Read‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenRoyal North of Ireland Yacht Club blamed as Ballyhalbert secretary avoids jail term over £k fraudThe other ‘green’ list: Where NI’s waste goesAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong storyTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast PlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteeLatest NewsBrown bears euthanised at zoo after escaping enclosureThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will BBC director-general says staff feel ‘deeply let down’ by Dyson report findingsActor Danny Masterson must stand trial on three rape chargesHeathrow to open dedicated arrivals facility for red list travellersLatestBrown bears euthanised at zoo after escaping enclosureBulletproof cancelled by Sky following Noel Clarke allegationsThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will In pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenBBC director-general says staff feel ‘deeply let down’ by Dyson report findings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A young girl and two women were injured.“I try not to show any worry or stress, because that would make the nurses and mothers worry as well.“I try to explain what they will experience — but most of these children don’t have sirens and bomb shelters at home.”She added: “Our staff works hard to make sure everybody is okay. It’s dficult for them. The mothers from Gaza are naturally concerned about their families there.”In the early nights of the conflict everyone involved with Sach slept in the building’s air raid shelter as Holon, south of Tel Aviv, was in the line of fire.Laura volunteered for Sach, which is a non-profit organisation funded by Israel, after her own son was old enough to attend nursery school.She works at the Edith Wolfson Medical Centre — the Sach headquarters — which, apart from administrative offices, is also a temporary home for  children, mothers, nurses and medical professionals.“At the moment, the patients from Gaza can’t go home,” said Laura, who has been the humanitarian charity’s ‘house mother’ since .“It’s an extremely dficult and sad situation. Let’s hope it comes to an end soon and everyone is able to go about their normal daily lives once again.”Sach, which offers free treatment primarily to children from developing countries who suffer from heart disease and cannot get adequate medical care at home, was founded in .It doesn’t treat Israeli children, who benefit from health insurance and receive excellent medical care in other hospitals.Of the Gazan children currently being looked after, one is an infant, another  months old and a third six years old.Two are accompanied by their mothers and another by a grandmother.Other Muslim patients include a -year-old from Kosovo and a one-year-old and six-year-old from Zanzibar.The staff helped the Muslim youngsters celebrate Ramadan, the month of Islamic fasting, which ended on May .Laura said there were three important words that the children — who are never segregated — understand.‘Kula’ and ‘kulala’ mean ‘eat’ and ‘rest’ respectively in Swahili, while ‘balagan’ is Hebrew for ‘chaos’ or ‘mess’.“The job got so much easier after we moved into a purpose-built centre  years ago,” said Laura, who’s multi-lingual.“We normally have up to  children at one time here in the house.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most Read‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldRoyal North of Ireland Yacht Club blamed as Ballyhalbert secretary avoids jail term over £k fraudThe other ‘green’ list: Where NI’s waste goesTaylor Swt Belfast ‘sightings’ sends social media into hystericsTop VideosPlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast Play#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastLatest WorldActor Danny Masterson must stand trial on three rape chargesHandwritten example of famous Einstein equation fetches . million dollarsFugitive Belgian extremist soldier evades massive manhuntMinnesota AG to prosecute police officer over shooting death of black manCook: Apple control over app store is to keep it simple and safe for customersLatestThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will In pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenBBC director-general says staff feel ‘deeply let down’ by Dyson report findingsActor Danny Masterson must stand trial on three rape chargesShane Lowry shakes off beach expedition to stay in touch at Kiawah Island,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She didn’t know how to live without alcohol. It was used as a coping mechanism to suppress underlying trauma. But, she says, after reaching out to addiction support group Heal the Hurt , her recovery has been ‘astounding’. “Heal the Hurt has helped me to realise that childhood trauma was not my fault, to face my past and see it as the past, not my today. googletag.cmd.push “With the help of group therapy in a safe environment of discussion and no judgements I slowly started believing in myself again with the help and power of the  steps to recovery.” She adds: “I now have a new thinking process, I had to relearn a lot of things that I thought were true about me and I see now that I was sick and trying to get better.” The woman, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid destabilising her recovery, says she had to confront her own ‘selfishness’ the ‘hurt and trauma’ that was being passed on to the next generation. googletag.cmd.push Breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse was key, she says, to ensure that her children and grandchildren never know that pain. She is proud to have climbed that mountain: “Those were my wildest dreams that I thought I would never achieve and now I am with the help of Heal the Hurt. “It’s amazing for everyone, especially my children. They got their mammy back and I got to be their true, amazing mammy again and their world. “I do my best not to judge or be judged, it’s all part of my recovery.” At group sessions she now leads by example by helping others to ‘see the beauty of not being a slave to addiction - to see the beauty in the world, not the darkness.’     DEVASTATED FAMILIES HTH founder, Liam Stewart, himself a recovering addict, says the addiction charity has gone from ‘strength to strength’ despite dficulties posed by the pandemic. Numbers attending have almost doubled. Last year the NI health service recorded over . million anti-depressant prescription items at a cost of over poundm. Mr Stewart points to the amount spent on anti-depressants in Northern Ireland as evidence of the need to address a mounting mental health crisis. While anti-depressants aren’t specically categorised as addictive, abuse of other types of prescription medication locally is of great concern to the Derry man. He says: “People were forced to stay at home over the past year where they drank more than usual to cope with the stress. “Their medication seemed to increase and it’s understandable that a lot of people crossed the line and are now in addiction.” Alcohol misuse alone costs Northern Ireland as much as pound million a year, with up to pound million of this falling on an already stretched Health and Social Care sector. Despite these signicant costs, the Department of Health allocates a relatively small budget to tackling the problem - pound million for implementation of its Drugs and Alcohol strategy, and a further pound million for statutory addiction services from the mental health budget. That represents around five per cent of the budget, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency . Derry and Belfast have the highest mortality rates related to alcohol mis-use in the North. Speaking candidly, Mr Stewart explains: “The depths of addiction in our very own group has claimed the lives of  people, the youngest being only  – families that are devastated forever. “Our referrals have doubled since July last year with the impact of Covid. “I believe Heal the Hurt has been a leline to many people, where there’s no appointment needed and people are made very welcome. Our service is also free of charge.” SMILES Underlining that point, another member of Heal the Hurt shared their experience with the Derry News. As a parent to three boys, he had attended with his GP and other health professionals but felt that ‘no-one understood’. He fell deeper into a hole of alcohol and drug abuse before finding the motivation to attend Heal the Hurt on the recommendation of a friend. While anxious at first, he grew more comfortable as other people recounted experiences similar to his own. “I decided to give the programme a go, today I am in recovery. “I never thought I could imagine a le without drink and drugs, yet here I am today, focussing on what’s really important, understanding it’s all about giving back, it’s about my boys and family.” He concludes: “My actions today are having an impact on my three boys and family. I used to bring only tears to my family, now today, I bring smiles. “Is it hard  Of course it is, it’s tough, but looking at my children and family smiling now is what’s important. “This makes me hungry for more of this programme and more of Heal the Hurt.” Meetings are currently held in a small room at the back of Northside Shopping Centre in Galliagh. Since it was established, Heal the Hurt’s path has not been straightforward, it has faced the threat of closure on more than one occasion. However, Mr Stewart expressed his gratitude to the local community for their ‘generous donations’ which have allowed the doors to remain open.  Group member, Brandon McManus , is the latest to kindly donate pound. “These people are saving lives and reuniting families. That’s priceless,” Mr Stewart says. Special mention was given to the Friars of Renewal for their input over the past five years, particularly Brother Patrick, who Mr Stewart described as one of his best friends. Brother Patrick is now living in New York where he is continuing to help people with addiction.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The seven-acre site at Bay Road faces onto the River Foyle. The site has long been used as a fuel depot. However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet. The sale of the Bay Road site is being managed by TDK Commerical Property Consultants.

The site benefits from  large warehouses, office building and a large covered storage area. “It has roughly  m of frontage on-to the River Foyle and this could be extended up the Pennyburn Inlet by around m.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this article, her family pay tribute to her.  ----------------------  It was with great sorrow and disbelief that we heard of the passing of Sandra Coyle. Sandra was to one as she was to all, a lovely happy always smiling bubbly girl. Sandra was married to her husband Jim for  years and together they had three children, Stephen, Maoliosa and Calvin. Sandra was first and foremost a devoted family woman and she will be sorely missed by them all. Sandra believed thatyou want something then you work for it and Sandra worked all of her adult le. She loved her many holidays whether it was heading to the sun or a weekend in Donegal. googletag.cmd.push Without doubt, her most cherished holiday was the one to Gracelands in Memphis to the love of her le Elvis. He was the only rival Jim had, but dont tell Jim, she would say. Sandra worked for  years in Foyle College kitchen, a job she loved. She often said, Jim took the children to school and she fed them. Jim is a driver with Ulsterbus. At Foyle, Sandra made many lelong friends and enjoyed many nights out with them. The sad news of her passing totally devastated them and they gave her a beautul guard of honour at her funeral. googletag.cmd.push Music and dancing were always a very important of Sandras le. She was a s and s child and loved the music from that era. Sandra took part in the Strictly Come Dancing shows with Jim to help raise money for the Foyle Hospice. This became a great source of pride for Sandra. The Ulsterbus dinner dance was another important date on her calendar. She hit two birds with one stone with this one weekend away and some great dancing. Sandra, of course, was a legend to her children, there was nothing she wouldnt got through for them. Sandra held birthday parties for them every year even though they were ,  and .     Sandra first got cancer in  and beat it. She had a year and a half free of it before it came back in October . This time it was in her breast and lungs. Sandra was a fighter and never gave in. She so wanted to beat it again but unfortunately it became too aggressive with infections and the load was too much to beat. It was only right that Sandra passed away quietly and peacefully surrounded by her loving family. The only way we can describe Sandra is by saying she was as beautul on the inside as she was on the outside. The world is a sadder place for Sandra not being in it. God rest you Sandra.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kick off :pm. Ruaidhri Higgins has had to plan without both players with both serving a one-game suspension with striker Parkhouse receiving his fth yellow card at Shamrock Rovers last week, while Lafferty was sent off at Tallaght. City’s away form has improved considerably in the short time with Higgins in charge, with City picking up seven points from Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Rovers. They now face a Waterford side who have been badly affected by Covid- in recent weeks, playing a reserve side in a - drubbing against Drogheda United, before being unable to field against Sligo Rovers. Waterford are currently bottom of the Premier Division, but Higgins is expecting a stern challenge. googletag.cmd.push “They have had a good period of not playing any games so they will be well rested and they have had a lot of time to prepare for this game,” he said. “They’ll be nice and fresh for this game and they will have had a lot of time to analyse us and analyse our strengths and weaknesses. There is a new manager coming in as well so you would expect a reaction from the players.” City though are confident after holding the champions to a - draw last week, a game they could well have won but for a very controversial equaliser to stand. googletag.cmd.push “Our away form has been very, very good against three of the top teams in the country we’ve taken seven points so it just shows that there are strong characters in this group and good players as well,” Higgins said. “We’ve set a standard on Saturday and we have to maintain that. We have to follow up on the performance against Shamrock Rovers and back it up with another good performance. Disappointed Meanwhile, Derry City fans hoping to attend this Monday’s game against St. Patrick’s Athletic have been left disappointed. The club released a statement yesterday explaining that despite recent changes by the Northern Ireland Executive, it was still too soon to allow supporters back into the Brandywell.     “Based on the current high rates of covid- transmission in the city, the Medical Director at the PHA has recommended that supporters should not be permitted to attend at this time,” it read. “In the interest of the health and safety of supporters, players and staff it has been agreed therefore that Monday nights match should remain behind closed doors. “We will continue to discuss a way forward with the relevant public authorities and will keep supporters informed of progress.” The club have also confirmed that Manchester City youngster Joe Hodge will not be ing to the club following an injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The young defender scored after just three minutes at the RSC, heading in a Will Patching free kick from close range, and that proved to be enough for the Candystripes. City were completely dominant in the first half, but it was a dferent story in the second half, although Waterford ultimately lacked the quality to take any of the half chances which came their way. It took just three minutes for Derry City to take the lead, doing so with their first attack. Goalkeeper Brian Murphy needlessly raced from his area and fouled James Akintunde in the corner, gting the visitors a free kick. Patching delivered the ball into the near post where Boyce rose to head in the opening goal from close range. googletag.cmd.push The Candystripes dominated the opening stages of the game and it should have been - on  minutes when Patching ran at the Waterford defence before curling an effort at goal which Murphy could only parry straight into the path of Akintunde. The forward opted not to shoot first time however, trying to take it around the goalkeeper, but Murphy did enough to turn Akintunde away from the goal and the chance was gone. It took Waterford  minutes before they tested Nathan Gartside at the other end, and it was a big moment in the first half as the Derry goalkeeper was at his best to keep out Shane Grfin’s free kick from  yards. Grfin, who scored from a similar position earlier in the season at the Brandywell, tried his luck again, but this time Gartside was equal, ing to his right to push the ball behind for a corner. googletag.cmd.push Waterford were much livelier at the start of the second half and they could have gone level when Jamie Mascoll’s cross picked out Adam O’Reilly completely unmarked in the area, but he got his header all wrong and failed to even test Gartside. City did not enjoy anywhere near the same dominance in the second half, as Waterford played a high pressing game, which made the players in red and white very uncomfortable. They were very early caught out by a Mascell free kick on  minutes, as John Martin crept free to the back post, but he was unable to bring the ball under control and the chance was again gone.     That was as good as it got through for the home side as Derry head out to pick up a valuable three points away from home.  Teams Waterford: Brian Murphy, Darragh Power, Cameron Evans, Josh Collins, Shane Grfin, Adam O’Reilly, James Waite, John Martin, Niall O’Keefe, Jamie Mascoll, Eric Molloy .

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was as though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Ardglass.jpg","title":"Ardglass fishermen sign up to marine litter project  ","story":"A NEW initiative has been launched which aims to reduce the amount of litter in the sea.Spearheaded by the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, a number of trawler owners based in Ardglass have signed up for the new lsquoFishing for Litterrsquo scheme designed to help protect marine le.The village hosted a launch of the new scheme with trawler skippers and Fishery Harbour Authority officials last Friday and were joined by representatives from the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Association.The lsquofishing for litterrsquo scheme is designed to reduce the amount of marine litter by physically removing it, with the new initiative also highlighting the importance of good waste management amongst the fleet.Participating vessels are given hardwearing bags to collect marine litter that is caught in their nets during their normal fishing activities, with the waste subsequently deposited at participating harbours on the quayside where they are moved to a dedicated skip for recycling or disposal which has a positive impact on the environment.The scheme is being launched at the three Co Down ports of Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel with fishermen highlighting their frustration about marine litter which can be found in rivers, lakes and seas across the globe.A walk along any coastline will reveal a rainbow of colour where there should just be sand and stones with plastic the real reason that marine litter is such a big issue.Jenny Lau mdash the Fishery Harbour Authorityrsquos environment officer who was in Ardglass last Friday mdash explained that a plastic bottle is typically used for less than  minutes before being discarded, after which it takes  years to break down.ldquoEven then, it will break down into smaller and smaller pieces known as micro plastics which are still harmful. This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That which was a major cause of the Troubles is also problematic in Israel. After all,the majority takes its own decisions by majority vote, then just as a half of a half is a quarter, so too, a majority of a majority is probably a minority: the DUP in Belfast, the Boris Johnson wing of the Tories, and so on. True majority rule can only exist with consensus. In practice,no party gets a majority of seats in Parliament, the biggest can ‘jump into bed’ with another and, as long as the two thus add up to at least % + , that pair can then rule.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

While it is welcome that he is now calling on Brussels to compromise, having previously, like Leo Varadkar, talked asIreland is the EU’s most rigorous enforcer of the single market, this new flexibility is also misleading.It means modications to the protocol or extensions of grace periods or easing of checks. Prominent unionist critics of the Irish Sea border are often seeming to accept that such modications are acceptable. But it would mean, in essence, that the UK’s repeal of Article  of the Act of Union, which relates to unfettered internal trade within the Union, will continue. But that repeal just won’t be so visible or obvious.That is unacceptable because it will still mean major constitutional change. It is an outcome with which Irish republicans will be delighted: Article  will have been repealed, but the fundamental nature of the change will not be so apparent.Nationalist Ireland fiercely rejected the reverse. Eventhe new trade ergence began at the existing land frontier between the two jurisdictions, as it should, and eventhe UK vowed to have no checks, Dublin simply would not accept it.Why  Because nationalism rejected the premise.Checks were not the issue. Modications or grace periods would have been insufficient to placate Ireland in such circumstances. As you would expect them to be to unionists now such a scenario is panning out in the Irish Sea.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately, both Sean and his father were thrown from the kayak into the freezing cold water.Sean’s father was washed ashore and despite frantic efforts he was unable to reach his son who was stuck in the water against a wall at the opposite bank. Thankfully a local father and son - Mike Greerand his -year-old son Zachery - were able to pull Sean safely out of the water and alert the emergency services. ]]Due to the severity of the incident, the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , flown by Air Ambulance Northern Ireland were tasked to the scene along with a number of emergency first response teams.Fortunately Sean has recovered well and as a result of his experience he wanted to do something positive that would potentially help another person who might need the air ambulance in future.Sean’s mum Elaine said, “We wanted to do something that would give back. Air Ambulance NI is a wonderful service that we cannot take for granted. “The service has been tasked to our council area  times in  and it can only help people with donations to support its sustainability. We are so thankful that Sean wanted to do something and that’s him, he has so much grit and determination and we are so proud of him.”Just two months after Sean’s ordeal in the water, both he and his father took on the mighty challenge of summitting Northern Ireland’s highest peak, Slieve Donard to raise funds for the lesaving service. The seven-year-old initially set himself the goal of raising £ but was overwhelmed when his final total came in at £,! His mum said, “Sean is so grateful to every single person who donated to his Just Giving page and helped him smash his target. If the money pays half the fuel or pays towards saving somebody ’s le, it will have been worth it. “Every step Sean took on that mountain really was to help ensure someone  got pre-hospital critical carethey needed it - every penny donated will help that cause.”At the beginning of May, Sean and his family were delighted to be one of the first patient families to visit the air ambulance base with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Sean was delighted to get a tour of the airbase and hear all about how his donation will help others who are potentially in le threatening situations. Mum Elaine commented, “Sean has not stopped talking about his visit to see the air ambulance. He also signed up as a Junior Club member with the charity and so was delighted to wear his branded lanyard and bring along his teddy to get his photo by the helicopter. “He was given a tour, had lots of questions answered and was delighted to hear more about the pilot’s role within the team, as this is something he’s really interested in. “He was also given a copy of the charity newsletter and hasn’t put it down - that’s really helping him with his reading too! We are just so delighted that something that could have turned out to be a devastating situation has had such a positive outcome and we are extremely proud of our young boy who is a big air ambulance fan!”The charity Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, provides the HEMS for Northern Ireland. The service brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes.How we reported Sean’s rescue in February - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
