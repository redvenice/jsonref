It is a basic existence. We work all the hours that God sends because we have to.\u0027We do not understand things about saving the planet or what is or is not organic. For us it is all about work and survival.\u0027         Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong KongMrs Regar\u0027s husband Ram Gopal also works at Nayika where his duties include cutting the organic cotton for the blanket Archie was wrapped in. As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176).The couple start work at 9.30am and finish at 5.30pm, six days per week. They are only given 25 minutes for lunch and are not provided with any formal contracts.Their salaries may seem low by western standards but in Mr Gopal\u0027s case, he earns above the national average monthly salary of 13,000 rupees (£154). His wife however falls below this threshold meaning their combined income is barely enough for a family of eight. Neither of their sons are in full-time employment and have just started their own hand printing business from home. The family survives on a mainly vegetarian diet of rice, lentils and vegetables, which have increased in price in recent times. A kilo of lentils, for example, can cost anything up to 200 rupees (£2.37) while most vegetables are less than half that. The average price of a bottle of beer is also 200 rupees.Mr Gopal, aged 55, said: \u0027Even though by Indian standards my salary is just above average as a family, if you combine our income, we are poor and things are very hard. We do not know about the world of the rich and famous who buy the things we make. We do not even know which countries it is being sent to. \u0027My job is very demanding and requires a lot of skill but it is not very well paid. Sadly, it is all I know, this is the only thing that I\u0027ve done all my life.\u0027When shown a picture of Meghan holding baby Archie in the blanket he helped make, Mr Gopal beamed with pride. He added: \u0027I do not know who these people are but we had heard that somebody very famous was using our dohar. This must be them.

I might be poor but I feel very proud that royal people are using this blanket.\u0027When MailOnline visited the Nayika factory, workers were busy hand block printing reams of organic cotton which form the outer layers of the dohar. These are then stuffed with mulmul, fine, soft cotton and then stitched to complete the blanket. Since Meghan appeared in public with Archie wrapped in it, orders have gone through the roof and around 2,000 are currently being made to meet demand. The hand-crafted blanket has sold out on the Malabar Baby website and is available for pre-order only. It is described as being \u0027simple but chic,\u0027 and makes \u0027cuddle time lots of fun at home or on the go.\u0027Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry. Workers are paid a fixed monthly salary, as opposed to each item they make, child labour is strictly forbidden and there is a high level of cleanliness. While concerns have been raised over salaries, employees describe the management as \u0027fair.\u0027         Conditions at the factory are better than at many within the Indian textile industry.

But we are delighted that the Royal family of Great Britain are using something that we have made.

We do not set them.\u0027Our workers enjoy good conditions, much better than you\u0027ll find at other factories. We pay them the correct rate and treat them well.\u0027Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American businesswoman Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong Kong. She came up with the idea after being unable to find baby wear and accessories that she felt were affordable and of high quality.She named the company after the exclusive area of Mumbai where he family lives.During a visit to the Nayika factor earlier this year, Anjali posted a photograph of herself with Mrs Regar on social media to celebrate International Women\u0027s Day but incorrectly called her Anita. Malabar Baby has been approached by MailOnline for a response. "},{"url":null,"title":"Jack Grealish Connor Wickham separate bust ups revellers exclusive London club","story":"Share this article          It is not known what started the altercation but police confirmed they did not attend the scene         In the photographs, Grealish can be seen remonstrating at someone while other revellers look onA witness said he saw the Crystal Palace striker leave the club when another reveller said something to him \u0027out of the blue\u0027 which kicked off the scrap.Both players had been involved in pre-season matches on Saturday with Wickham scoring past Bristol City and Grealish assisting two against Charlton Athletic. It is not the first time that Jack Grealish has come under the spotlight for his off-the-field antics.The talented star, who has often been linked with big-money moves to top clubs, was pictured passed out drunk in Tenerife in 2015.

The money lost on the annex meant she had to be put in a care home.                The Elmhurst family paid £43,200 for Hudson Garden Rooms to build this annex for their mother Carolyn to live in. They have since gone bust and left them £37,500 out of pocket            Holly Elmhurst, 49 (left) enlisted Hudson Garden Rooms to build a four-room annex in her sister Samantha\u0027s (right) garden for her mother Carolyn Lerski, 76 (pictured) to live inMs Elmhurst, who claims surveyors have told her fixing the build will cost a further £37,500, said: \u0027They said they could build exactly what my mother wanted, and have the work done in three months.\u0027But they didn\u0027t put proper drains in, the guttering just hangs over the garden, the floor wasn\u0027t finished, the ceiling is damp on it.\u0027We had to pay someone else to fit some decking so my mum could walk inside the property.\u0027The property is unlivable, and now mum has had to live in a care home.\u0027Ms Elmhurst\u0027s sister Samantha, 51, has also been fighting to have the problem resolved.She said: \u0027The company director has never set foot in this place since the first day and didn\u0027t even check what his workers had done.\u0027My mum had a brain aneurysm in 2016 whilst build was happening, which led to dementia and her being bound to a wheelchair.\u0027           Building work on the garden annex (pictured) stopped after three months and they later found the company had gone bust            Inside the garden lodge the ceilings were damp, lighting fittings not attached properly and door frames wonky Single mother-of-two Carolyn moved out of her previous rented accommodation in Norwich so she could be closer to her family but thought the annex was the perfect solution to maintain some independence.Holly claims she and her family began to notice problems with the build soon after it work started, with construction halting completely in July 2016.They claim the outbuilding has no ventilation system, foul water drainage, partly un-insulated floors, doors and windows that do not meet fire safety rules, damp staining on the ceiling after an un-insulated water pipe froze and burst and water pipes which were installed halfway up the side of the house rather than being buried.They were forced to spend thousands on legal fees and claim surveyors told them it will cost a further £37,500 to repair the errors.            Damp marks soon appeared on the ceiling of the four-room annex in Norwich            Work was unfinished on the kitchen (pictured) leaving the family battling a court case But they also insist they can\u0027t get any money back now the company has gone bust.  Samantha said: \u0027The company liquidated itself despite owing £400,000 to creditors - this information can be found on Companies House.\u0027It\u0027s awful they\u0027re still able to do this. The way all of us have been treated has been dreadful.\u0027The unacceptable and ugly soil and water pipes that Hudsons \u0027draped\u0027 around our patio area are a constant reminder of their shoddy work.\u0027When you think about what has happened too much, it\u0027s just awful.\u0027Holly has since set up a JustGiving account to try and recuperate her mum\u0027s lost money and pay for alternative retirement care.            Since the botched building job Mrs Lerski has had a brain aneurysm and been diagnosed with dementia            The money lost on the annex (pictured) meant she (pictured in a wheelchair with daughters Holly and Samantha) had to be put in a care home"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/29/18/16641038-0-image-a-6_1564420154735.jpg","title":"Google camp guests Harry Styles Katy Perry Orlando Bloom Leonardo DiCaprio Bradley Cooper","story":"Copy Katy in a floral jumpsuit by Faithfull The BrandShop similar at NET-A-PORTERKaty Perry is living it up in Ibiza and of course, the singer was looking her usual stylish self as she enjoyed her holiday.Like many other A-listers, it seems Katy has fallen for the charms of fashion-pack favourite label, Faithfull The Brand.

I hope it’s going to be a vintage year. But still: it isn’t as long as our longlist.This year, a mighty 172 books have been nominated for the Not the Booker prize. That’s an impressive indication of the scale of publishing in English-language fiction and of the enthusiasm you guys have for reading. But now, it’s time to start talking about how good some of these books are. To do that, we need to produce our shortlist.The first part of that process is to whittle down 163 books to a far more manageable three, which we will then add to three more – one selected by last year’s judges and one from each of our two nominated book champions for this year, Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh.And when I say “we”, I really mean “you”. This is part of the competition that you control, because it’s your vote that will help decide which three books go forward into the next round.Voting is easy – or it will be if you read the following instructions carefully:In order for your vote to be counted and comply with our all killer, no filler terms and conditions, you need to choose two books from the longlist below, from two different publishers, and accompany those choices with a short review of at least one of your chosen books.

Now, some writers are losing faith in ‘the Mike Pence rule’Joshua Harris was just 22 in 1997 when he published I Kissed Dating Goodbye, a dating guidebook for young Christians that advised them to do anything but. Dating was a “training ground for orce”, he argued in the book, which sold almost 1m copies worldwide. It also made Harris a superstar in the Christian purity movement, a pro-abstinence crusade that began in evangelical churches in the 1990s and became well-known in the purity ring-wearing hands of Jessica Simpson and the Jonas Brothers. Many authors came after Harris – John and Stasi Eldredge, Hayley DiMarco, Tim and Beverly LaHaye – all of them in the US, where religious publishing is worth $1.22bn (£1bn) a year.Now 44, Harris made headlines this week when he revealed he no longer considers himself a Christian. He has been issuing apologies for his own books over the last decade, even making a documentary called I Survived Kissing Dating Goodbye. On his Instagram this week, he wrote: “I have lived in repentance for the past several years – repenting of my self-righteousness, my fear-based approach to life, the teaching of my books, my views of women in the church, and my approach to parenting to name a few.”Dianna E Anderson, who left the purity movement in her 20s and is the author of Damaged Goods: New Perspectives on Christian Purity, says its relationship guides have inflicted lasting damage on young people desperate to preserve their holiness while battling hormones.“As a woman, I was taught that women don’t feel or experience desire, so I suppressed any and all thoughts along that way, to the point where I was practically asexual all the way up until I was 23, and I didn’t date until I was 25,” she says. “Turns out it’s really hard to date when you’re a super-repressed purity-obsessed evangelical.”Most Christian purity guidebooks dish out similar advice. The golden rule: no sex before marriage, ever. The relationships are always heterosexual and monogamous, while the sex is always deeply conventional – a mindset that has left a generation of Christian teens muddled on the “purity” of acts like oral sex, and inspired the Garfunkel and Oates tune The Loophole.Anderson still lives with the after-effects of being raised on such ideas. As a teenager, she believed that women didn’t feel arousal and men were uncontrollable, which “caused me to imagine that losing my virginity would essentially be rape. That if I wasn’t married, then the only other way I would lose my purity would be if I wasn’t strong enough and a date raped me. Of course, I didn’t see it as rape – I saw it as a man being animalistic and just giving in to his sin. I had no mechanism for understanding that I could possibly consent, and that it would be something I would want to do. In my teenage, evangelical imagination, I hoped and prayed to be put in a scary sexual assault situation so that I could prove how faithful I was to God.”Harris is now leaving his wife after 21 years of marriage. Anderson says disillusionment is not uncommon in a movement built on the fallacy that if you marry young and abstain, you’ll be happy. But she does not think others will follow Harris’s lead, as criticism tends to make them double down on their beliefs. “You see this throughout the Southern Baptist Convention, and through the abuse scandals at Harris’s former denomination, Sovereign Grace Ministries. They refuse to acknowledge that a sexual ethic based simply on telling women they have to say no until they’re married, at which point they cannot say no any more, is flawed.”For many like Anderson, Harris’s apology is too late, having spawned a whole subgenre of books by authors who won’t also recognise the damage they have done.“I don’t think evangelicals should be contributing to the conversation about purity and sex anymore. It’s time for them to listen,” she says. “As a queer woman, I was so repressed that I didn’t discover my own queer identity until I was in my late 20s, and I feel like important parts of myself were stolen from me because of this theology. At this point, it’s their job to listen. Unfortunately, they don’t seem ready to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99bb6296b91f741f06e0c60e322519784a3ad845/0_294_5036_3021/master/5036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=084903478b4240a390ca43ebd04fb85a","title":"pound holidays prices sterling brexit","story":"Sterling’s Brexit-driven plunge could make imported goods more expensiveFears of a no-deal Brexit have sent the pound plunging this week, with currency markets more alarmed than at any time since the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum.When the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told BBC Radio 4 on Monday morning that “We must be prepared to give the country the finality it needs, to prepare businesses and people more broadly”, currency traders immediately began marking down the pound.“It appears we are finally seeing the potential repercussions of the UK leaving without a deal,” said currency traders Clear Treasury.What does this mean for you? The immediate impact is on holidaymakers heading to Spain and other destinations in the EU, but a collapse in the currency also has much wider implications for household finances.It’s grim, with rates on offer far worse than the “market”’ rates that traders talk about. At some UK airports, the pound is already worth less than a euro, and the same as a dollar.For example, at Heathrow, customers walking up to Travelex desks on Tuesday morning were being given just €0.91 for each £1, while if they wanted dollars the rate had collapsed to just $1.01.But sensible travellers know to buy their currency in advance online, avoiding the airport bureaux. Travelex is currently giving online customers €1.063 and $1.184 respectively for each £1.Parity with the euro no longer looks unlikely, and history tells us once the currency trapdoor opens, the falls can be painful sterling sank to near parity with the dollar in the mid-1980s, although only for a brief period.Prices of imported goods in the shops – and that’s an awful lot of what we consume as a country – will have to rise. You know those price tags on clothes in Zara, in euros, sterling and other currencies? It won’t be long before they are adjusted again, with the price in sterling inevitably having to rise. There is a lag effect here – so the rise won’t be immediate, but it will flow through eventually.Yes, tourists are the winners – just not British ones.

But is it achievable?The Champs Élysées is one of the most famous streets in the world, but you could say the French were beaten to it by the Mughals. About 15 years before the avenue was laid out in 1667 in Paris, India’s Mughal emperor Shah Jehan built a grand mile-long street in his capital to reflect the glory of the empire at its height.It ran from Fatehpuri mosque at one end to the colossal Red Fort at the other and was lined with trees, elegant mansions, mosques and gardens. Provisions for the Red Fort, the imperial residence, were carried down the boulevard by elephants, camels and horse-drawn carriages.In the centre ran the clear waters of a canal, reflecting the moonlight, or chandni – giving the street its name, Chandni Chowk (chowk means open market space). On hot summer evenings, the Bishti, a tribe of water carriers, would sprinkle water from their goat-hide canteens to cool the street.But while the Champs Élysées has retained its grandeur, Chandi Chowk and the area around it have degenerated into a mess of heaving crowds, dense traffic, decrepit buildings, pavements taken over by hawkers, tangled overhead electrical wires and general mayhem. The area known as the Walled City, or Old Delhi, is probably the most congested place in India.In a cool, tranquil studio in Aya Nagar, far away from the chaos, an architect is working to restore the Mughal splendour of Chandni Chowk. Pradeep Sachdeva’s firm, commissioned by the Delhi government, began work in December. The area has already been dug up and work is under way in an effort to meet the January 2020 completion date.On his computer screen is an image of how it will look. The most striking feature is the absence of cars. His design shows a calm street lined with trees, benches and lights, with wide pavements on either side of a green central lane. The electrical and telecom cables and water lines are buried underground.Since this is one of the busiest market areas in India (the Khari Baoli spice market by Fatehpuri mosque is Asia’s oldest), vehicles have to be allowed in to unload goods – but this will be restricted to the early hours of the morning.“This is one of the most important street designs in the world because few streets are this old and few embody so much urban complexity,” says Sachdeva. “It represents all that is complex about urban India and if we get the transformation right it will become an example for hundreds of such precincts across the country.”He says western designs don’t work in India because they lack the cycle rickshaws, the street hawkers and the high density of people.One of the first decisions he made was to not recreate the canal. “We know from our other projects that we can’t look after bodies of water in India. They get full of waste. So we have symbolised the canal by placing water-like patterns in the central median.”Another tricky decision was where to place public toilets and police kiosks. He settled on placing them in the central strip, rather than on the footpaths where they would have been an obstruction.Sachdeva is acutely aware of how important the redevelopment of Chandi Chowk is for the residents of Old Delhi, the historic old quarter where the majority of residents are Muslim. For decades, they have felt neglected by the authorities who seemed to care more for other areas of the capital over the of part which, ironically, boasts all the heritage.Over the years, affluent Hindu families fed up with the congestion and pollution vacated their havelis – mansions featuring a courtyard, fluted columns and doors high enough for elephants to enter – and moved to modern houses in south Delhi.Many Muslim residents, emotionally attached to the Walled City and its Mughal heritage, stayed on. The Walled City was, after all, the capital of the Mughals until the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed and exiled by the British in 1858. In 1911, the British transferred the capital from Kolkata to Delhi and built a new city – New Delhi – on the south side of Old Delhi.Old Delhi lost its status, but residents still derive pride from its historical importance and the fact that Chandi Chowk was once one of the most beautiful streets in the world. Most living here want it preserved as a beautiful historic quarter where visitors can walk without fear of being run over and where residents can enjoy a good quality of life.“It’s about restoring the original beauty of Old Delhi but it’s also about being good for business,” says Santosh Verma, the owner of a stationery shop. “We need a total facelift to create order and cleanliness out of this chaos.”The revamp of the entire area has been discussed for more than 15 years but no government has had the will to push it through. Sachdeva believes the Chandni Chowk project will kickstart the transformation of the whole Old Delhi area, but he has run into his own problems.A group of conservationists and architects have filed petitions in the Delhi high court objecting to one major feature of Sachdeva’s design: the placing of utilities in the central median. They claim this will act as a “wall” between the two sides of the street and destroy the area’s visual integrity.“In redeveloping an area you must respect its heritage, but the spirit of this processional avenue is being destroyed with this design,” says AG Krishna Menon, an architect and urban planner. “You can’t put electrical transformers and public toilets in the middle. It breaks up the whole vista. They need to be somewhere else.”In his studio on the fringes of the capital, Sachdeva sounds weary rather than angry. His design has already been through numerous consultations with multiple stakeholders. While he respects the need for democratic debate, he insists there is no other suitable location for the toilets. As for the transformers, if he had placed them away from the central median and closer to the shops and pavements, the shopkeepers would have been up in arms.“They would have objected. It’s also a safety hazard. Transformers have caught fire in the area. We have to keep them away from the shops and sidewalks,” he says. “Moreover, this is not a conservation project. It is not conserving a monument like the Taj Mahal. This is about re-developing a living street where people live and work. You have to strike a balance between heritage and their needs.”Sachdeva hopes the high court judge will let the scheme proceed. “People here have been waiting a long time for this transformation,” he adds. “We can’t disappoint them.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a3cb43032f8eee5b54fb0b24b4193dfa7cc3b09/0_195_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c78332aa38d7fd90f272e41738b2c9c3","title":"roaming cafes and pirate boats readers favourite floating traders","story":"We asked you to recommend canal boat shops, and you did not disappointFrom home brew kits to pirate-themed gifts, when we asked for your favourite canal boat shops, you certainly gave us variety. Lisa Ashwood told us about a floating sweetshop that she was thrilled to discover near the end of a long, tiring run from Buxton to her home village. “We were all flagging and the sudden discovery of a sweetshop canal boat was just too exciting,” she says.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.Kevin Hall told us about a boat that sells Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, which is often moored near Stoke City’s Bet365 football stadium on match days. And several of you got in touch with glowing endorsements of Sam Skinner’s floating bike repair service (a photo of which we included in our original callout). Here are a selection of your responses:“My favourite boat traders are without doubt the Home Brew Boat. They sell all sorts of home brew equipment and are responsible for getting my husband into home brewing. They continuously cruise, mainly in the north-west and Midlands but have a thriving mail order part to their business and Barry is always happy to answer questions or have his expertise tapped.“We love it when we are in their vicinity. Barry and Sandra are such engaging and enthusiastic proprietors that passing the time of day with them is always enjoyable and often leads to us buying yet more home brew stuff. When our supplies run low and we are not nearby we make use of mail order. As a sideline they sell Barry’s greetings cards which are printed with fabulous photos he’s taken (he was a professional photographer for 30 years before taking to the canals).” Helen Tidy, Aldridge“Cake on the Cut is run by Sam Keay on a narrowboat called Squox and Botter. Not only is it a fantastic cafe boat selling lots of yummy cakes and treats, she makes and sells Gangplank Spirits and Preserves which are produced with foraged fruit and herbs. Super tasty! A friendly trader with a very unusual paint job on her narrowboat – both sides are different and depict scenes of nature. She always sets up her roaming cafe with lots of cute tables, chairs, flowers and sometimes hammocks.” Katie lives on a narrowboat in Hertfordshire“The Pirate Boat sells various items, which all have a pirate theme. The last time we visited it was also selling ice cream and hot drinks. My kids absolutely love visiting this boat – the owner is a real character, she dresses like a pirate and interacts with everyone. My little boy was ecstatic when she handed him an inflatable sword and proceeded to have a play sword fight with him.” Anonymous“My favourite narrowboat is based on the Upper Peak Forest canal (and seen on the Macclesfield canal and also the Middlewich to Macclesfield stretch of the Trent and Mersey canal). The boat is called Andechs and an online music school is run from on board. They offer a huge range of live online instrumental music lessons provided by their music teachers who are based all over the world. I love the idea of their use of the latest technology from what was once the latest technology over 200 years ago, when the canals were built for very different commercial use.” Richard Foster, New Mills, Derbyshire“Hekla was in Watford last week, Mile End market this week, and who knows where next week. They’re a very nice couple selling very nice pictures and a very good book all round the network. They embody the spirit of the canals, using the system as it should be, travelling round making and selling stuff, with a friendly face taking your money off you.” John Williamson“Colin and Carole Warring from the Wool Boat sell commercial and indie yarn and dyed yarn, and are generally all round good eggs. In a pretty competitive market they endeavour to bring people together. Their boat reaches people who knit in far-flung communities and they champion English wool.” Cathy Wright, Ormskirk“Floating repairs is a mystical mechanical trip of bicycle bliss with long-legged Sammy making frames soldered in heaven. Makes a good cuppa too while you’re waiting for your ride to be repaired.” Imogen“The Oakcake boat is on the Trent and Mersey canal, opposite a local wildlife area known as Westport Lake. It serves fabulous Staffordshire oatcakes filled with cheese and bacon, plus tea and coffee. This place is a local institution and is very popular along this stretch of the canal. Also moors near Stoke City’s Bet365 stadium on match days. It serves the best oatcakes, our local delicacy that resembles a pancake but is made with oatmeal and is savoury rather than sweet.

For the past eight weeks the participants and producers have occupied a cultural hotspot, their show the talk of water coolers and social media feeds across the land. Last year’s concluding episode won the highest-ever audience for ITV2 and this year’s win by Greg O’Shea and Amber Gill proved that the format retains the power to surprise.But if a comedown is inevitable following weeks of dramatic competition, the journey back to earth was speeded up by Ofcom’s announcement that it plans to add two new rules to the broadcasting code. The regulator’s aim is to ensure that reality show contestants are offered stronger protection from the emotional turbulence that can follow from their sudden celebrity – or indeed notoriety. If agreed, the new requirements to protect the dignity of members of the public, and avoid causing them “unjustified distress or anxiety”, will also make the job of making such entertainment programmes much more onerous.This is as it should be, as the viewing public and ITV surely know following the Jeremy Kyle Show’s cancellation after a participant, Steve Dymond, took his own life earlier this year. Even for celebrities, roles in reality TV shows such as Strictly Come Dancing can have life-changing effects. For very young adults who have little or no experience of television and who may, by virtue of having applied to a show such as Love Island, reasonably be assumed to harbour longings for fame (and affection, the pursuit of which is purportedly the point of Love Island), the experience can be overwhelming. Two former Love Island contestants, Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon, have killed themselves. While their TV experiences were not comparable to Mr Dymond’s humiliation, it is right that these events have led to a rethink of broadcasters’ obligations. While we can never know to what extent their participation contributed to their unhappiness, new rules should support contestants, while ensuring that the makers of current affairs, news, and other factual programmes are free to get on with their jobs. They are not responsible for the current crisis of confidence and Ofcom must protect them from any adverse, inhibiting effects.Broadcasters are not the only media companies who need to get their houses in order, and will be understandably frustrated if an uneven playing field is not soon levelled off. Ofcom’s remit should be broadened to take in Netflix and equivalent producers, while a separate watchdog to deal with YouTube and other user-generated streaming and social media services cannot come soon enough. Politicians as well as regulators should recognise that the reason the risk associated with reality television has grown is less to do with the format’s development, from Big Brother onwards, and more to do with the rise of social messaging, video streaming and so on. Where once a contestant might have enjoyed, or rued, their several weeks’ worth of fame, but then moved on with their life, it has become far harder to escape from the impression they have made.Reality TV is often derided as cruel and exhibitionist, but viewers and contestants are often kinder than such caricatures give them credit for. We all make mistakes and when young people’s real lives, bodies and feelings are turned into popular entertainment, they deserve support from those who profit from them.• In the UK and Irish Republic contact Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed itNow what? I have given up alcohol for a month. That’s nothing special. Thousands of people do Dry July or Feb Fast or some random month. But it is a big thing. I hadn’t had 30 days off alcohol my entire adult life.The reason I thought it was a good idea isn’t unique either. It’s boringly familiar. I’m middle aged and, after drinking modestly for decades, it had crept up. One glass of wine a night became two, and then three and – no point in skirting around the facts here – too often it was a bottle, sometimes more. Occasionally, if I was particularly anxious, I’d buy a bottle of wine during the day and drink the lot.There’s shame in even writing that, but it’s true. Over the past few years, my husband and I had countless discussions and a few raging arguments about cutting back alcohol, and we tried the obligatory “alcohol-free nights”. But in the jargon of the online crowd experimenting with the previously unthinkable, I was “sober curious”.One of my main worries was what on earth I would do in the evenings. Drinking was what I “did” – preferably alone in my head or watching some Netflix show or offering random opinions on Twitter.Feeling slow or a little sad in the mornings was so normal I barely noticed it. Work was interesting but I lacked ambition. I avoided people, not especially enjoying everyday things like going for a walk, or a seeing a movie, or meeting friends for lunch. It took me a few years to grasp it, but alcohol was controlling my life to an extent that I found it hard to hide, even to myself. I had watched my father commit the slow suicide of the middle class, slumped drunk in front of the television. I had contempt for him at the time, and I was becoming him.Every person is different. Jill Stark was a young single woman when she wrote High Sobriety, and her tussle with alcohol was about social binge drinking. Peter FitzSimons wanted to lose weight and shape up and I envied his blokey pragmatism – “stop being a piss-head” seemed as good advice as any. I have friends with demanding jobs raising young children alone and they really, really feel like a drink after all-day playdates.I often quoted Hemingway: “I drink to make other people more interesting.” But it wasn’t true. I drank to pretend that my life was more interesting than it was, to escape from everyday problems, and because I enjoyed it. Or maybe that’s self-justifying crap. Maybe it’s just that alcohol is an addictive substance like all of those illicit drugs we demonise and, over the years, I had become addicted.So, now what? The problem with giving up alcohol for a month is that it’s ridiculously, unexpectedly good. I had entirely novel experiences. Like meeting friends for a drink before the theatre and not drinking. Like not drinking on a Friday night. Like going to a family lunch and sipping mineral water. Like going to a book launch and standing around for an hour without drinking the warm, cheap white wine.The month wasn’t entirely alcohol free. I drank one night, on Monday 15 July. It was the day my healthy, vibrant, full-of-life mother, out of the blue, was diagnosed with a very serious illness. My first thought was automatic – “I need a drink” – and I drank a bottle of red wine, feeling overwhelmed by sadness, trawling through the internet to read up on the disease, and expecting the worst about how my family would emotionally cope.But what happened the next day was, for me, astonishing. I had a slightly hungover thought: “Drinking won’t help. It won’t help me, and it won’t help Mum. Drinking will make things worse.” I had never had such a thought in my life.There is a sense of achievement in doing something you weren’t quite sure you could do, even something relatively modest as giving up booze for a month. But I wasn’t expecting the scale and scope of its impact. After two weeks or so, I posted on my Facebook page: “Have discovered (a bit of a surprise to be honest), am a better, kinder, more present, more energetic, more productive, happier person when I don’t drink. What a bummer!”I was only going to give up for one month but these things were hard to dismiss. I was more mentally available for friends and family, a better listener, less swift to judge. I was more productive, and the stir of ambition returned. I ate better, exercised more. I slept like a baby, no longer waking up feeling foggy. I was a happier person.As an over-researcher, I read countless articles and several books. Alcohol is a toxic, addictive substance that our body works hard to expel. That’s it. I’m not preaching but it’s the truth and we all kind of know it. It’s so ubiquitous, so glamorised in popular culture, so cleverly advertised, we’re in communal denial, although that seems to be slowly changing.It’s difficult to argue with the largest and most detailed research into the global impact of alcohol, which found that the idea that “moderate drinking” was harmless or even beneficial was a myth (one that the alcohol industry promotes relentlessly). The more you drink, the worse the risks, but even occasional drinking is bad for you.Alcohol causes several forms of cancer and increases your risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Its role in violence is undeniable. In Australia, it causes more harm than any other drug. The evidence is there, but still, what a bummer. If I’m honest, what I missed most is that feeling 30 minutes or so after the first drink. The feeling of bliss, when problems float away. I was indeed invincible, witty, about to do brilliant things any moment now. Short-lived, un-ironic, self-aggrandisement.Could that feeling, however brief, whatever the price, be worth it? Part of me still thinks yes. Surely I can reduce drinking and still get to feel that euphoria, that numbing of incessant thoughts, that fading of inhibition.But after one month, the benefits of sobriety outweighed the benefits of alcohol, no matter how hard I tried to spin it. While my husband looks forward to Alcohol August, I am thinking of going another month without booze. I can’t say I won’t drink again – the thought is terrifying – but the ledger leans too far one way to be ignored.Cheers to that.• Comments on this piece will be premoderated"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a4fd4b5a51df5e06d11ad1c364a19997287c8cf/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b558945e968f0e5f47f5421d18c5442e","title":"from ice hotels to icebergs the ultimate unmissable canada adventures","story":"Do you fancy saddling up to drive cattle, taking part in a lobster crawl or visiting the Arctic tundra to spot polar bears? If so, Canada has it covered … Thanks to its combination of natural beauty and a widely varied landscape, Canada lends itself to a vast range of outdoor pursuits. As the world’s second-largest country and ning 10 provinces and three territories, it really does have something for everyone.Try out cowboy skills on a ranch in AlbertaPerfect for: learning new skillsAlberta may be known for its iconic national parks (Banff has to be seen to be believed), but south of Banff has just as much to offer, in the form of cowboy country. With rolling foothills, vast cattle grounds, and sunsets that’ll stop you in your tracks, experience the cowboy lifestyle at one of the numerous working and guest ranches in the region. Saddle up for some cattle driving, help with daily chores, try your hand at horseshoe tossing, or opt for one of the more hotel-like guest ranches, with experiences such as horseback camping trips or even spa services on offer. Either way, you’re guaranteed a warm welcome, a break from the fast-pace of modern life, and an unforgettable stay. There are even half-day horse rides if you’re worried about being saddle sore.Mountain bike in Whistler, British ColumbiaPerfect for: thrill-seekersThe Whistler Blackcomb resort may be known as one of North America’s top skiing destinations, but when spring arrives and the snow melts, it transforms into something else: a playground for downhill mountain biking. Whistler Mountain Bike Park is accessible from Whistler Village by chairlift from mid-May to mid-October, and although the network of trails – ning 50 miles and 1,500 vertical metres (4,900 feet) – may seem daunting, the technical, tighter runs are balanced with smoother toboggan-like beginner zones, meaning you don’t have to be a pro to take on this adrenaline kick of an experience. It’s best to experience the trails yourself in June and September. When you’ve had your fill of two wheels, then enjoy a glass of wine in one of Canada’s largest wine regions.Celebrate Canada Day in Ottawa, OntarioPerfect for: fans of live musicWhere better to celebrate Canada Day than the country’s capital, Ottawa? Settle in at various spots around the city – Confederation Boulevard, Major’s Hill Park or the Ottawa River – and enjoy a full line-up of entertainment, including an air show courtesy of the Canadian armed forces, musical performances from the likes of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, followed by a fireworks display that’s sure to inspire Canadian pride, no matter where you’re from. There’s also free entry to national museums and art galleries.Explore the lakes of OntarioPerfect for: unwinding in the sunWhen the Canadian summer hits, Ontario cottage country is the place to be. Think lazy days gazing out at picture-perfect views, jumping off docks into the cool waters of crystal-clear lakes, boat cruises, kayaking, barbecues out on the deck, and above all, unwinding to the point of total relaxation. Among the many canoeing opportunities, paddling a voyager canoe on the Mattawa River stands out. Pretend you’re a fur trader by joining guides in a 30-foot craft, with the option to visit Talon Chute waterfall. Visiting Ontario is an experience you’ll want to return to again and again. With a wide choice of resorts available, you can ensure a unique stay every time, too.Go on a polar bear safari in Manitoba (and see the northern lights)Perfect for: adventurous animal-loversForget the Big Five – you’re in Canada now, and safari means one thing: polar bears. To see them in the wild you’ll need to head to Churchill, Manitoba – a region perfectly placed for spotting the iconic (and endangered) white bears in their natural environment, as they wait on the shore for the Hudson Bay freeze before heading out to hunt for seals. Several tour operators offer excursions in adapted vehicles out into the Arctic tundra, with one-day trips or longer expeditions available. It’s not just polar bears that make this a once-in-a-lifetime trip either, because Churchill is also one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights. A two-for-one deal, if you will.Spend a night at the Hotel de Glace in QuebecPerfect for: stepping out of your comfort zoneDrive a few hours out of the historic Quebec city and you’ll find a hotel that’s a little on the chilly side of things. Why? Because it’s made out of ice. You’ll need to time your stay within a very specific window though: Hôtel de Glace is constructed in January and melts away in March each year. Because, you know, ice. With 44 rooms, a chapel, ice bar and even slides, this construction is a work of art and engineering as well as a place to rest your head (day visitors also welcome). Don’t worry about freezing in your sleep either – while the various sofas, chairs and tables are carved out of ice, beds feature soft (and warm!) mattresses, with duvets to boot.Catch and eat lobster in Atlantic CanadaPerfect for: foodiesWhen it comes to Nova Scotia, it doesn’t get more authentic than heading out into the waters of the North Atlantic with an experienced fisherman to catch your own lobster, before enjoying an on-board seafood boil. If fishing isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy the rewards without the work – especially if you’re planning to visit in February, which sees Nova Scotia’s South Shore Lobster Crawl festival take place along the shore each year. A lobster-lover’s dream, it includes an abundance of events, including the best lobster roll challenge. Yum.Visit Iceberg Alley on the Newfoundland coastPerfect for: lovers of the natural worldFerryland, an hour south of St John’s, Newfoundland, made headlines in 2017 thanks to a rather unique neighbour, in the form of a giant iceberg. The town is located right on a part of Canada’s east coast known as Iceberg Alley, so-called because hundreds of icebergs that break off in the Arctic float down past the Newfoundland and Labrador from spring to September. And while the behemoth that took up residence on Ferryland’s doorstep was a particularly large example, you can spot these 10,000-year-old glacial giants from many viewing points along the northern and eastern coasts of this province, by boat tour or kayak. You can even track them online.Walk on the ocean floor in the Bay of FundyPerfect for: intrepid explorersFancy going for a walk? How about a stroll along the actual ocean floor? It may sound out-of-this-world, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible – because in the Bay of Fundy, which lies between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, you can do just that. It’s all thanks to the unusual variance between low and high tide in the bay, which can exceed 15 metres. At low tide, the ocean floor at the head of the bay is exposed for around three hours, with towering cliffs and sea stacks creating a surreal backdrop to seafloor exploration – which often yields the discovery of fossils, sea glass, and semi-precious stones. Then visit a few hours later to see how fast the water returns.Fly WestJet from London to Canada’s capital cities and have your own Canadian adventure"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e881a855aa340d25a1e6f3d32072cb60","title":"only in canada weird and wonderful experiences countrywide","story":"Want to track down the mythical Ogopogo, ice-skate on the Atlantic Ocean or get your hands on a polar bear-shaped number plate?

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg. They use natural ingredients and have been known to offer unique flavours such as roasted garlic and asiago cheese or rosemary and lavender. We have to wonder what Homer Simpson would order!Want a polar bear-shaped number plate? You’ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happenIn Canada’s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound – in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we’ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay.If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest. Travellers have been bringing signposts from their hometowns since 1942 and you can carry on that tradition with one of your own.Ogopogo is a mythical monster similar to the Loch Ness monster that supposedly lives in Lake Okanagan, British ColumbiaDo you believe in folklore and mystery? Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada’s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour. Alternatively, check out one of the latest local theatre shows at the Caravan Farm Theatre under the stars. Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it’s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists. If you want to see if you can sneak a peek of Ogopogo, why not try scuba ing at Fintry provincial park? It also houses a sunken Canadian Pacific Railway barge, should you not get lucky with the monster.Did you know that Santa Claus had a legitimate postal address?

Those with a return address will receive a letter back, from Santa’s elvesEach and every single year as a child, it was a tradition to write a letter to Santa. At Canada Post, they have set up a system to ensure that every child who writes from home gets a personal response from Saint Nick.

Get yourself to Churchill, ManitobaIf there is one thing you need to know, it’s that Churchill, Manitoba, is known for its abundance of Canadian wildlife. Many belugas migrate through Hudson Bay in the months of July and August, when tens of thousands pass through the area. Thanks to Sea North Tours, you’ll be able to have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear belugas singing through hydrophones – you can listen to their whistles and squeals while observing their majestic beauty from boats that have no moving parts that can harm the whales.The province where Anne of Green Gables was set, Prince Edward Island is just 140 miles long and 35 miles wideFun fact: as one of Canada’s three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is the smallest. Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81d4093f971aa8861ef4a2a21fe79c0c779ff63/778_711_4344_2607/master/4344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797ba3ae7098c3768e9dae8aa5709ef1","title":"how to make the most of montreal a locals guide","story":"Music festivals, decadent food and old-world architecture make Canada’s second-largest city, in the French-speaking province of Quebec, a must to explore. Local Heather Vandenengel gives her recommendations for MontrealStarting from the first decently warm day of spring, green spaces across the city fill up with picnickers, pétanque players, and hammockers. Huge murals from world-renowned street artists are splashed up and down Boulevard Saint-Laurent every June, while Place des Festivals lights up with glowing, interactive art installations in winter and musical swings in summer. And of course, there’s the year-round smattering of festivals, highlighting everything from documentary films to up-and-coming music acts to stand-up comedy. The best way to get to know Montreal’s energy and charm is on foot or by bike (if it’s above freezing, at least), winding through its neighbourhoods and streets.“Montreal is great for biking! It’s a great way to explore beyond the mains, to find hidden gems, see the green alleyways, and hop from one neighbourhood to another.” Anne-Marie Pellerin, @am.pellerin, co-founder, Spade \u0026amp Palacio toursDowntown and Old MontrealDowntown is the perfect starting point to discover the traditions and architecture of this vibrant city. And while Old Montreal, with its cobblestone streets and 17th- and 18th-century buildings, evokes the city’s old-world charm, the area has also gained a hipper edge in recent years, thanks to additions such as Lov, a chic, creative vegan and vegetarian restaurant, and Unibar, a tucked-away classic burger spot specialising in natural wines. The Old Port area, overlooking the St Lawrence River, is also an outdoor event hotspot, home to poutine fests, winter electronic music events, and views of summer fireworks.“Poutine is our dish, we’re known worldwide for it. I like the Orange Julep, it’s an iconic landmark in Montreal and their poutine is really exceptional. La Banquise is open 24 hours, but it doesn’t matter what time of the day you go, there’s always a line-up.” Eric Branover, @ericbranover, photographerThe sprawling downtown includes major cultural venues such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal (Mac), both of which offer discounted admission on Wednesday nights and the chance to rub shoulders with locals. You can dig into dumplings, hand-pulled noodles, or Mongolian hotpot in the city’s original Chinatown, marked by ornate paifang gates, or explore the smattering of small, often-packed restaurants in the city’s “Second Chinatown” around Concordia University. Cap it off with a late-night tiki drink at atmospheric Bar Le Mal Nécessaire, or sing a round at a private-room karaoke bar.The south-westRide along the Lachine canal path for a peaceful riverside journey to the south-west neighbourhoods of Saint-Henri and Little Burgundy.

The area’s heritage, blending Portuguese, Jewish, and Greek cultures, is reflected in high-end Greek seafood restaurants, 24-hour bagel shops, and rotisserie chicken take-out spots.

But he was letting other people in.”Asked if ersity had improved in the fashion industry, she said she would “like to be able to say so”, citing the model Bethann Hardison as a “pioneer”. She said: “I have always tried to remain an optimist on this issue.”Of new models, she said: “I tell them never to let anyone underestimate their value.

His preference is to stay at Juventus but an attractive offer could change his mind and he knows his club would like him to go if it clears the way to sign Lukaku.Dybala is a creative attacking player who joined Juventus from Palermo in 2015 for an initial €32m and was part of the Argentina squad at last year’s World Cup and this year’s Copa América.The 25-year-old can play across a variety of attacking roles and scored the only goal in Juventus’s Champions League group victory at Old Trafford last October.Lukaku has been a prime target for Antonio Conte but Internazionale failed with a £54m bid and have said they cannot increase that.“We made a strong offer, one that is valid and suited to the transfer value of the player and we were unable to conclude a deal,” the Inter chief executive, Beppe Marotta, told Sky Sport Italia. “The club is strong, but we need to stay within certain parameters. The club has made big investments and we believe we’re already at a good stage in the process.”That has led Juventus, who are managed by Maurizio Sarri, to try to sign Lukaku. The forward is keen on a transfer after two seasons at United, whom he joined from Everton.Lukaku has not played in pre-season because of injury and was not part of the squad who beat Kristiansund in Norway on Tuesday night in the penultimate match for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team before their opening Premier League game at home to Chelsea on Sunday 11 August. Solskjær’s return to his hometown club was marred by the confirmation that Eric Bailly faces up to five months out following knee surgery. United’s manager revealed the extent of Bailly’s injury after Juan Mata’s late penalty gave his side a 1-0 win over the team from the town where he was born – and for whom the Norwegian’s son Noah made his debut as a late substitute. Bailly suffered the injury during United’s 2-1 win over Tottenham in their pre-season meeting in Shanghai last week.Paul Pogba was left on the bench for the first hour despite Solskjær, who watched the game with his other son, Elijah, fielding a strong lineup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05d55532fd74ac81135444c7df849eb3410c95/0_83_4558_2735/master/4558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e942e813227de2c27ef366da401ec6b3","title":"pochettino spurs job title tranfers real madrid gareth bale","story":"Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham should change his job title to coach because he has no influence over transfers after Harry Kane’s winner gave his side a 1-0 Audi Cup win over Real Madrid.Pochettino, who has previously intimated frustration with his club’s transfer policy, watched as Harry Kane’s first-half strike proved enough to see them past Zinedine Zidane’s side.

Bury, in League One, were subjected to a last-resort measure, of having Saturday’s opening fixture suspended, on the grounds that the owner, Steve Dale, has not provided the required information to show how the stricken club will be funded.This sorry mess and financial collapse, a genuine jeopardy now to the existence of a club established in 1885, a member of the Football League for 125 years, has highlighted a hole in the EFL rules designed to protect clubs’ viability. The league’s position, denied by Dale, is he has never provided full proof of funds, as specifically required by its regulations, either before or after his £1 takeover in December. With the opening match against MK Dons at Gigg Lane just days away, the board, led by the executive chair Debbie Jevans, could not approve the club as safe to start.This requirement that prospective owners at least show they have the money to run a club, coupled with the owners and directors “fit and proper persons” test – a most basic character self-certification – are about the only protections supporters have when their clubs are in the process of being taken over.The “fit and proper person test”, introduced in 2004 after years of resistance to it by the Premier and Football Leagues, in effect only bars people who have unspent criminal convictions for dishonesty, or are currently disqualified directors or bankrupt. The unambitious nature of that quality control has always been a complaint of supporters who find their owner behaving disgracefully or outrageously, and regulations were passed last summer to also bar people whose conduct has been shown to be “clearly damaging to the standing and reputation of the wider profession and the game of football”.But in a process subject to forensic legal challenge on every word by expensively paid lawyers for people determined to take over clubs, the detail of that new regulation has not yet been worked up, so the test remains basic.The requirement that a new owner shows he has the money to fund a club is the only other vital step in the process, and there have been times when the EFL has in effect said publicly it has blocked a takeover because it has not been satisfied the money is truly there. In the case of Bury, it is the EFL’s version of events that Dale never provided full, satisfactory proof of funds as required under these regulations, but he nevertheless took over the club and remains the owner. According to Companies House, he is also Bury’s sole director – there is no board.Descending into the wording of the rules, a weakness is that while a new owner must submit all relevant financial information before a takeover or at the latest within 10 working days, he can be barred for failing the “fit and proper person test” but not for failing to provide proof of funds. The league can refuse to approve a takeover where a person has engaged with the process in advance but apparently not where, as with Bury – whose then owner, Stewart Day, was in financial difficulties – Dale’s takeover was concluded quickly without going through the league’s requirements first.The penalty for failing to provide the necessary information after a takeover is a player registration embargo, to which Bury are subject, and there is scope for other measures, but the takeover itself stands.Hence Bury, a club of precious heritage with a core of supporters loyally resisting Manchester’s Premier League temptations 10 miles to the south, find themselves in a paralysed standoff, the future very uncertain. When the volleys from Dale have been responded to and the crisis at Gigg Lane somehow concluded, the EFL needs to have a firm review of its rules, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/712211fe44523bf037833d546636e5cbc36abed2/0_0_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6175dede3d4e768818cfd30f703439a","title":"how to keep valuables safe use cereal and toy boxes say ex burglars","story":"Panel of ex-offenders reveals underwear drawers and pillows are first places to be checkedForget hiding your valuables under your pillow, in a safe or stuffing them in your underwear drawer – those are among the first places professional burglars look for jewellery and cash.A panel of former burglars, brought together by department store chain John Lewis, have advised holidaymakers that the safest places for family heirlooms are actually cereal boxes or storage for children’s toys.He said people often keep valuables, such as car keys, in their kitchens but they are usually easy to find. “Most people have got a ‘bits and bobs’ cupboard in their kitchen where they often keep their keys,” he told experts at John Lewis home insurance. “DVD cases is another good place to hide valuables because they are harder to find.”People were also advised to stash valuables inside toy boxes in children’s bedrooms saying that there was an “unwritten rule” that thieves do not enter kids’ rooms.The panel of six ex-burglars, who were put in touch with John Lewis via the St Giles Trust charity which helps ex-offenders back into legitimate work, said the rise in online shopping has made it much easier to identify unoccupied homes.“If you’re walking down the road and see a parcel on a doorstep there is a good chance someone is not in,” a member of the panel said. “I would suggest not ordering parcels if you won’t be around when they arrive and getting neighbours to check for parcel deliveries regularly while you’re away.”The Office of National Statistics (ONS) uses two main sources for their crime data statistical bulletins: the Crime Survey for England and Wales and the police recorded crime numbers.The Crime Survey for England and Wales is a face-to-face questionnaire. People are asked about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview. The ONS say this is the most reliable indicator for long-term trends, as it isn\u0027t subject to changes in the way that police forces monitor and record crime, and it will include people talking about experiences that weren\u0027t reported to the police.\u0026nbspPolice recorded crime is the number of notifiable crimes reported to and recorded by the police. The list of notifiable crimes is determined by the Home Office. The ONS say this data is more reliable for the recording of rarer crimes, like murder, and for crimes like theft, where people are often inclined to report a crime to the police as part of an insurance claim. This data cannot measure crimes not reported to the police because victims felt them too trivial, or where they may be reluctant to come forward to the police for personal reasons.Leaving lights either on or off for long periods was also identified as a key giveaway. The best room to leave lights on when away is the hallway, the panel said, but timer switches were deemed the best option because it creates a better illusion that someone was at home.Burglars can spend up to two months watching a house before making their move, but would spend as little as five minutes inside before fleeing.Some of the ex-offenders questioned said they target identity documents – such as passports, driving licences, credit cards and bank statements – rather than stealing TVs or DVD players because of the potential gains from selling the information on.Dr Claire Nee, director of the International Centre for Research in Forensic Psychology at Portsmouth University, who has interviewed hundreds of burglars to analyse patterns in offending said: “Identity documents are very valuable at the minute due to identity theft for fraud and people trafficking.“We also know from both our research and criminal statistics that burglars are going for small, valuable items – jewellery, electronics and cash.“Finally, be careful about your conversation on the way to the airport. Talk loudly about your house sitter for instance, not about how you are looking forward to your fortnight away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8800782287458cbc0cc3b258f04671b06b465a70/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a49e66ee70820d279abf08520660bb0","title":"amazon 25 powerful jeff bezos podcast","story":"In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the company that has since made him the richest man in the world.

While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

How could it end up happening? And what would it mean?No deal is the default – without a withdrawal agreement in place it takes place automatically on 31 October. A new deal seems increasingly unlikely given that Boris Johnson and his ministers have demanded terms – scrapping the Irish backstop and an entirely new withdrawal deal – that have been repeatedly rejected by Brussels and would be hugely ambitious anyway given the 93-day deadline.It seems a majority of MPs still oppose a no-deal departure, as they did in March. It nonetheless remains unknown if the Commons can block Johnson if he is intent on such a Brexit, whether or not proroguing parliament is possible. MPs would need to create the circumstances for a binding vote and it is unclear how this might be done. It is worth noting here that some in Westminster see a government intent on no deal being blocked by parliament as Johnson’s preferred scenario – allowing him to call an election as the self-styled champion of Brexit.The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy – something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the ‘Gaukward squad’ of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care the future of the NHS a climate emergency the increasingly insecure future of work a broken housing market rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle - his adopting the acronym \u0027Dude\u0027 in his victory speech shows just how hard it is for him.\u0026nbspIt would simply mean that at 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. This would drop the UK out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The government began preparing for possible no deal ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March, passing legislation to cover areas such as nuclear material, money laundering and road haulage, and moving thousands of civil servants to make no-deal plans. While some warn that the government is still less prepared for an October no deal, planning has been stepped up under Johnson, with Michael Gove handed a cross-government cabinet role to lead on this, complete with a select cabinet sub-committee. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has promised extra funds in the event of no deal and could put together an autumn budget intended to rejuvenate the economy. The government is also reportedly spending up to £100m on an advertising campaign to let businesses and people know how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.It would involve checks of some form, whatever the UK government’s insistence that it will not impose any infrastructure. As the Irish government has pointed out repeatedly, Ireland cannot remain a part of the EU’s single market and allow the unmonitored flow of goods across what will then become a customs, standards and regulation border. While there is an understandable desire to avoid infrastructure on the frontier – which has so many crossing points it is virtually impossible to completely police anyway – some new system of checks would come into place.This is a question which the Johnson government has, as yet, not answered, particularly in the context of the many tax cuts and spending plans so far unveiled. Much of this has been based on the idea of using some or all of the £26bn or so of “fiscal headroom” – extra borrowing that would be permitted within current limits – to pay for this. However, Treasury forecasts say this money would evaporate in the economic hit of no deal. On the campaign trail Johnson said the government could instead use the £39bn orce settlement with the EU. However, this is not a credible plan, as the sum covers a series of already-agreed UK commitments paid over a number of years. Some of the money could not be clawed back, and to renege on other payments would severely damage the UK’s financial credibility.No. One of the biggest appeals about a no-deal Brexit for voters who support it is the idea of “getting it over with”, absorbing whatever chaos takes place and moving on to other priorities. But this is a fantasy. The UK could not trade perpetually on WTO terms and would need to make a permanent trade deal with the EU – involving just the same issues as before, such as a orce payment, and arrangements for the Irish border. The main difference is that this would all need to happen as quickly as possible, without the buffer of a transition period running to the end of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffbcfce91bd195d77e5114654252c506e904cc6d/0_513_4580_2748/master/4580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7df0a41b241a0cd85b1584f7ee5252bf","title":"dominic raab to urge firms to focus more on exporting outside eu business trade","story":"Business reiterates importance of frictionless trade with EU as foreign minister heads to AsiaBusiness groups have stressed the importance of continued frictionless trade with the EU after Dominic Raab used his first overseas trip as foreign secretary to urge UK firms to “raise their game” and focus more on exporting to other regions.Organisations including the CBI and Make UK, which represents the manufacturing sector, said that while British companies had already expanded to countries across the globe, exports to the EU accounted for almost half of the total.Raab is due to join a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Bangkok on Wednesday to push for closer trade links with the 10-member bloc.In comments released in advance, he said UK companies were not being sufficiently ambitious in targeting non-European markets: “For too long, our trade focus has been on Europe. We need to expand our horizons, and raise our game.“That means grasping the enormous global opportunities for the UK - and my first trip as foreign secretary will look to strengthen our friendships across Asia.”A CBI spokesman said post-Brexit it was vital that the UK seized “the many opportunities in rapidly growing markets across the globe”.Ben Fletcher, head of policy for Make UK, said: “From a manufacturing perspective, about half our exports go to the EU, but that’s in keeping with pretty much every major economy – you trade in majority terms with your nearest neighbours.”“We get help from the government on expanding exports, but in some cases even more intelligence from the Foreign Office about big projects or new markets would be incredibly useful.”Martin McTague, head of policy for the Federation of Small Businesses, said it was necessary to increase exports to south-east Asia.“However, it’s crucial we have an orderly exit from the European Union which is the number one priority market for our members as well as replicating the 30 overseas trade agreements that are currently in place,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca7b19f67c9604ffd4f8fe1bdea643b57a04566e/0_103_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f5f6f475050e73991600a210b3a6d49","title":"ben stokes england australia ashes","story":"• ‘You want to stamp your authority with bat and ball’• Jofra Archer misses chance to prove fitnessBen Stokes expects Australia’s new clean-cut image to disappear once the Ashes get under way at Edgbaston on Thursday, with England’s newly restored vice-captain telling his teammates they must hit the tourists hard to lay down an early marker.Just 18 days on from the emotional rollercoaster of the World Cup final, England must steel themselves for five Tests against an Australia side who have seemingly turned around their cricket since last year’s ball-tampering scandal.Stokes, who missed the 4-0 defeat in 2017-18 while still under the cloud of the Bristol incident, is still expecting a battle over the next seven weeks and for flashpoints to arise.He said: “It is weird Aussies trying to be nice to you. I think once you get out in the middle and cross the white line, the real competitive side of both teams will come out and Ashes are the biggest Test series played in the world.“There is always something that happens between teams in Ashes series and I don’t think this will be any different. Both teams are desperate to win, both sets of players are desperate to perform because Ashes series are where you get scrutinised and criticised more, or praised if you do well.”England, who have confirmed Joe Root will return to No 3 as Joe Denly drops down a spot, welcome back Jimmy Anderson after a calf problem. The uncapped Jofra Archer was denied the chance to fully prove his fitness on Tuesday when heavy rain in Birmingham forced training inside. Regardless of the XI, and the outcome of the toss, Stokes is demanding instant impact.He said: “I think that first morning of any series is when you want to stamp your authority as a team with bat and ball. Getting off to a good start can make it flow throughout the series.“You want to be the team on top and win that first day because hopefully that can carry on into the next four. If you go 1-0 down in a series it can be hard to come back from so you want to start very well.”Asked how important it will be to get on top of David Warner, the firebrand opener who served a 12-month ban for his part in the Cape Town scandal, Stokes replied: “He is a player who can take games away from you. He is a phenomenal batsman and very dangerous opener. So to tie him down and not let him establish his authority against us would be a really big plus.“We don’t want to give anything away to any of their batsmen. We want to let them know we are here to be serious and everyone in the changing room is desperately trying to get that urn back because it’s not good them having it.”Such drive and passion from Stokes was absent from England’s Ashes campaign 18 months ago, when Root appeared slightly isolated as a leader. It led to Ricky Ponting, the former Australia captain, claiming he was like a “little boy” and “soft” when speaking publicly.Stokes, who missed last week’s Test win over Ireland to recharge at home, has returned to the vice-captaincy. It is a reward for both his World Cup heroics and 18 months of hard work, with the all-rounder looking to repay his old friend.Asked if he feels ready to step up and lead should Root go down injured in the series, Stokes said: “Touch wood, nothing does happen but I’ve played enough cricket now with this group – especially Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad – to understand what works for them. If anything happens I know I have a group of senior players who can help me through that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa351f7e75eb3b7540176ae42ccc351f4ea2ede8/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f1b179d5c9dd9f63c6c2fafc0390a5","title":"caster semenya blocked defending 800 metres title athletics world championships","story":"Caster Semenya will not compete at the World Championships in Doha after a Swiss court stood behind an IAAF rule that would require her to take testosterone-reducing medication.The South African had been expected to defend her world 800m title in late September after the Swiss Supreme Court had temporarily exempted her from an IAAF rule relating to athletes with differences in sexual development (DSD). That decision has now been overturned by a tribunal at the same court.In a statement issued through her PR agency, Semenya said: “I am very disappointed to be kept from defending my hard-earned title, but this will not deter me from continuing my fight for the human rights of all of the female athletes concerned.”Last month the Swiss Supreme Court temporarily suspended the IAAF rule that requires all DSD athletes to reduce their testosterone to below five nmolL for at least six months if they want to compete internationally at all distances from 400m to a mile.The rule had been at the centre of a landmark case brought against the IAAF by Semenya at the court of arbitration for sport (Cas). That case found in favour of the international athletic body and its claim that high levels of testosterone provided a material advantage in women’s competition.Semenya has refused to take hormone medication and is in the process of appealing against the Cas decision. A temporary stay of the rule had been granted while that appeal continued but the court decided to overturn that decision after finding that the “high threshold” for any suspension had not been fulfilled.Dorothee Schramm, the lawyer leading her appeal, said: “The judge’s procedural decision has no impact on the appeal itself. We will continue to pursue Caster’s appeal and fight for her fundamental human rights. A race is always decided at the finish line.”In a statement, the IAAF said: “We understand the Swiss Federal Tribunal will be issuing its full decision on this order tomorrow (Wednesday) and the IAAF will comment once the tribunal makes its reasoning public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8283f77d59f91e5c6485148fa9815d16d3a5201/0_121_5370_3223/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff5a7494e49cd7720848a0a91be29905","title":"england george kruis mako vunipola world cup brad shields","story":"England are optimistic the key Saracens duo George Kruis and Mako Vunipola will be fit to play a part in their World Cup preparations but Brad Shields may not be ready for the tournament.Shields returned home from the World Cup training camp in Treviso last week with a foot injury and it appears unlikely he will play in the warm-up games before England depart for Japan. John Mitchell, the England defence coach, described Shields’s ligament tear in the lower-foot as “a little bit niggly” and the Wasps flanker is expected to be out for four to six weeks. England have a self-imposed deadline for naming their World Cup squad on 12 August and their first match in Japan is on 22 September in just under eight weeks.In Treviso, the Italian city selected for its heat and humidity to provide the best possible preparation for the climate in Japan, Mitchell said Kruis and Vunipola are showing positive signs in their recovery from ankle and hamstring injuries, respectively.“George is back in training this week which is fantastic,” Mitchell said. “The medical team have done a great job on his progressive return and he is full of enthusiasm and looking great. Mako is progressing nicely, too. We should see him back at some point in August.”England are also awaiting an update on Jack Nowell, who returned home on Monday for a routine surgical review on his ankle.In Shields’s absence Mitchell has been impressed with his replacement – the Harlequins flanker Alex Dombrandt, who has had a meteoric rise through the ranks. He signed for Harlequins in February 2018 and made his England debut in the non-cap win against the Barbarians last month.“Every day he’s getting a little bit better and learning a lot,” Mitchell said. “He’s been quite outstanding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbc517810b758ad6a1fdc6cbffc25f54a5f43b28/0_432_3108_1864/master/3108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73ebbbd4bde216c0ab808fd0a5c51c89","title":"georgia hall higher profile defence womens british open","story":"• Hall won at Royal Lytham \u0026amp St Annes a year ago• ‘Some things happen like this and you get on with it’We may yet witness a happy homecoming for Georgia Hall at the Women’s British Open. Still, in what Hall surely hopes is not an ominous precursor for what lies ahead this week, Tuesday’s discussion involving the champion felt more like an episode of Crimewatch.Hall begins the defence of the trophy she won in emphatic fashion at Royal Lytham \u0026amp St Annes on Thursday. The parkland of Woburn is the venue it remains to be seen whether links courses become a permanent fixture when the R\u0026ampA takes full control of this major from next year. All we know for now is that Troon will kick off the new regime.Two months ago in Chiswick, west London came some unsavoury business which caused Hall alarm. On a rare visit back to England amid a series of tournaments in the United States, she had her replica Open trophy stolen from her car. There is no apparent hope of it being recovered.“They probably melted it down,” said Hall, who is from Bournemouth. “They smashed my back window, like 12 o’clock in the middle of the day, and just took it.“There was no CCTV. I don’t know if they knew it was me or not because it was in the box and everything. And I had golf clubs, as well, and they didn’t take them. A bit strange. It was in a boot with tinted windows.“I was very upset. I was on my own and nothing had happened to me like that before, so I was a little bit scared. Then you feel a bit silly having it in the car. Maybe I should have taken it out. But you know, some things happen like this in life and you just get on with it, I suppose.”Hall, 23, is still waiting to see if she can be issued with another piece of silverware. The practicalities seem to surround the tournament organisers issuing a replacement once insurance matters have been resolved. The original trophy is kept in a case by the R\u0026ampA, at St Andrews.More uplifting was the impact Hall’s Lytham triumph had on the women’s game. The scale of coverage attached to her two-shot win was unprecedented. Over the past 12 months, she has sensed a wider benefit.“Loads of young girls and boys have been messaging me on social media, saying: ‘I have taken up the game because I watched you in the British’,” Hall said.“I am definitely recognised a bit more in America. When I was on holiday in Barbados, quite funny, I got recognised when I was sunbathing, which was sort of strange. But it’s nice that so many people watched that day and to be able to congratulate me.”Plaudits were due, too, to Hall’s father Wayne, who caddied for her Open win. The former plasterer is back on bag duties this week. “I think the last few weeks, he’s been training to be ready for this event,” Hall said. “He’s always been with me, playing golf since I started, so it’s just kind of normal for us, I’d say. He said he’s been going on a lot of walks because obviously you do a lot of walking this week.”Hall enters this major ranked 30th in the world and having finished in a share of 37th at last week’s Evian Championship. General results on the opposite side of the Atlantic give the impression Hall has struggled to adjust to the prominence of being the Open champion. She ended her association with her coach, Dan Grieve, earlier this year.“I’m actually very excited,” Hall said. “I don’t feel any pressure. It’s really nice for me to be home because I’ve been in the US the whole year. “I’ve done the hard travelling and now I can enjoy being at home with a home crowd. I think I’m going to get a lot of support, so I look forward to people out there watching me and cheering me on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2431221338a83e0d60f64c8f6f602d49d54183ea/0_167_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c55135b91d6a298709eaa75922a576d","title":"england australia ashes cricket moeen ali batting","story":"I know I’ve struggled with the bat – the criticism hurts – but I’m going to play with freedom in this Ashes and should be judged on my bowlingThe Ashes are the pinnacle of Test cricket for any England player, and if we can follow up our World Cup victory by winning back the urn from Australia it would represent one of the greatest summers for the sport in this country.It would be quite an English thing to say we need to come down from the extreme high of that day at Lord’s, however. Everyone in the squad would do anything to experience it all again but what we can do is harness the feelings and confidence it gave us, not try to suppress them.Thinking back to the end of the last Ashes series, when Australia celebrated on the outfield of the Sydney Cricket Ground with those oversized hands on the podium rubbing in the 4-0 scoreline, it was obviously a very difficult time. Quite upsetting, really.But those are the moments as cricketers when you make a pledge to yourself that next time around it will be different. From my point of view, it would be great to send Australia home from nearly six months in the country with nothing to show for it.Starting this series at Edgbaston – for me the best ground in the country for home support, and probably the toughest for a visiting team – is a big plus. It was only a couple of weeks ago that we beat Australia convincingly in that World Cup semi-final. That match will be in their minds and the plan is to hit them hard again.But clearly this only goes so far. Test cricket is a different ball game and we respect our opponents. It will be my third Ashes but I expect this one to be a bit different in terms of on-field relations. It’s well known that I have personally received some abuse in the past but Australia are actually quite nice to play against these days.They decided to make a positive change to their cricket after the ball‑tampering thing blew up in South Africa last year and credit must go to Justin Langer, their head coach, and their two captains, Tim Paine and Aaron Finch, because they have turned it around in the space of 18 months.As a team we tend to focus mainly on ourselves, however. And in an Ashes series the best approach as a player is to not get caught up in feeling pressure for your position but to think only about the greater cause. How can I contribute? It could be a single moment, like a blinding catch or a run out. Think only of the team’s needs.As an all-rounder I can affect every innings of the game but in all honesty I know my batting has been a problem of late. Given I’ll probably be coming in at No 8, my primary role is with the ball and since returning to the side last summer against India my record has been strong in this department.I have accepted this for a while, the ball has been coming out nicely and in Test cricket the wickets have followed. But I would be lying if I thought the attention was on this, because even though I am not on social media these days, I am aware of the criticism of my batting in recent times.I have always been a player whose form goes up and down but at the moment I feel my batting confidence is at its lowest. Negative comments can affect you and they probably have. I know I play some horrendous shots at times but, when I do, I feel I attract more stick for it than others.I have batted everywhere in the England team and it has probably caught up with me. It’s not easy for a player who considers him or herself to be a proper batter to then adjust down the order. Put anyone there and the scores won’t necessarily come. You can lose a bit of love for it, too.But after the Ireland Test I decided to consult some of my most trusted advisers: my dad, Munir, my brother, Kadeer, and Paul Farbrace, who was the England assistant coach up until recently. I have had a little reset and the plan is to go out there and simply enjoy my batting again – to not get consumed by negative thoughts and try to play with more freedom than I have.The fact is, my bowling is why I am in the Test team right now and on form, rightly so. Runs are important, don’t get me wrong, but it will be wickets that I will be judged on.But again it comes back to how you can contribute to the cause in any way possible and that is to win back those Ashes – to make 2019 a famous double-winning year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1037db61208f5a7be682ba67ee89e9cdc1316a42/273_780_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e017cebee14c854f76fc442e78da44c","title":"sandbank picnic sailing adventure norfolk coast a photo essay","story":"Getting deliberately grounded on a sandbank – in the company of capable mariners – makes for a captivating day trip exploring Norfolk’s hidden depthsby  Patrick Barkham Photography by Mim HowellWe are sailing on eerily calm blue-grey seas a few miles off the north Norfolk coast. There is no sand visible but the hidden banks below us are written in the surrounding water in the form of ripples, white lines of surf and patches of smooth water. These treacherous shallows possess romantic names on the sea charts – Pandora Sand, Thief Sand, Stubborn Sand – but sailors’ lives depend on avoiding them.The captain of Salford, our beautifully restored whelk boat, is trying to do the opposite, however: he’s trying to run aground on one. Our depth gauge drops from 6.9m to 1.4m. We stop and wait for the tide to beach us. Will we soon discover pristine golden sand?Picnicking and playing cricket on sandbanks at low tide was regarded as a grand day out by hail-and-hearty Victorians but messing around on shifting sands is not favoured in our risk-averse era. When a BBC film crew staged a cricket match on the notorious Goodwin Sands in the Channel a few years back, the in-rushing tide turned their boat over, requiring a lifeboat rescue.So, the decision by the Coastal Exploration Company, a band of capable mariners who take visitors to less-well-known spots on the north Norfolk coast in vintage sailing boats, to restart holidaymaking on sandbanks looks a little reckless. But I had to give it a go.Dom, the skipper, steers our 30ft boat through Wells-next-the-Sea’s pretty harbour in the morning sunshine. Our plan: breakfast on the boat, while we sail west to reach the Wash at low tide and “find a nice little sandbank to dry out on,” as Dom puts it – for lunch and cricket. “Any kind of waves would pick the boat up and slam it onto the sand but these conditions are nice and calm,” he says.Wells’ straggly line of colourful beach huts framed by white sand and dark pines slowly diminish as we head into the North Sea. The calm sea may be safe for us but it’s terrible for sailing. Luckily, Salford has a new engine that purrs as we potter along the coast at 4 knots.The seas here are shallow and studded with sandbanks, many of which now house offshore wind farms. It was once Doggerland and even today it sometimes looks like you can walk across the Wash from Norfolk to Lincolnshire at low tide. I’m astonished to learn that this great expanse of low water also contains a section called The Well, which is 47 metres deep.“Everything about the water is dangerous,” warns Charlie Hodson, our expedition chef and former lifeboat man, which could come in handy. “It’s about how you respect that water in return.”Charlie gives this warning as we pass the black silhouette of a ship wrecked on the sands beyond Scolt Head Island. This vessel was deliberately scuppered and filled with explosives to stop German invaders entering Brancaster harbour but we pass two more authentic wrecks visible on the vast sandy shores of north Norfolk.Despite the depth gauge reading 1.4m, the sandbank above which we first float doesn’t appear even as low tide nears. So we sail further along this wild, tranquil coast of sand dunes, windmills and flint church towers and around Gore Point. Ahead shimmies a line of gold: Sunk Sand, rising around two metres out of the water on the lowest of tides. Cormorants stand on the bank, drying their wings like enormous bats on the far side lounge the banana shapes of a dozen grey seals.Slowly, cautiously, we head towards Sunk Sand. Just beyond 1.5m, we run aground. The water around us is still chest-deep, so we blow up an inflatable dinghy to carry our lunch. I jump in and swim “ashore”, which is not as glamorous as it sounds – it’s easier to wade in the shallow water.We step onto our own utterly otherworldly, (extremely) temporary island. We can see Hunstanton in the distance to the south and Skegness to the far north but there is nothing else, and no one else, for miles around. The sand is smooth, wet, and scattered with giant starfish and dozens of sea urchins.Abruptly, the sun vanishes and a murk creeps in. Charlie hurriedly lights his stove, showing us how to fillet the seabass in the shallows. As he rustles up lunch we notice his pop-up kitchen is getting closer to the water. The tide is coming in already. Our sandbank island is shrinking.We move the kitchen 50 yards from the sea. It only gives us 10 minutes. The tide seeps over the sand and Charlie blowtorches the locally caught seabass for his take on “fish and peas and ham with a Masala flavour”. It’s delicious, and there is just enough time for a quick game of cricket. Salford is afloat again, and suddenly looking a long way away. Storm clouds build in the Wash’s huge skies.We swim-wade hurriedly back to the boat, and head home. The sea has turned choppy, the breeze gets up, and we fly past Scolt Head Island as sandwich terns e into the water and emerge, in a twinkle, gobbling silver fish.Rain arrives just as we enter the sanctuary of Wells harbour, sailing smoothly up the channel on a rising tide.This surreal day does not feel dangerous in such capable hands. Instead, the grand peaceful arena of this coast is profoundly soothing. And the wilderness of its salt marshes is nothing compared to the wilderness out there, among the sandbanks and cormorants, a strange liminal landscape where sand meets sea and the tide is the master of all.• The Coastal Exploration Company offers bespoke sailing adventures on the north Norfolk coast.

Jenji Kohan talks binge-watching, Love Island ... and giving Joey VDDeep into the new and final season of Orange Is the New Black, the groundbreaking Netflix show about life in a women’s prison, a character slumps in front of her TV, engrossed in Love Island. “I got obsessed with it,” explains Jenji Kohan, the woman who has been at the helm of OITNB for the last six years. “A friend who is British introduced it to my life last year, and I got unhealthily involved.” And so she wrote it into her series, giving her obsession to one of the characters, where it appears in the background like a branded water bottle.Kohan does very few interviews – “I chose to be a writer for a reason. I don’t particularly want to be in front of the camera, so to speak” – but she is funny, dry-witted and very frank. So much so that she ends our conversation with a wistful: “I hope I didn’t say stupid things that will bite me in the ass later.”After seven seasons, Orange Is the New Black is bowing out. It is easy, in the age of “peak content”, when TV appears close to offering something for everyone, to forget how revolutionary it was when it first appeared in 2013. Kohan took a prison memoir by Piper Kerman and turned it into an ambitious comedy-drama about incarcerated women. It told us rich stories of poor women, rich women, straight women, gay women, trans women, black, white and Latino women. Its cast, unable to locate the mythical makeup store to which most TV prisoners seem to have secret access, were careful to look the part. The show seethed about injustice, but its comic touch meant it rarely, if ever, tipped into agitprop.When it started, it was only the third series Netflix had ever made, after House of Cards and Hemlock Grove. Kohan had just finished working on Weeds, the suburbs-skewering show about a drug-dealing housewife that had been transformative in its own way, but HBO and Showtime both declined OITNB. “I was pissed Showtime didn’t pick it up,” says Kohan. “I had just given them eight years of a show. What do you mean, you won’t do my next project?” But Netflix greenlit a whole season, without the traditional testing ground of a pilot. “God bless Netflix.”Streaming was in its infancy then, and the idea of Emmy nominations for anything you couldn’t watch on an actual television was unimaginable. But Kohan swiftly realised that the real shift was the advent of binge-watching. “I was, and remain, somewhat conflicted about that,” she says. “Although it’s completely hypocritical, because I indulge in it!” She binge-watched Fleabag recently (“She did a wonderful job – it’s great”), but she has always been motivated by the idea of bringing people together: “When shows came out at the same time for everyone, they could make these connections. I mean, look what happened with Game of Thrones.”Even so, binge-watching is here to stay. “I can lament the water-cooler conversation not happening, but you know, we cannot put the genie back in the bottle.” Hang on: isn’t OITNB, and therefore she, at least a little to blame? “I’m not taking personal responsibility!” she protests. “It’s the streaming services’ fault.”Kohan, 50, grew up in Los Angeles. Her father, Buz, is a TV writer and producer of variety shows her mother, Rhea, is a writer and actor, and her older brother, David, created Will \u0026amp Grace. It seemed pre-ordained that Kohan would be a writer, too, but she has previously called her first job – in the writers’ room of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the early 90s – “a rough and fascinating entrance into the business”. In 2016, she told a festival her nickname there had been “white devil Jew bitch”.She spent the next few years moving from show to show. Name any of the most iconic series from the last three decades, and it’s likely Kohan wrote for it. She had stints on Gilmore Girls, Sex and the City and the first series of Friends. “I gave them a lot of stuff. There was an episode I wrote that they put someone else’s name on after my draft, which, fine, it was the politics of the time.” What happened? “It was the one where Joey was the poster child for VD,” she says. “Look, I’d be much wealthier if I’d stayed on Friends. Ultimately, I was very young, I talked a lot, maybe I said the wrong things, or didn’t play well with others at that point. But you know, fuck them for firing me and taking a lot of stuff I did early on.”When Showtime picked up Weeds in 2005, Kohan was more than ready to be the master of her own ideas. Showtime trusted her to be a showrunner where others hadn’t given her the chance, though she took a pay cut to work there, moving from network to cable TV. “I was trading money for freedom. I was making a whole lot more money in network, but was very unhappy creatively. I was like, all right, pay me like shit, but I will not compromise because this is my shot.” Weeds was a hit, but she had to fight for it all the way.The final season of OITNB weaves in storylines centred on female genital mutilation, post-traumatic stress disorder and outrageous immigration policies, finding comedy as well as drama in all of it. There’s a #MeToo storyline, though typically, Kohan’s thoughtfully contrary approach points our sympathies in unexpected directions. Its sensibilities never appear to have been watered down. “I don’t pull my punches. There are enough points of view in that show that if you’re offended by something, you’ll like something else.” She grows more animated. “I’m not responsible for other people being offended. It’s a TV show – shut it off.”One of Kohan’s most notorious storylines involved her killing off the eminently popular Poussey, in a scenario that had echoes of the case of Eric Garner, the black American choked to death by a policeman. Poussey’s death remains the most upsetting moment in OITNB’s history, and fans were outraged. “You’ve spent so many hours consecutively with these people, in your home, near your body, like, they’re in you,” she says. “It’s gotten so intimate and all-consuming that when things happen, people take it really personally.” I ask if the backlash surprised her. “No! I mean we’re provocateurs, to a certain extent. I want people to have reactions. I want people to talk about things they like and don’t like and feel outraged by and feel comforted by.”When OITNB started, Kohan called its lead, Piper Chapman, the show’s “Trojan horse”. She was a wealthy, white woman who found herself incarcerated for a historical drug-related crime, an “easy access point”, Kohan said, for the stories of the other women in prison. Would she need a Trojan horse now? “Probably not as much,” she says. “Television is becoming more naturalistic in how it represents the world.” She will accept that OITNB should get some credit for that, but also nods to Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes, “for her casts that, in a very natural way, presented all sorts of people”.Although Kohan is meant to be resting after wrapping OITNB, she has instead been working on Glow, the show about female wrestlers in the 80s, and the forthcoming and brilliantly named Slutty Teenage Bounty Hunters. Her production company has given her a new role: “I’m Mary Poppins. I’m taking care of other people’s children. I am supervising and ushering and godmothering a lot of projects that I find really fun, helmed by people I think are great.”She recognises that television now is very different to when OITNB began, and she is frustrated by the current vogue for grimness. “I’m fucking done with darkness and dystopia. I think it’s bad for us at this point. I want to see more reflections of lives we would like to live and worlds we would like to see. The dark is getting me down.” Partly, she says, that’s why OITNB had to come to an end. “When you’re writing a show in prison, you’re psychologically in prison for a good deal of time. It was time for release.”Even so, she says it has been very hard to let go. She misses the characters already. “I’d like to think that in some alternate universe they go on, that the stories continue.” There’s probably some fan fiction online that caters to that. “And probably some excellent erotic fiction,” she says and laughs. “But I have not gone down that rabbit hole. It was bad enough with Love Island.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e220aa981e5f548df80bc25ac8d79bd3101e5f28/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4751c80c0cd1acd576847237c704d34f","title":"uk us europe shipping strait of hormuz","story":"Aim is to create international mission to safeguard shipping through strait near IranThe UK has invited military representatives of the US, France and other European countries to a meeting in Bahrain on Wednesday in an attempt to create an international mission to safeguard shipping through the strait of Hormuz.Britain hopes it can act as bridge between the US – which has the largest military presence of a western nation in the region – and countries such as Germany, which is reluctant to getting involved in any mission led by Washington.Whitehall sources said the British proposal to create a European-led mission to prevent future tanker seizures by Iran was still alive despite the dismissal of Jeremy Hunt as as foreign secretary in Boris Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle.But they conceded its success would be dependent on the involvement of the US, “whether at the head of or in support of the mission”. The US’s Fifth Fleet, responsible for the Gulf, is based in Bahrain.Two weeks ago Iran seized a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero. Tehran said the tanker had cut off its communications system. The UK said it was seized illegally in Omani waters.The seizure demonstrated the difficulties that Britain has in protecting its shipping in the strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes through.Although a Royal Navy vessel – the HMS Montrose – was in the region trying to protect British shipping, it was an hour’s sail away when the seizure occurred. A second British ship, the HMS Duncan, has been sent to the Gulf, but the ships are trying to cover a range of 19,000 nautical miles.The Iranian seizure came after the UK seized an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar that Britain said was bound for Syria in defiance of EU sanctions.British officials argue that other European countries should get involved in an international naval mission that has latterly been an Anglo-Iranian dispute because “they have skin in the game” given the importance of the continuity of oil supplies. The meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday afternoon and is not expected to lead to an immediate outcome, British officials have indicated. They said proposals would be taken back to national governments for further discussion.Separately, the US embassy in Berlin confirmed it had formally asked Germany, as well as Britain and France, to join it in a naval mission in the Gulf, which could form part of the UK-led efforts.Diplomatic sources said the statement was an attempt to put pressure on Germany to become involved. “We’ve formally asked Germany to join France and the UK to help secure the strait of Hormuz and combat Iranian aggression,” said a US embassy spokesperson in Berlin.The embassy added: “Members of the German government have been clear that freedom of navigation should be protected … Our question is: protected by whom?”There is considerable opposition among Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partners in Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, to getting involved in a US-led mission.“The German government has already rejected participation in the US military mission, Operation Sentinel, to protect shipping in the strait of Hormuz,” said Nils Schmid, a foreign affairs spokesman for the SPD parliamentary party, in an interview with Stuttgarter Zeitung. “It should stay like that. Otherwise, there is a risk of being pulled into a war against Iran on the side of the United States.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76e7858245d665308923fced4c284c0565c0b2f/74_0_1243_746/master/1243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ac387e7588a93cd5bcbb0e9534c7c9","title":"canada manhunt suspects were let go after being stopped at checkpoint","story":"Murder suspects Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky were pulled over and searched by First Nation safety officers checking for alcoholThe manhunt for accused killers Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky in northern Canada has taken another frustrating turn, with authorities confirming the duo was stopped at a checkpoint but then let go.The pair, who are suspected of shooting dead Australian tourist Lucas Fowler and his American girlfriend Chynna Deese along with Canadian botanist Leonard Dyck, have been on the run in northern Canada for two weeks.Hundreds of Royal Canadian Mounted police officers using drones, helicopters and sniffer dogs have been searching a remote part of northern Manitoba for eight days after sightings of the pair.But it emerged on Tuesday that McLeod, 19, and Schmegelsky, 18, were chased and stopped by Split Lake First Nations safety officers in Manitoba last week after they drove through an alcohol search checkpoint. But the teenagers had not yet been named as suspects.“These two iniduals kind of drove through the check stop where we had the two constables follow them into the community and stop them,” Nathan Neckoway, the band councillor of the Tataskweyak Cree Nation, told Canada’s CTV News on Tuesday.Alcohol is banned in the area.When a search of the car did not find alcohol, McLeod and Schmegelsky were allowed to continue driving.They apparently then drove 90km west to Gillam, crashed their Toyota RAV4 on a gravel road, set fire to it and vanished.The teenagers told the officers who stopped them that they were from British Columbia.The search of the car did not find weapons, but maps and camping equipment were sighted, he said.Neckoway said “it was quite shocking” when the officers later realised the teenagers were fugitives.Police believed they were closing in on the teenagers on Monday when two people matching their descriptions were spotted near a garbage tip in the remote indigenous community of York Landing in Manitoba.They are believed to have driven 3,000km to the province from British Columbia where Fowler, Deese and Dyck were found dead.But police pulled out of the area on Tuesday after failing to find any trace of them.“A search of the York Landing area, which included the use of helicopters, drones, military resources, and door-to-door canvasses, has been completed,” the RCMP said in a statement. “RCMP is unable to substantiate the tip that the suspects had been in the area.“The heavy police presence in York Landing has been withdrawn and policing resources in the community is back to normal.”The RCMP also said officers had completed more than 500 door-to-door canvasses in Fox Lake Cree Nation and Gillam, and admitted “it is possible the suspects inadvertently received assistance and are no longer in the area”.The Royal Canadian Air Force continues to assist with the search.“Investigators have now received over 260 tips in the past seven days,” the RCMP said. “None have established that the suspects are outside of the Gillam area.”McLeod and Schmegelsky are wanted for the suspected murders that began on July 15 when Mr Fowler, 23, from Sydney, and Ms Deese, 24, from North Carolina, were found shot dead on the side of a highway. They had been on a road trip to Alaska.Four days later, Dyck, 64, was found dead on another highway.McLeod and Schmegelsky, from Vancouver Island, quit their jobs at Walmart and told family they planned to drive to Yukon to find work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854a160e9f2ddbf7002c3a18a34fab923a1d404f/0_234_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b0863cc48cbf2a0344dd1e82b19484f","title":"a load of hot air ballooning world record attempt in pictures","story":"More than 400 hot air balloons attempt to break the simultaneous takeoff world record in the Grand Est Mondial Air Ballons festival at Chambley-Bussières airbase in eastern France "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3972377.1564518454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"review supports need for continuous assessment in leaving cert say principals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn  interim report into a review of the senior cycle indicates a strong desire for the  Leaving Cert to be assessed on a staggered basis instead of facing a single set of summer exams. Photograph: David DaviesPA Wire Secondary school principals say the findings of a review into the senior cycle support its calls for including continuous assessment as part of a reformed Leaving Cert.On Tuesday, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published the findings of its interim review of the senior cycle, based on consultations with more than 2,500 students and hundreds of parents and teachers across 41 schools.Many also say the structure of senior cycle should be made more flexible, with exams spaced out and a much broader array of assessment methods such as projects, teamwork and portfolios.There is also an appetite to introduce successful elements from transition year, such as work experience or life skills, into senior cycle.No consensusThe review indicates there is little consensus on whether to reduce the number of subjects students are required to study or to end compulsory Irish.Many students supported an end to compulsory Irish, with many complaining that they felt overwhelmed or ended up being “taught to the test”.Others stakeholders, however, warned that cutting the number of subjects could undermine the compulsory nature of Irish.The review also highlighted many perceived strengths linked to the current senior cycle.Teachers and parents, for example, placed a high value on having a system of assessment at senior cycle which is widely viewed as objective and fair.Clive Byrne, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said the interim report echoes his own group’s findings that there is a strong demand for continuous assessments as part of the senior cycle.He said the report highlighted the challenges, such as high stress levels and rote-learning which are linked to the high stakes exam.The fact that the credit-based assessment, project and practical work had been highlighted as a positive aspect of the Leaving Cert Applied was significant, he said.“What is important now is that people recognise change is needed, and that it is the education sector that is starting to explore genuine practical solutions,” Mr Byrne said.“We have seen some changes over the last number of years, most recently the two-day extension to the Leaving Certificate timetable to ‘ease pressure’ on students, but we are determined to continue this conversation continues and the NAPD intend to lead the voice for change.”ConsultationsThe NCCA said a new phase of consultations over the senior cycle has now got underway and will run until November of this year.It says this will help formulate “priority areas” including advice on the pace and scale of developments and longer-term goals for the evolving development of senior cycle education in IrelandOnce discussed and agreed by NCCA council, an advisory report will be issued to the Minister for Education. However, it could take a long period of time before any changes are implemented.The report also indicates a strong desire on the part of teachers that any reforms to senior cycle should be externally assessed rather than marked by teachers.This issue became a major stumbling block to reform of the Junior Cycle and led to long-running industrial relations issues with teachers’ unions.A major concern which emerges in the review is the effect of the points system on teaching and learning .Many schools stated that reforms would not be effective without changes in the higher education entry process."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3972402.1564521187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"south dublin trees and gardens could be saved under new busconnects design","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of Kimmage Road Lower in Dublin. File photograph: David SleatorThe  Front gardens and trees in south Dublin could be saved under new BusConnects designs that restrict cars in Kimmage Village.The National Transport Authority (NTA) has produced a new public realm design for Kimmage that would eliminate the need to annex parts of front garden and fell trees, following protests earlier this year by residents.However, it would have to introduce two “bus gates” to Kimmage Road Lower, banning through-traffic for a 2km stretch, to ensure buses were not caught in jams.The original plans for the number 11 core bus corridor involved the widening of lower Kimmage Road south of Sundrive Road from two to four lanes, to accommodate a dedicated bus lane and general traffic lane in each direction.The plan would have resulted in the felling of mature trees, and the removal of on-street parking and parts of front gardens would have been required to accommodate the extra lanes.The NTA has put forward new designs, that include additional tree planting, the removal of some parking, the reduction in speed to 30kmh, and the widening of footpaths, but retain only two traffic lanes.Bus gatesTo achieve this, general traffic would be restricted by bus gates at the junction of Kimmage Road and Harold’s Cross Road near Harold’s Cross Park and south of Kimmage Village, near the junction of Terenure Road West. This would mean commuter traffic could not use Kimmage Road Lower as a direct access route to and from the city centre, but local traffic could use side roads to reach the centre of Kimmage.The NTA said the bus gate would be governed by signage, but it would consider seeking camera enforcement if the system was not respected.Fianna Fáil city councillor Deirdre Conroy said while the NTA had gone to more effort than previously, it did not appear there were sufficient improvements for cyclists, as they would be sharing the bus lane. Businesses in the village would also be losing some parking outside their premises.Displaced trafficThere was also a risk of a “log jam” of displaced traffic on to neighbouring roads, particularly Clareville Road and Larkfield Park, she said. However, of greater concern, was that the impact of the nearby bus corridor on Crumlin residents had not been addressedm she added.A spokeswoman for the NTA said not all corridors provide the “space or opportunity for large scale public-realm enhancements”.

Revisions follow vigorous local objection to the first  planJoan Duffy has lived in Stoneybatter, north of the Liffey in Dublin, all her life. “Something has to be done,” she says. “Manor Street as it is, is too busy. It’s a nightmare during the day – too much traffic goes through it.“They’re never going to make everyone happy at the end of the day – it’s impossible. We do need a better bus service. We do need less traffic here, and if it was only one-way it would limit probably some of the traffic.”Under a new BusConnects plan produced by the National Transport Authority (NTA), Stoneybatter’s walkers and cyclists will be better off , but motorists will face a 3km detour.“I guess there’s a little bit of a question around whether the first plan was just almost intentionally so bad that we all had to go ‘Wow’ and accept the second proposal,” jokes Kaethe Burt-O’Dea of Bí Urban on Stoneybatter’s Manor Street.The revisions follow vigorous local objection to the first BusConnects plan. “I definitely think things are changing in terms of organisations, including Dublin City Council, listening a little bit better,” says Ms Burt-O’Dea. PedestriansStoneybatter is very well served with public transport, she says. “But for two hours a day it clogs up. I think a one-way system could be brilliant.”Allowing more room for pedestrians would “do our businesses a lot of good”, she adds.Fiona Quigley is on a quick visit to the village. “I came whizzing down in my car – down in five minutes, park there and then whizz back up. So those days will be over,” she says. Nevertheless, she backs the BusConnects plan.Local cyclist Joseph Ormond is delighted with the new plan: “More bicycles, less vehicles – I think it’s much better,” he says. “I have nothing to complain about it. I think it’ll really improve the situation of the neighbourhood.”Ruth Henshaw of Top to Toe salon on Aughrim Street questions the logistics of this plan. “I don’t think it’s viable for Aughrim Street to carry the main load of traffic – it’s only a small street.”Her main concern is that “the local community would be affected because there’ll be no access for people to drive down, park the car and get their bits done in their local shops”."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?North Korea fires two short-range ballistic missiles in bid to stop drillsHong Kong protesters clash with police as 44 activists charged with riotingStopping statins treatment in old age increases heart attack risk by nearly half, major study warnsBritain seeks to unite Europeans over Iran\u0026#39s threat to shipping in Strait of HormuzEngland\u0026#39s medieval sport of jousting will introduce hawk-eye technologyInvest billions to restore pride in overlooked communities after Brexit and reap \u0026#39electoral idends\u0026#39, Joseph Rowntree Foundation tells BorisRape victims drop complaints as they are told to hand over therapy notes to prosecutorsAll schools in knife crime hotspots should get dedicated police officers, say MPsUncle Vanya, Theatre Royal, Bath, review: Rupert Everett brings a Wildean touch to Chekhov\u0026#39s tragic heroFacebook is threatening to hinder police by increasing encryption, warns Priti PatelBoris Johnson says UK could stay in EU customs union and single market for two years after Brexit deadlineComment: Facebook\u0026#39s encryption could stop our police doing their job properly -

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

However, the ­details surrounding the order, ­including to whom it applies, cannot be reported.The children are living with their mother in her £85 million home in Kensington, west London. The princess has applied successfully for them to be wards of court, and any decisions about their ­future cannot be made without the approval of the presiding judge, Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the Family Courts Division.Princess Haya, 45, attended the first day of the preliminary hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. It is the first time she has been seen in public since she left her family home in the Gulf \u2028last month.Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Princess Haya bint Al Hussein attend Derby Day at Ascot in 2016In what is likely to be one of the most expensive child welfare cases in British family court history that may reveal how women are treated in the Dubai royal household, Princess Haya sat next to her lawyer, Baroness Shackleton, and stared intently, listening to proceedings.Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, 70, the founder of the Godolphin horse racing stable and thought to be worth £9 billion, is not in court but is represented by Lady Helen Ward, a family and orce lawyer.He and his estranged wife are both friends with the Queen, due to their shared love of horses.A court order is in place which means the names, ages and gender of their two children and details of the case cannot be reported. However, according to the Government’s website, the “forced marriage protection order” the princess is seeking for one of her children is commonly used to prevent someone “threatened with a forced marriage” leaving the country.The former Olympic equestrian, who became the sheikh’s sixth wife in 2004, was said to have flown on a private jet to Germany, before making her way to the UK. While the exact details of why she left are not known, some have said it stemmed from the earlier treatment of two of the sheikh’s princess daughters who also tried to flee.Princess Latifa, 33, ran away from Dubai last year to try to seek asylum.Princess Haya bint al-Hussein greeting Queen Elizabeth II in 2016 at Royal AscotHowever, she was seized off the coast of India by commandos and returned to Dubai. She recorded a video before her capture in which she warned her life was a sham and claimed she had suffered abuse. In December last year, Princess ­Latifa was pictured alongside Mary Robinson, the former president of ­Ireland and friend of Princess Haya, in the Dubai family home in what was largely seen as a publicity stunt.In 2000, Princess Shamsa ran away from her father’s estate near Chobham in Surrey. It is believed she was later abducted and returned to Dubai.It has been claimed Princess Haya, the half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, fled Dubai because she learnt “the truth” about Princess Latifa.The sheikh, the vice-president and prime minister of the UAE as well as leader of Dubai, is said to have 23 ­children by his different wives.A poem recently appeared on his ­official Instagram page thought to have been written by him which accused an unnamed woman of “treachery and ­betrayal”.The judge on Tuesday allowed the ­media to report how Princess Haya had applied for wardship of their children, as well as for a forced marriage ­protection order and a non-molestation order.Rejecting an application by Sheikh Mohammed’s lawyers for those details to be subject to reporting restrictions, Sir Andrew ruled that “there is a public ­interest in the public understanding, \u2028in very broad terms, proceedings that are before the court.”North Korea fires two short-range ballistic missiles in bid to stop drillsHong Kong protesters clash with police as 44 activists charged with riotingStopping statins treatment in old age increases heart attack risk by nearly half, major study warnsBritain seeks to unite Europeans over Iran\u0026#39s threat to shipping in Strait of HormuzEngland\u0026#39s medieval sport of jousting will introduce hawk-eye technologyInvest billions to restore pride in overlooked communities after Brexit and reap \u0026#39electoral idends\u0026#39, Joseph Rowntree Foundation tells BorisRape victims drop complaints as they are told to hand over therapy notes to prosecutorsAll schools in knife crime hotspots should get dedicated police officers, say MPsUncle Vanya, Theatre Royal, Bath, review: Rupert Everett brings a Wildean touch to Chekhov\u0026#39s tragic heroFacebook is threatening to hinder police by increasing encryption, warns Priti PatelBoris Johnson says UK could stay in EU customs union and single market for two years after Brexit deadlineComment: Facebook\u0026#39s encryption could stop our police doing their job properly - and I won\u0026#39t allow that to happenSuspect arrested in murder of 24-year-old Russian Instagram influencer found stuffed in suitcaseBrecon by-election: Did PM Johnson flinch from the first test of his \u0026#39Boris bounce\u0026#39?Comment: Boris Johnson has had an impressive start as PM but he is about to get a big surprise from the Brexit Party Comment: If the PM wants to save the Union, a radical new plan for a federal UK could be the answer\tEco-activists targeting fossil fuel firm barricade offices of green energy company by mistakeJeffrey Epstein served with fresh court documents alleging rape of 15-year-old girlFormer legal boss Gary Senior accused of trying to kiss a colleague and cover it up\u0026#39Intense downpours\u0026#39 cause flash flooding in parts of the UK as Met Office issues weather warning \u0026#39Liberal paper straws don’t work\u0026#39: Trump re-election campaign raises $500k with embossed plastic strawsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/29/TELEMMGLPICT000189560422_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSYRGcnYRAWy9a1w-mbEQrpfhyHuANl8SSbAeQyxyAwM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"worlds former biggest fishing port became home unhealthiest","story":"In the fishing industry’s heyday, the main thoroughfare near the Grimsby docks, Freeman Street, was buzzing.

That was the highest number since the first three months of 2014.Between the end of the last recession in 2009 and the three months following the 2016 EU referendum, quarterly company insolvencies declined steadily to well under 4,000, but in late 2016 they shot up again to over 5,500. Since then, they have averaged 4,330 per quarter.The Federation of Small Businesses, called the latest figures “hugely concerning”, saying they highlight the strain small businesses are under due to rising employment costs, business rates and uncertainty over Brexit.“There’s a real danger that a chaotic, sudden no-deal exit on 31 October will cause insolvencies to spiral further, meaning a significant hit to UK economic growth,” the\u0026nbspFSB\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerNo-deal Brexit is something smaller firms are “simply not prepared” for, it noted, chiming with analysis by another business lobby group, the CBI. Many smaller firms cannot afford to ert human and financial resources to no-deal planning, the CBI said on Monday. But it also warned that, overall, bigger UK companies are not ready for such an outcome either.The risk that Britain will crash out of the EU has risen since the Conservative Party elected Boris Johnson as prime minister last week.Mr Johnson has stuck to his long-standing message that Britain will leave on 31 October “do or die”, reiterating it again on Tuesday. At the same time, chances of a new withdrawal agreement appear increasingly slim as the EU insists the existing deal cannot be renegotiated.The Insolvency Service data also covers iniduals. The data showed that the number of personal insolvencies fell but, at 30,937, remained high. Quarterly personal insolvencies have exceeded 30,000 since late last year – a level not seen since 2011.Pointing to a similar trend, recent data from the Bank of England revealed that defaults on credit card debt rose in the second quarter at the fastest pace in two years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis also potentially in trouble at another fund he runs: the listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust. On Monday, WPCT\u0026nbspsaid its board will assess “all potential management options” and consider third-party managers.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since then, they have averaged 4,330 per quarter.The Federation of Small Businesses, called the latest figures “hugely concerning”, saying they highlight the strain small businesses are under due to rising employment costs, business rates and uncertainty over Brexit.“There’s a real danger that a chaotic, sudden no-deal exit on 31 October will cause insolvencies to spiral further, meaning a significant hit to UK economic growth,” the\u0026nbspFSB\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Boris Johnson\u0027s cabinet: Who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerJacob Rees Mogg appointed Leader of the CommonsJo Johnson appointed new business and energy secretaryBaroness Evans remains Leader of LordsAmber Rudd remains work and pensions secretaryRobert Jenrick appointed housing and communities secretaryMichael Gove given Chandellor of the Duchy of LancasterSajid Javid  is appointed Chancellor of the ExchequerJeremy Hunt sacked as foreign secretaryChris Grayling resigned as transport secretaryJeremy Wright sacked as culture secretaryKaren Bradley sacked as Northern Ireland secretaryJames Brokenshire sacked as housing and communities secretaryPenny Mourdaunt sacked as defence secretaryLiam Fox sacked as international trade secretaryGreg Clarke sacked as business secretaryDavid Mundell sacked as Scottish secretaryDamien Hinds sacked as education secretaryDavid Gauke resigned as justice secretaryRory Stewart resigned as international development secretaryDavid Lidlington resigned as deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerNo-deal Brexit is something smaller firms are “simply not prepared” for, it noted, chiming with analysis by another business lobby group, the CBI. Many smaller firms cannot afford to ert human and financial resources to no-deal planning, the CBI said on Monday. But it also warned that, overall, bigger UK companies are not ready for such an outcome either.The risk that Britain will crash out of the EU has risen since the Conservative Party elected Boris Johnson as prime minister last week.Mr Johnson has stuck to his long-standing message that Britain will leave on 31 October “do or die”, reiterating it again on Tuesday. At the same time, chances of a new withdrawal agreement appear increasingly slim as the EU insists the existing deal cannot be renegotiated.The Insolvency Service data also covers iniduals. The data showed that the number of personal insolvencies fell but, at 30,937, remained high. Quarterly personal insolvencies have exceeded 30,000 since late last year – a level not seen since 2011.Pointing to a similar trend, recent data from the Bank of England revealed that defaults on credit card debt rose in the second quarter at the fastest pace in two years.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Fasta publicised that the company had a deal with Juventus which stipulated Ronaldo would play for at least 45 minutes and that Ronaldo would hold a fan signing event, Kim told Reuters.Phone calls to The Fasta by Reuters were not answered, while officials at Juventus did not immediately reply to requests for comment.Created with Sketch.

But Real won 1-0 at home and when the teams returned to the Allianz Arena, Guardiola made a fatal miscalculation, leaving his team too open. So Ronaldo destroyed them on the break, scoring twice in a 4-0 win to send Real through to the Lisbon final.It was not his best performance as Real Madrid struggled to break down a tenacious Atletico Madrid side who came within seconds of winning. But even then Ronaldo was there at the end, scoring the confirming fourth goal from the penalty spot, running away with his shirt off.

Ronaldo did not have the best game, bur no one remembers that now.Away at Bayern Munich in the 2017 quarters, Real were struggling and up against it, and only a missed penalty stopped them from going 2-0 down. But the game turned when Ronaldo received Carvajal\u0027s cross, swivelled and volleyed the ball into the bottom corner, a masterful finish. He scored another that night and three more in the thrilling second leg to make sure.Retaining the Champions League was meant to be impossible but Real Madrid did it in 2017 and Ronaldo, of course, was front and centre of the Cardiff final.

So for them it is very painful because they love Ronaldo and want to protect him, but they can\u0027t, given the situation.The Fasta CEO Robin Chang confirmed to local broadcaster SBS that the contract stipulated Ronaldo play 45 minutes and said she found out that the 34-year-old would not take part 10 minutes into the second half.When I went to argue with (Pavel) Nedved, the vice president of Juventus, all he said was \u0027I also wish Ronaldo ran, but he doesn\u0027t want to. Sorry, there\u0027s nothing I can do.\u0027 I was so frustrated, Chang told SBS.The Fasta issued a press release on Saturday saying Juventus did not abide by the terms of the contract. South Korea\u0027s professional soccer governing body, K League, said on Tuesday that it had sent a letter of protest to Juventus for violating the contract.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018That\u0027s why it\u0027s important that devices like iPhones shut down when they detect they have gone over their temperature. But that does not stop it being any more frustrating when it does.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakWhen phones do shut down, they will show an error message that tells their user that the phone won\u0027t work until it has cooled down again.iPhones are made\u0026nbspto operate between zero and 35-degrees Celsius. That measure refers to the temperature around the phone, however, rather than the phone itself – meaning that they may shut down more quickly even if the ambient temperature is lower, and might not do so immediately even when the weather is a little hotter.If a phone is left out in the sun, for instance, it will get warm much more quickly and might shut down. And by the same measure, if it is able to cool in a hot room by being left out on a cold surface, it might be able to keep running even when the outside temperature would appear to be too hot.The phones can also be stored in places that are up to 45-degrees celsius, according to Apple. But they can\u0027t be\u0026nbspused\u0026nbspat that temperature, only kept there.Cooling a phone down to make it start working again can be done just like any other object: put it somewhere cool, move it out of direct sunlight, and in extreme cases you can hold it next to something cold like a bottle of water. It can also be useful to take it out of its case, since they can store up the heat and work like a blanket wrapped around it.But it can also be helpful to stop it getting that warm in the first place. That can be done by keeping it out of direct heat, but also minimising the amount of work it is doing on the inside – avoiding intensive processes like playing games, downloading files, and other taxing activities.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As per tradition, one half of the couple was asked to choose whether to take the money for themselves or split it with their partner -- Greg chose to split the £50,000 winnings with Amber.The liveblog is now closedCatch-up: Anton and Belle left the villa last night in final dumping of the showFind out what to expect from tonight\u0027s episode in our previewSee the biggest moments from this series of Love IslandGood evening, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the Love Island final!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt\u0027s going to be an emotional one, not least because I\u0027m so overjoyed at the thought of finally having free evenings each night.

One of those, the furthest from the star, is thought to sit in the temperature range that could allow it to support alien life – but its atmosphere is expected to be so thick and dense that it stores lots of heat, and the surface is probably too warm.Scientists hope to learn more about the relatively nearby worlds. As well as being close by and playing host to such unusual worlds, the star is unusually bright, without the solar flares and storms that can sometimes get in the way of observations.“TOI-270\u0026nbspis a true Disneyland for exoplanet science, and one of the prime systems\u0026nbspTESS\u0026nbspwas set out to discover,” Mr Gunther continued.NasaGoddard Space Flight CentreScott Wiessinger)“It is an exceptional laboratory for not one, but many reasons –\u0026nbspit really ticks all the boxes.”There might be yet more planets in this solar system waiting to be found, researchers said.While the planets are interesting enough in themselves, they also link together in a “resonant chain”, according to the researchers who found them. That means that their orbits are lined up neatly in whole integers, meaning that they are in “resonance” with each other.“For\u0026nbspTOI-270, these planets line up like pearls on a string,” Mr Gunther\u0026nbspsaid. “That’s a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical\u0026nbspbehaviour. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.”Other solar systems have been found with planets that line up in these “resonant” formations. In our solar system, the moons of Jupiter are lined up in this interesting way, too.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis also potentially in trouble at another fund he runs: the listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust.

small electrical current could\u0026nbspslow down the ageing process for over-55s by rebalancing\u0026nbspthe nervous system, according to research.Scientists found stimulation of the vagus nerve, which connects to the body’s nervous system, can lead to improved quality of life, mood and sleep.The small research study, conducted at the University of Leeds, involved delivering a short daily therapy of a small, painless electrical current to the ear over two weeks.Its findings, which were published in the journal Aging, suggest that the therapy may slow down one of the important effects of ageing and help people to grow old\u0026nbspmore healthily.Researchers said this could help to protect people from chronic diseases associated with old age, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and atrial fibrillation.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Residents follow

metabolic balance, without the need for medication or invasive procedures,” said lead author Dr Beatrice Bretherton from the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Leeds.\u0026nbsp“We believe these results are just the tip of the iceberg.”Poor sense of smell in old age linked to early death, study saysHowever, further studies are necessary to understand the long-term health effects of the therapy.The nervous system, which controls processes such as digestion, breathing and blood pressure, has two branches – the sympathetic and parasympathetic – that work alongside each other to keep the body healthy.When people get older, the balance of these two branches shifts as the sympathetic branch, which prepares the body for high intensity “fight of flight” activity, becomes dominant over the low intensity parasympathetic.How to take decades off your biological ageKeeping fit: how to do the right exercise for your ageRegular cinema trips could help guard against depression in old ageKey symptom of old age reversed ‘surprisingly easily’, study findsThis\u0026nbspimbalance\u0026nbspmakes older people more susceptible to new diseases and leads to the breakdown of healthy bodily functions as they age.Scientists have previously found that stimulation of the vagus nerve at the ear, which some people say feels like tickling, can improve the balance of the nervous system in healthy 30-year-olds.The new University of Leeds study discovered an increase in parasympathetic activity and a decrease in sympathetic activity after the therapy, bringing the nervous system into a healthier balance.\u0026nbspResearchers also found iniduals who displayed the greatest imbalance at the start of the study experienced the most pronounced improvements after the therapy.The study was conducted by scientists from the University of Leeds and funded by the Dunhill Medical Trust.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this

Previous studies had suggested that it formed about 150 million years after the solar system.The discovery could also help us understand just how old our own Earth is.The new research is published almost exactly 50 years since humanity walked on the Moon for the first ever time. As astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz\u0026nbspAldrin\u0026nbspdid so, they gathered up vast collections of samples, so they could be used to understand not only the history of the Moon but also of our Earth and the other planets that surround us.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

That threw out material into Earth\u0027s orbit, which gradually formed into the Moon we can see today.But in its early state, it looked very different, covered in an ocean of magma that formed different kinds of rock as it cooled and became solid. Researchers can therefore look at the nature of those rocks in an attempt to understand how the Moon was formed, by examining the chemical makeup of the samples.We are missing an opportunity to change way we think about the moonSuch observations are not possible on Earth anymore, as our planet has been geologically active over time, said\u0026nbspPeter Sprung, co-author of the ne study.\u0026nbspThe Moon thus provides a unique opportunity to study planetary evolution.The researchers were able to look at the variety of different rare elements that could be found in the lunar samples, to help them see how much melting had to happen to make the patterns that are visible on the surface today. The researchers then looked for trends and patterns among those rocks, helping them understand how those rare elements behave.Two of those rare materials –\u0026nbsphafnium and tungsten – are useful because they work as something of a natural clock: they decay reliably, so can be used to track time. That decay only lasted for the first 70 million years of the solar system, and helped show that the Moon had already started to solidify as soon as 50 million years after the solar system began.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That movement in turn creates a magnetic field around the Sun, but far enough away the pull of that magnetic field is weak and plasma breaks off the Sun and flies through the solar system.Nasa discovers planet unlike any ever seen in our solar systemThe researchers aren\u0027t able to directly see that happening. But they created another, much smaller ball of plasma – in a lab, and named the Big Red Ball.The solar wind is highly variable, but there are essentially two types: fast and slow, explains Ethan Peterson, a graduate student in the department of physics at UW-Madison and lead author of the study. Satellite missions have documented pretty well where the fast wind comes from, so we were trying to study specifically how the slow solar wind is generated and how it evolves as it travels toward Earth.The Big Red Ball is a sphere that has a magnet in its middle. Gas is pumped into it and made into a plasma, which can then be hit with an electric current that makes it behave like the Sun.The researchers can then study that small version of the star from various points, giving them a three-dimensional picture of what that activity looks like.It allowed them to watch small versions of the spirals and burps that are thrown out of the Sun. Researchers already knew that it threw out plasma periodically from satellite images – but the new researchers were able to learn more.These ejections are observed by satellites, but no one knows what drives them, Peterson says. We ended up seeing very similar burps in our experiment, and identified how they develop.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We must ensure that we do not stand by as advances in technology create spaces where criminal activity of the most heinous kind can go undetected and unpunished.“Indeed, making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world.”Industry representatives – including executives from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter – agreed to collaborate with member states on a set of voluntary principles to combat child exploitation, including the live streaming of abuse.The principles are due to be finalised by the end of September.Meanwhile, a set of five commitments for the Five Eyes states were agreed by ministers.They included sharing learning on cyber threats, ensuring security in 5G networks and creating a stronger approach to the misuse of drones.They also committed to exploring enhanced cross-border information-sharing and to maintain efforts to combat foreign interference in elections.Additional reporting by PAThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even the most extreme proponents of Brexit, like Nigel Farage, promised we’d get a deal from the EU.”According to Google Trends records, the earliest flicker of interest from the search engine\u0027s\u0026nbspusers in no-deal came in the weeks before Theresa May struck her ill-fated withdrawal agreement with the European Commission in November 2017.But records suggest that searches did not begin in any number until July 2018, when Boris Johnson and David Davis walked out of her cabinet in protest at her deal.There is evidence of continued interest in no-deal from that point onwards, with spikes in activity around the time of Ms May’s abortive first attempt to win MPs’ support for her plan, followed by the three “meaningful votes” in which the House of Commons rejected it.During the fraught weeks before the original Brexit date of 29 March, searches for no-deal from the UK even briefly outstripped those for stars like Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian.Another smaller spike has been seen in the week of Mr Johnson’s arrival at 10 Downing Street, with searches for no-deal\u0026nbspmore than doubling on Google in the course of a week.The People’s Vote campaign released a dossier highlighting numerous occasions during the referendum when key Vote Leave figures now installed as part of Mr Johnson’s government insisted that the UK would easily be able to strike a deal with the EU.Mr Johnson himself - then the figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign - said in 2016 that the UK would “seek a new relationship” with the remaining EU after Brexit and that a free trade arrangement on goods and services would be struck “very rapidly indeed”.Michael Gove, now charged with leading preparations for no-deal, said that a new settlement with the EU could be “easily concluded” and suggested that referendum voters had an opportunity to opt for a deal with “all the advantages and none of the pay-outs”.Vote Leave supremo Dominic Cummings, now Mr Johnson’s senior adviser in Number 10, spoke in evidence to a Commons committee of a “gradual” move to a new relationshipAnd Mr Raab said in the weeks before the referendum that the UK would “cut a very good deal” and the idea that Britain would head over a cliff-edge after voting Leave was “silly”.Even after the referendum result was in and the UK had sent the Article 50 letter which triggered Brexit negotiations, Mr Johnson as foreign secretary played down the prospects of departure without an agreement, telling parliament in July 2017: “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.”Mr Thomas said: “This dossier compiled by the People’s Vote campaign and research by The Independent reveal in devastating detail that no-one on the Leave side was really talking about no-deal - and it certainly wasn’t what people voted for.“If the Prime Minister now tries to impose this disastrous outcome on the country without the people’s voice being heard, he will be disgracing our democracy.“There is no democratic mandate for no-deal. The only way to deliver a lasting and legitimate solution to this Brexit crisis is to give the public the final say.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant using WhatsApp on computers would require users to link it to the original device\u0027s account.The new upgrade will mean WhatsApp will work in a similar way to other apps like Facebook, where users can use the same login details across devices, download standalone versions of the app on any and all of their devices and have messages sync between them all.The latest WhatsApp rumour comes courtesy of WaBetaInfo, who claim the new capabilities are currently under development.Created with Sketch.12 useful WhatsApp features you didn’t know existed Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.You can unsend a message by tapping and holding it, hitting the Delete symbol and selecting Delete for Everyone.

It’s just insane.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This goes well beyond Yemen’\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentTens of millions of people could lose access to clean drinking water if a decaying oil tanker moored off the coast of Yemen is left to collapse or explode, experts have said.The Yemeni state-owned vessel Safer, which holds over one million barrels of crude oil, is stationed permanently around five\u0026nbspnautical miles off the rebel-held port of Ras Isa.Since the late\u0026nbsp1980s, it has served as an offshore oil storage platform, and is directly connected to a\u0026nbspnearby pipeline in the\u0026nbspcentral Yemeni province of Marib. But since war erupted in Yemen in 2014, few maintenance crews have been given access to the 43-year-old ship. Last week, the United Nations said the Houthis\u0026nbsphad once again barred experts from assessing the vessel.Experts now fear that\u0026nbspthe buildup of volatile gasses released by the oil could cause a huge explosion, or the corrosion to the vessel\u0026nbspcould see it completely disintegrate – both\u0026nbspleading to one of the world’s largest oil spills.\u0026nbspYemen’s recognised authorities told The Independent they had submitted multiple urgent appeals to the UN to pile pressure on the Iran-backed rebels.In a new evaluation of the impact of such a disaster, experts at IR\u0026nbspConsilium – a consultancy focusing on maritime law and security – warned that any such incident would force multiple desalination plants across the surrounding Red Sea area to shut, depriving millions of access to drinking water.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Food aid for Yemenis stolen Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People walk in a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.People stand near their rooms inside a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.A baby sleeps inside a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.A woman sits with her baby inside a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen, in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.Sisters play in their room at a shelter for displaced persons in Ibb, Yemen in this 3 Aug 2018 photo.The entrance of the hangar of the United Nations in Aden, Yemen, in this 23 July 2018 photo.A man sells aid supplies at a market in Aden, Yemen, in this 23 July 2018 photo.The entrance to the port where aid is received, in Aden, Yemen, is shown in this 23 July 2018 photo.This 24 July 2018 photo shows a gas station on a road in Shabwah, Yemen.

The Atlantic Council lists the UAE\u0026nbspembassy in the US and the British Foreign Office among its major donors.Mohammed al-Hadhrami, vice minister of foreign affairs for the recognised Yemen government, said the authorities were making urgent appeals to the UN and other international bodies.\u0026nbsp“If something happens to the tanker it would be a problem for the whole region –\u0026nbspeven the world,” ambassador al-Hadhrami told The Independent, calling it “an ethical obligation for the UN” to act.“We don’t want to see it get that far. No one knows the full potential of the spill, if it happens it would set a precedent in the region. This goes well beyond Yemen,” he added.The Houthis could not be immediately reached for comment.There are quite a few plants\u0026nbspand having one or more shut down due to contamination from an oil spill could have dire consequences for the region’s people, millions of whom are already on the brinkBefore the conflict, the tanker had acted as a\u0026nbspstorage facility\u0026nbspfor the main Marib-Ras Isa pipeline in Yemen, which\u0026nbsphas no onshore facilities in the area.The ship now lies along a part of coast controlled by the Iran-backed Houthis, who want guarantees that they will have access to the revenues of the oil, thought to be worth $80m (£65m).The cash-strapped rebels swept control of the country in late 2014, forcing the recognised Yemeni president Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi to flee.Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies launched a bombing campaign in the spring of 2015 to reinstate their ally Mr Hadi.\u0026nbspFour years on there is little hope of an end to the fighting.The tanker is so contentious that\u0026nbspit was named in a\u0026nbsppeace agreement signed by both the Houthis and the Saudi-backed recognised government in Stockholm last year, involving withdrawals from key Red Sea ports.But so far peace talks have stalled and the last time a maintenance crew was given access to the tanker was two years ago.UAE confirms pull back in Yemen war but won’t withdraw completelyGovernment bids to resurrect ‘unlawful’ arms sales to Saudi ArabiaYemen cholera outbreak hits over 200,000 children in 2019 Corbyn condemns May after meeting with ‘war ally’ Saudi princeBAE denies it has any responsibility to investigate Yemen atrocitiesIR\u0026nbspConsilium said that earlier this year the vessel was so corroded that a piece of it fell off – fortunately missing the submarine pipeline that feeds it.The pipeline may contain another one million barrels of oil, which could also be dumped into the Red Sea if the vessel collapses, doubling the size of the oil spill.\u0026nbspAt least in terms of numbers of barrels, it is akin to when Saddam Hussein dumped millions of barrels in the Persian Gulf in 1991.\u0026nbspNo one knows the full potential of the spill, if it happens it would set a precedent in the region. This goes well beyond YemenHe compared the devastation to a recent diesel spill off the coast of Patagonia which made international headlines despite only involving 250 barrels of fuel.“If the Safer were to leak all its oil, the spill would be over four and a half thousand times larger – and that’s the Safer alone, not the submarine pipeline that connects with it,” he said.Dr Ian Ralby who also worked on the report said that despite the alarming potential consequences of the spill, the crisis “has not inspired sufficient action”.He warned of the violence that would likely ensue from lack of access to drinking water, as well as the effect of the spill “global marine bioersity, the loss of livelihoods and food sources from the degraded marine environment, and the threat to coastal tourism”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some may not even bother.Godparents play an important role in christenings, according to Church of England Christenings.In the christening service, you will make some big promises to support your godchild throughout their le, the website states.They often bring the infant to the font to be baptised and in countries such as Latvia, it is the godparents who also choose a name for the child.Christening gts are traditionally silver, such as a silver spoon or rattle but here, too, this tradition is fading and all kinds of presents can be given."},{"url":null,"title":"bob geldof gary lineker tony blair cant stop brexit","story":"Not the democracy-denying weasels in the House of Commons.

So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris.

They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo.

But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of .

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in. He attempted to eclipse her huge achievement and make it all about him.Plus, he put her in a very dficult position. I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was heartbroken.Born the same size as his dads hand, just a ninth of the size of the average male baby weight - Jadens parents said they were heartbroken by the news that he might not make it.Professionals at the Iowa Methodist Medical Centre said that babies born that early are often not fully formed, do not have the full use of their limbs and are not able to breathe unassisted.But Jaden came out swinging his arm and screaming at the top of his lungs, according KCCI.He also took to breast milk immediately, doctors calling this remarkable.Proud mum Ellonn told Today: His arms and toes were moving and he was trying to breathe on his own.Hes our little miracle.The couple havent been able to hold their son yet bu they visit him every day as he lies in an incubator.They hope that he will continue to gain strength and will be home by his official due date on November .Ellonn told KCCI: I go in and talk to him, and I tell him that Im proud of him every day.Taking to Facebook to share her sons journey, she wrote how he had  bloody transfusions in the first week of his le, and she admitted that some days have been a struggle.Since his birth, hes had a small infection, but overall doctors say hes doing well, according to Today.Ellonn, who also has a three-year-old son, Elijah, has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for his medical bills.On the site she wrote: Ive heard them use terms like amazing and remarkable to describe me so far - not bad for someone under  pound, huh Jaden continues to fight at Blank Children’s Hospital in Des Moines."},{"url":null,"title":"carl beech trail of destruction","story":"Had the men he accused of abusing him really been guilty of the crimes alleged, they would have received sentences at least as long — and spent a letime on the sex offenders register.It seems appropriate that someone guilty of ly alleging such disgusting crimes against people who had never harmed him should be punished in a similar way.That said, I can’t help feeling that Beech has been left to carry the can not only for his own despicable behaviour but also for the police officers and others who indulged him in his tall stories.Even after it should have been obvious that he was lying, these officers have subjected those he accused to public humiliation and shame.While Beech has rightfully been jailed, not one officer has been made to answer for their failings.As retired judge Sir Richard Henriques, who investigated Operation Midland — the investigation into Nick’s allegations — in , explained yesterday, the politan Police are not merely guilty of allowing themselves to be fooled by Beech but they may have broken the law, too.In order to gain a warrant to enter the homes of Lord Bramall, Harvey Proctor and Lady Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Brittan, the Met mistakenly told a judge that “Nick’s” allegations had been consistent.As we now know, there was nothing consistent about Beech’s fantasies. It was clear he had never suffered the injuries he would have suffered had he really been subjected to the acts he claimed had been committed against him.He had never been absent from home or school at the time he claimed he had been abused.Moreover, there was no trace of the two children who Beech claimed had been killed by the supposed paedophile gang.Surely these are the first checks which should have been made before police started raiding the homes of suspects.If there is no sign that the murder “victims” had ever existed, that should have set a very loud alarm bell ringing in the ears of police investigators.Yet on they ploughed, driven by the perverse doctrine that anyone who alleges that they have been a victim of sex abuse must automatically be assumed to be telling the truth.That doctrine was a magnet for fantasists such as Nick, who gain a thrill from putting innocent people through the mill — and who stand to pocket a fortune in compensation.Why on Earth was Beech paid £, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board before his allegations had been tested in court The top brass of that organisation need to hang their heads in shame.Many people are going to be asking: Just how much more taxpayers’ money has been merrily handed out to “victims” who have been telling fibs Sir Richard has demanded a criminal investigation into the Met decision to raid suspects’ homes without proper evidence.But even without that element of the story, it is a disgrace that no police officer has been investigated for misconduct.Instead, those in charge of the investigation have been rewarded. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway was promoted to superintendent while under investigation for alleged misconduct in the case, and retired just before Beech’s trial.Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald — who infamously described “Nick’s” allegations as “credible and true” — also retired on a gold-plated pension before the Beech trial began.Ex-Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse, who oversaw Operation Midland, has been booted upstairs to a plum, £,-a-year job at the National Crime Agency.Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been rewarded with a peerage. What an utter farce his elevation makes of the honours system.Sir Richard said the Met has “sought to protect itself from effective outside scrutiny” over Operation Midland, and claims that during an investigation he oversaw into the operation in , the Met failed to pass on all the relevant documentation.He added: “I remain unable to conclude that every officer acted with due diligence and in good faith.”But most contemptible of all, in a way, is the behaviour of Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson.Without Watson, it is unlikely that Beech’s allegations would have been taken so seriously.It was Watson who invited Beech to his Westminster office, who stoked the political heat and put the pressure on police to take Beech’s allegations far more seriously than they deserved.And what has been his reaction since Beech was found guilty last week  Not to apologise but to claim, preposterously, that he, too, was a victim of Beech’s. Rubbish, Mr Watson.You seized on “Nick’s” allegations because you could see the political dynamite of a case which involved a former Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and ex-Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.The main victims of Beech are, of course, the men he ly accused of forming a paedophile ring, but we should not forget another class of victims — those genuinely abused and who now might be shy of reporting the crimes against them for fear of being taken to be another Beech.That is part of the long trail of destruction caused by the fantasist. But it was not him alone who deserves to take the rap.Police officers, Watson and the chiefs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board bear a heavy responsibility for what has happenedOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Children playing in the street witnessed Leanne, , Louise, , and Samantha, , shouting and screaming at their victim, the Liverpool Echo reports. However, the three single mums walked free from Liverpool Crown Court after the judge ruled that their imprisonment would cause signicant harm to their children.    Prosecutors said there was a dispute between the sisters and the paternal gran of Samanthaaposs children, Deborah McKenna, over a dog. They said Ms McKenna and her son Thomas Carson had made reports to social services about the welfare of children, but no action was taken. Paul Becker, prosecuting, said it later involved Katie Cunningham, the girlfriend of Mr Carson, and Mr Taylor, a friend of the McKenna family. He said all parties on both sides of the dispute were warned by a housing association about their behaviour before the incident, on August  last year. The Whelan sisters said they were driving to their mumaposs when they saw Ms Cunningham outside Mr Carsonaposs house in Alwen Street, Birkenhead. Prosecutors accepted it was a chance encounter but they got out of a silver Mercedes and shouted come on letaposs go before Leanne got a hammer. Ms Cunningham fled into the house but Mr Taylor, who was in the back garden and heard shouting, came out to investigate. Mr Becker said the sisters shouted to Ms Cunningham and Ms McKenna to come out, but Mr Taylor told them to calm down. He said: Samantha Whelan was abusive and said aposf*** off, we donapost want you. Mr Becker said Mr Taylor stood his ground and Leanne swung the hammer, missing his upper body, during chaotic scenes. He said: Leanne Whelan was seen to be bouncing towards Mr Taylor, threatening and generally acting aggressively. Mr Taylor was shocked and scared. Mr Becker said the victim backed off and the sisters walked away but were all shouting homophobic comments about Mr Taylor. He said they also made threats to Ms Cunningham, screaming youaposre getting this over your head. Mr Taylor said he was left feeling depressed and anxious, looking over his shoulder all the time and struggling to sleep at night. The Whelan sisters said the victims were lying and claimed to have alibis, before admitting threatening behaviour ahead of a trial. Leanne, of Treetops Drive, Bidston, who has five previous convictions for  offences, also admitted possessing an offensive weapon. Her criminal record includes assaulting a police officer, common assault and assault causing actual bodily harm.    Andrew McInnes, defending Leanne, said an allegation was made that Ms Cunningham assaulted one of the sisters the previous day. He said remorseful and embarrassed Leanne was a good mother to her children, aged seven months, three and . Mr McInnes said both Leanne and her two eldest children had dficulties, but she had since avoided the victims and planned to leave Birkenhead. Louise, of Wakefield Drive, Leasowe, has  previous convictions for  offences, including racially aggravated harassment against a supermarket security guard. Anna Duke, defending Louise, said her client had two daughters, aged seven and nine, who suffered from ADHD and dyspraxia. She said a medical report found Louise could be very impulsive and lacked thinking skills, but she had signed up for counselling. Samantha, of Tollemache Road, Oxton, has three previous convictions for assaulting a police officer, battery and shoplting. Bernice Campbell, defending Samantha, said she had a daughter, , and son, aged four, who was awaiting an assessment for autism. She said: Samantha Whelan has been a victim herself, calling the police after she got beat up in front of her four-year-old child. Judge Gary Woodhall said Mr Taylor was subjected to homophobic abuse and the sistersapos emotions got out of control. He said: It appears the background to this offence was either a falling out over a dog or allegations of sexual impropriety and the like. Whatever it was, it led to a dispute between extended family members and tensions increasing up to the day of this offence. Clearly issues were ongoing for some time. Various complaints were made to social services including about the welfare of children. All parties involved - both sides - were warned about their behaviour by a housing association. Various allegations made to police were not prosecuted. Whatever the rights and wrongs of this dispute, itaposs clear to me by August  last year, you three resented the way things had not been investigated or not prosecuted, you three resented the way the witnesses in this case behaved, and you were angry and upset.

Local campaigners believe that Davies was only selected to give the party an excuse should they lose the seat on Friday morning.  But defeat here would send the Conservative majority to just one seat, just a week after Mr Johnson became PM. So here is everything you need to know about the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection:When is the byelection     This Thursday,  August. Polls are open from am to pm.    Why are we having a byelection  The election was triggered after Tory MP Chris Davies was unseated by a petition that followed his conviction for a  expenses claim.

In March, Davies, , dodged jail and was fined £, and ordered to carry out  hoursapos community service after he admitted giving  information for his Westminster expenses - filing  invoices - to pay for photographs in his office. The seat was won by the Tories at the last election, but Davies looks like he will struggle to retain it.  Davies has apologised, saying: If you look at the technicality here there was no financial gain. Clearly the authorities have been through my accounts and everything Iaposve done with a fine-tooth comb over the last four years, and that was the only mistake they could find, he added.

Labour, who came a distant third in previous elections, have seen their vote squeezed by the Lib Dem insurgency - with senior party officials worried they could lose their deposit. He old the Mirror that austerity, not just Brexit, were the defining issues in the election. He added: After a decade of cuts people are struggling. “I met a woman working five jobs just to get by. “And the Tories and Lib Dems don’t have the answers.” Despite a tough campaign, which could see the party pushed into fourth by the Brexit Party, Mr Davies has said there was clearly an appetite for Labour in Brecon and Radnorshire and a socialist option on the ballot. It is a four-way split andenough people donapost just vote to keep the Tories out but for what we want then we could wind this.    Liberal Democrats Odds of winning -    Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds, , is a child-protection social worker. Her campaign are quietly confident that they will win back this seat - which was previoulsy held by the Lib Dems in before . “To voters here Westminster can feel a million miles away,” Ms Dodds told the Mirror. “They don’t feel listend to and No Deal is just part of that”.  Her route to victory was made easier after the decision by both Plaid Cymru and the Greens not to stand against their candidates rival Remain party.    The LibDems have ditched the brash “Bollocks to Brexit” slogan from their European election resurgence - but the campaign is still dominated by Europe.Ms Dodds added: “ Boris Johnson has made a last-minute dash from the ivory tower of Westminster to talk to people here.“He thinks that is going to work.

WhatsApp, iMessage and other popular services are so well encrypted even the tech firms can’t read customers’ messages.It follows a meeting of security chiefs in London today, hosted by new Home Secretary Priti Patel, which called for tech giants including Facebook and Apple to allow Governments to obtain “readable” messages from their customers.The group also discussed the row over whether to allow Chinese firm Huawei to provide equipment to power Britain’s G networks. The US has already banned Huawei from providing kit for their G rollout, over fears their close links to the Chinese government could pose a security risk.    While not mentioning Huawei by name, the group discussed the risks of “unauthorised access or interference” in new G networks, including by “foreign governments.” The group agreed to perform an “evidence-based risk assessment” on the issue.The meeting of security ministers from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance is Ms Patel’s first major act as Boris Johnson ’s Home Secretary.The Five Eyes, which includes Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - evolved from a secret World War Two alliance between British and U.S. code breakers.    Ms Patel said: “The Five Eyes are united that tech firms should not develop their systems and services, including end-to-end encryption, in ways that empower criminals or put vulnerable people at risk. “We heard today about the devastating and lelong impact of child sexual exploitation and abuse and agreed firm commitments to collaborate to get ahead of the threat. “As Governments, protecting our citizens is our top priority, which is why through the unique and binding partnership of Five Eyes we will tackle these emerging threats together.”  Donald Trumpaposs attorney general, William Barr, was among those attending the talks. He added: “Encryption presents a unique challenge. We must ensure that we do not stand by as advances in technology create spaces where criminal activity of the most heinous kind can go undetected and unpunished. “Indeed, making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world. We are grateful for the leadership of Home Secretary Patel in facilitating these critical discussions and shared commitment to safety for all.” End-to-end encryption means messages can only be decoded by the sender or recipient. They use a publicly available algorithm to scramble and unscramble the message on the phone itself, rather than the encryption being done by the service provider. The upshot of this is that Apple, WhatsApp, Telegram and other services that use the technology could not decrypt messages sent through their servicesthey wanted to.

They began saving the £, needed for the journey, and even moved in together to save money on rent.  months later they headed off, cycling through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America.    The couple, who are based in Edinburgh, Scotland, even got hitched half way through the trip in a romantic ceremony in Yosemite National Park in Calornia. Helen, a social media coordinator, said: We just thought: aposWhataposs stopping us  We could do it, couldnapost we apos Neither of us were happy in our jobs. There was literally nothing stopping us and all we needed was bikes, money and the determination to do it. Mike, a solicitor, had a photo of him standing in Yosemite on his Tinder profile. His bio said that this le goal was to cycle the world.    When Helen matched with him in January , her first message was: When are we leaving  She said: My first message, before I even introduced myself, was, aposWhen are we leaving apos. Mike replied: How about Tuesday  The couple soon arranged their first date. Mike said: We jokingly chatted about our cycle journey and the route we would take. It was a good way to flirt. But by their second date, the couple realised they were completely serious about the expedition. Helen had cycled theof the UK by herself the year before and Mike had done extensive bike trips in Canada and North America. Helen said: It felt like we had known each other for a long time. We just clicked.    The couple estimated that the trip, including bikes, insurance, flights, visas and spending money, would cost around £,. They planned to camp as much as they could, only splashing out on hotelsthere were no camping sites available. They immediately began to save money, cutting down on all luxuries. We spent no money at all, Mike said. We sold all our valuables, we moved in together after five months to save rent, we didnapost go out for drinks. We would maybe buy a £. bottle of wine once a week. Then I got an evening job working in a restaurant and Helen transcribed legal and medical documents at night to earn more money.After  months, the couple had stockpiled enough cash and in April  - a Tuesday - they set off. We wanted to go on a Tuesday because thataposs what Mike suggested in our first Tinder exchange, Helen explained. We left Glasgow and cycled to Newcastle to catch the ferry to Amsterdam. Once we were in mainland Europe, we felt like we had really begun. They cycled through Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria. They then cycled through Turkey and into Georgia, before flying to Beijing. The pair pedalled for two months across China, then along the coast of Vietnam to Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore before flying to Perth, Australia. They spent three months biking through the southern and eastern coast of Australia before flying from Brisbane to Calornia. In April  they tied the knot in Yosemite in front of their parents and two friends from the UK. Helen said: We were together for  months when we got engaged in November . We always wanted to get married in Yosemite and we started planning the wedding when we were in China. Mike added: It is one of the most beautul places in the world. It was my profile picture on Tinder so it felt right that we got married there. Helen and Mike singled out cycling along a , mile stretch in Australia as the most intense bonding experience on the trip. Our biggest bonding challenge was cycling across the Outback, said Mike. Thereaposs a section that joins Eastern and Western Australia. Itaposs a road that is  miles long and thereaposs just about nine gas stations, thataposs it, thereaposs not even a bench.Thereaposs a -mile stretch where the road doesnapost bend or go up or down a hill - itaposs a straight line into the wind. For five months they travelled in countries where most people did not speak English and they could only speak to each other. She said: That was a big test. We knew we could get married at that point. After the wedding, the couple headed north to Salt Lake City, Utah.    However, as they left the city, tragedy struck. Newlywed Mike collapsed with hypothermia. A storm came in and Helen watched in horror as Mike weaved along the hard shoulder of the interstate highway. She said: His features were contorted into a screaming cry, his eyes were shut and his mouth was wide open. She flagged down a car and the driver called an ambulance. Paramedics treated Mike with heated packs and, once his temperature was back to normal, he was discharged. The couple decided to drive on to Denver, Colorado, but once there Mike felt well enough to get back on to his bike. They cycled into Canada and then flew to France, ing home in August  by way of Switzerland, Luxembourg and Belgium. The Brexit vote reduced our spending power so we had to cut our trip short, said Helen. We missed out on New Zealand.The couple had dficulty adjusting to le back home when they ed. It was really hard, Helen said. Part of me was glad to have a rest from cycling, it wasnapost like I still wanted to do it every day. We missed that freedom though. When we were on the bike all we had to worry about was what we were going to eat, where we were going to sleep and where we were headed.

This is just one of the unsavoury sights in a tourist hotspot where drugs and gang warfare are exposing British families to a murky world of danger. This is Marbella – a haven for celebrities, and a top destination for Brits wanting to rub shoulders with the super-rich in the Spanish sun. But behind the facade of super­yachts and fast cars, ruthless gangs linked to Russia, Morocco and Col­­ombia have moved in for a slice of its multi-million pound drugs trade.    Our investigators headed to the glitzy Puerto Banus marina, where owners of luxury yachts moor for €, a day. Overlooking it are two vastly dferent worlds. Calle Ribera faces directly onto the ocean, with designer shops and trendy bars and restaurants that are packed out until the early hours. A favourite haunt of celebrities since the s, it is a firm favourite with the cast of TOWIE and is a great place to spot a footballer. Even here, not everything is as it seems. A waitress from Scotland, working in a bar for the summer, told us: “It’s full of fakers, so many ten bob millionaires who pretend they’re rich for a week in the sun. “But there’s a hell of a lot of real cash too, usually the quiet ones.”    But less then  yards back from this strip lies an altogether more seedy one, known to the Spanish as Calle del Infierno – “Hell Street”. Within a minute of moving from one to the other, Mirror reporters were offered cocaine and sex. A Romanian girl calling herself Lisa sidled up and offered sex for € in a nearby apartment block. “Come on, honey,” she urged. “I don’t have all night. I’m very popular but there’s lots of us to choose from.” In the course of the evening we counted at least  young women walking up and down, approaching any man who made even the slightest eye contact. The drug dealers too operate in a similar way – all within full view of the police, who did not seem to bat an eyelid.  Offering a gramme of cocaine for €, dealers assured us they could get any other drug within moments. Much of the action appeared to centre on infamous nightclub The Navy Bar. Once inside, it quickly becomes apparent it is a magnet for prostitutes looking for rich visitors. Within seconds, the Mirror reporters were swamped by women openly offering sexual services, from as little as € up to €. One told us: “This is just the day job. There are so many men with money here, why wouldn’t we come out to play  Once we leave here we’ll just go on the streets – they’re everywhere. This is Marbella, baby.” More worrying, though, is the rise of gangs that has seen an escalation in violence and a spate of murders.

The age of consent in the Sunshine State is -years-old while teenagers can drive at . The shocking details emerged in a Palm Beach Police Department probable cause affidavit in which several of billionaire Epstein’s victims and staff were interviewed under oath. The hedge fund manager, who is now in a New York correction centre awaiting trial for underage sex trafficking, was  at the time he sent the girl the flowers.    Alfredo Rodriguez, who worked as a butler and chauffeur and managed Epstein’s Palm Beach residence, told detectives he was like a “human ATM machine” and had been told to maintain a minimum balance of ,cash at all times to pay the girls. The former employee, who has since died, told Palm Beach police visitors appeared “too young to be masseuses,” adding they even ate like school children. “Rodriguez stated they would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time,” the affidavit said. Evidence suggests Epstein knew his victims were schoolgirls and the signs didn’t escape staff at the Royal Palm Beach High close to his home.  The girls endured taunting, and classmates called them “prostitutes.” After two girls fought, an administrator found one of them had in her purse. According to the affidavit: “Hestated one time under Epstein’s direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that provide a massage.” But when askedhe thought the scores of girls visiting Epstein’s home were underage he told police they appeared too young to be masseuses. He then told how Epstein ordered him to hire a car for the victim.    “On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought roses to so that she could drive herself to Epstein’s house without incident.” Rodriguez told police routinely wiped down Epstein’s sex toys following the visits, according to the police report. He said he provided iPods, jewellery and other gts to the girls. The affidavits were in  when Florida police were investigating Epstein. Despite detectives found more than  alleged victims, he pleaded guilty in June  following a two-year investigation to just one count procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution by minors.

Ellonn Smartt, , from Des Moines, Iowa, was due to give birth on November , but on July  her waters broke. She was rushed to hospital where doctors told her they needed to perform an emergency C-section.“They said I was going to have to deliver in the next day or two and there was a good chance he wouldn’t survive,” Ellonn told Today.“That was the moment when I fell apart.” The heartbroken mum knew she needed to do everything in her power to stay calm so the baby wouldnapost be harmed.   And shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ellonn and partner Jordan Morrow welcomed their baby boy named Jaden Wesley Morrow. He weighed just  ounces - around the same size as his dadaposs hand. The average weight of a male baby born at full term is  pounds,  ounces.The newborn is now fighting for his le in intensive care but is growing stronger every day. I knewI panicked, the baby would pick up on that and get stressed, said Ellonn, who also has a three-year-old son. I couldnapost let that happen.  Although the parents haven’t been able to hold their baby boy yet because he’s still in an incubator, they “go in and talk to him, and I tell him that I’m proud of him every day. Little Jaden will be discharged from hospital on his November  due date. “For most part, Jaden is stable,” Ellonn said. “He’s on a ventilator and had a small infection, but his doctors think he looks great. He’s getting breast milk and gaining weight.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/KCes_Murraygate_High_Street_Phone_Boxes_Dundee_090719-14.jpg ","title":"abandoned arcade on dundees reform street to be reborn as series of retail units","story":"A long-abandoned arcade in Dundee city centre is set to be reborn as a series of retail units, pending approval by city planners.Hynds Amusement Arcade was snapped up by local property firm West One Property in January for a reported £,.West One has now submitted its redevelopment plan to Dundee City Council for review, with a decision expected in September.Lee Chadwick, director of the firm, wants to ide the large space into three retail units to attract new tenants.He said: “We hope to seek approval to split the building into three normal-sized units.“The unit currently is too large – it is laid out to maximise floorspace which is useful for an arcade.“By splitting the units it opens up the property to multiple uses.

That allowed us to build up attacks and play a lot of the game in Chikhura’s half.”Ojo, who played for the entire  minutes in Tbilisi, is set to retain his starting spot against the Georgians in theleg at Pittodrie on Thursday.Bryson is also moving closer to being in contention to start.McInnes said: “I thought Ojo would be able to do  minutes, maybe  in Georgia and he did really well.“Bryson came on earlier than we would have expected, but he used his experience throughout the night.”Aberdeen face a defensive crisis for Thursday’s clash as centre-backs Ash Taylor and Mikey Devlin are both ruled out with hamstring injuries.Left-back Greg Leigh faces a fitness battle to recover from an ankle injury sustained in a pre-season friendly that has ruled the summer signing out of all three Euro ties so far.As the Dons face a defensive injury problem, the club are also braced for further bids for centre-back Scott McKenna.Aberdeen rejected bids of around £ million from Championship outfits QPR and Nottingham Forest.It is understood Forest will come in with an improved offer for the -year-old, who was the subject of a rejected £.m bid from Aston Villa last summer.Aberdeen value McKenna at £m and an approach before Thursday’s tie would not be welcome."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/5d3ac431479602.81990551-441x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home 28july1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home This gorgeous girl is Lexi, who is five-and-a-half years old.This smiley girl loves company, and would like someone at home with her most of the day who she can follow around the house or garden before heading out for a walk exploring and snfing everything.She is not good around cats or small children.Are you an experienced owner who could give this girl the care she needs Zena is five years old and has a mischevious nature.She has been around other dogs previously, but is not suitable to be homed around cats or young children.Zena can be quite the independent girl and will soon let you knowshe doesn’t want to do something.She will need a new owner who has experience of huskies and their sometimes stubborn, strong-willed nature.Bonnie lass Lexi is nine years old and is full of le!This girl loves attention so is not suitable to be homed around children or other pets.Lexi doesn’t have good recall when off the lead so this is something a new owner will need to take into consideration, especially when around other dogs.She is a friendly girl who could be the right companion for you!Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"eight month adventure for mo and the chicks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFancy going on a round-Britain tour with your family Travelling and sleeping together in a  Morris Traveller van That is exactly what the Chick family from Sussex # Mum Jem, dad Dave and children Gracie , Evanand -year-old Irys # have done.Oh # and they are doing it on just a tenner a day.Ten pounds to spend on fuel plus food and everything  a family of five needs.The Morris Traveller is known as Mo, and she was adapted four years ago by Dave helped by Evan.The Chick family#s aim is to raise money for CatZero, a community-based charity in Hull helping anyone in need turn their lives around by giving them the skills and opportunities they need to build a brighter future.Gracie explained as they arrived in Lochgilphead: #We#ve done around , miles of an estimated ,-mile journey starting in Hull and going anti-clockwise all the way round the mainland coast.It will take the family around eight months to complete their trip, and they were on day  since leaving Hull on May .The school term is not a problem as the children are home-schooled.The ten pounds per day is split evenly between food and fuel, which allows them to move around  miles each day.#With a bit of ingenuity and creativity, it#s easier than you#d think,# said Jem.#We eat a bowl of water porridge with salt in the morning and then lots of couscous, rice, pasta, chilli, soups and stews .#People have been really generous and offered us food or invited us for dinner.

They joined Tarbert’s own traditional boats which range from fishing boats and an ex ice breaker for the Royal Dutch Navy to a barge and ex leboat which has circumnavigated the world.This two day festival is a social event with Saturday afternoon given over to family fun. The pontoons saw a steady stream of locals and visitors who took the opportunity to talk to owners and find out the history of their boats.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

It is because of what has happened in the  months between the original consultation closing and this announcement.We have seen a massive increase in hostility towards trans people, and conversations that seem to indicate that a vocal minority are much more concerned with trying to reduce our existing rights and social acceptance, rather than constructive dialogue about gender recognition reform.Read more:Trans Scots suffering abuse in wake of GRA debateIt is our sincere hope that as with the Equal Marriage legislation, this consultation focuses on the technicalities. There will be plenty of areas up for discussion: how long should a trans person have been living in their gender before they are eligible to apply  Is a period of reflection a useful safeguard  Should applications be limited to over s  We donrsquot believe anyone should be deemed as transphobic for expressing dfering views to our own on such issues.But it is understandable that many fear some people will use this second consultation to oppose trans equality more broadly. The last  years has seen our rights improved based on two key principles: that how the government and services treat trans people must reflect our lived identity, not the bodies we were born with, and that trans people deserve adequate privacy about our gender history. Newly championed calls to insist we must disclose our biological sex at birth in all circumstances totally undermine existing UK law, and the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights.Read more:Scottish Government accused of pandering to bigots over GRA delaysTrans people are not being unreasonable in objecting to such attempts to roll-back our existing rights. Being trans does not make someone delusional, a paedophile, a homophobe or a misogynist and calling us those things is not reasonable debate.At just .% of the population, and with no trans MSPs or senior journalists, trans people feel powerless within a moral panic over our existence.

Receptionist: She is Scottish. Patient: She doesnt look Scottish. Receptionist: What do Scottish people look like  Silence. Appointment card taken. So proud of my team.\"The tweet went viral and Dr Krishan, , received messages from as far afield as Argentina, Colombia, Ghana, India, Canada and Australia. Six months later, she remains blown away by the reaction.\"It had an engagement of . million impressions across the world,\" she says. \"I didnt expect it to be as global. It was such an overwhelmingly positive response.\"Dr Krishan, who works as a GP in the East End of Glasgow, has gained a raft of followers who enjoy her warmth, candour and thought-provoking posts on social media where she is an impassioned proponent about the importance of kindness.\"I always say to my medical students and trainees that learning the science is the easy bit,\" she says. \"We can learn from textbooks, absorb the knowledge and spout that out. But it means nothingit is not delivered with compassion and care.\"It is a theme we come back to several times in our conversation. Hearing Dr Krishan talk about her love of being a GP, it is hard to believe she almost never took that path.The eldest of two daughters, she grew up in Glasgow and describes herself as being \"raised on curry and Irn Bru\". Her Indian-born parents arrived from Punjab in the late s. \"We grew up in my dads corner shop,\" she says. \"It was ingrained in us that education was the key to freedom. You were either going to be a doctor, lawyer, accountant or a failure.\"Medicine became an early front-runner thanks to her childhood family GP. \"He was very much a role model for me from a young age because he was the core of our community,\" she says. \"Everyone knew thatDr Kauser saw them, they would be OK.\"A seed was planted for the future Dr Krishan. \"I loved the idea of being able to help and heal people in a community setting,\" she says. \"I admired him and knew education was a must, but then I hit school and everything I loved was wildly dferent to the sciences.\"I enjoyed history and language and music and drama. I wanted to study English Lit, but I was edged into choosing medicine. My mum couldnt understand why I wanted to study English or drama.\":Why we love Glasgows street artHer mother would regularly walk past the University of Glasgow, gaze longingly at its towering spire and tell her daughters that they would one day study there. \"It was almost like she manested it,\" says Dr Krishan, a smile in her voice.\"It was one of her unfinished dreams. My mum had an arranged marriage. She was going to study medicine in India but couldnt because she came to Scotland to be married. Both my sister and I went to the University of Glasgow to study medicine. We are both GPs in Glasgow.\"On paper it sounds like a picture-perfect le trajectory, yet Dr Krishan reveals that in her teens, there was a point when she went off the rails.\"I was a nightmare for my mum and dad,\" she recalls. \"Growing up, I was confused about where I truly belonged. Our summer holidays were always spent in India. I had very much my Indian existence at home, but all my friends were Caucasian.\"There were a lot of restrictions and being told: You cant do this you cant do that ndash what will the aunties think  which I found frustrating. I was always testing the boundaries. I got into trouble at school and was suspended on a couple of occasions.\"When I failed all my exams in third year ndash I got straight sevens in my Standard Grades ndash my mum said she was going to send me to India to finish my studies. She had lost hope. I was given one last chance to turn it around. That was a wake-up call.\"Dr Krishan, who attended Notre Dame High School, knuckled down and achieved the grades to study medicine. \"It was after I became a doctor that I started to feel liberated,\" she attests. \"Then I really felt my wings unclipped after I became a mum.\"The birth of her son Aarish, now six, provided another watershed moment. \"I ended up on a ventilator in intensive care,\" she says. \"My family were told that I didnt have long to live. What happened to me was a complete out-the-blue crisis point in le that gives you a scare.\"She had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage. \"It was a freak, bleed-out episode,\" explains Dr Krishan. \"I went into heart and lung failure, developed clotting issues and widespread sepsis.\"Afterwards, Dr Krishan experienced a le-changing epiphany. \"Everybody around me tried to medicalise me,\" she says. \"Everything was about maybe you need this tablet, when actually all I wanted was support and space to heal. I didnt want drugs to do that.\"I started exercising and eating food to nourish myself inside and out. It is amazing what insights being on the other side of that desk can give you. I ed to work a completely dferent doctor.\"Holistic care is something Dr Krishan regularly applies in her work as a GP. \"I see a lot of poverty and patients living in social isolation, as well as drug misuse. It is quite a challenging population but equally it is a place where you can really make a big dference.\"Around  to  per cent of the things I see as a GP are lestyle-related medical problems. It has become my passion to focus more on the lestyle habits that people form, rather than just the -minute appointment model which is: How can I get you in and out  Can I give you a drug \"She takes her patients on \"Lidl walks\" to share tips on what foods to avoid and how to make healthier choices. Last year, Dr Krishan and a colleague set up Glasgow Wellbeings, a public group where they share their \"health hacks\", which has grown to more than  members.Dr Krishan is married to a fellow GP. \"He started off as an orthopaedic surgeon, but you cant live with me and not become a GP,\" she jokes. Her enthusiasm is clearly infectious, then. \"I would sell it in a jarI could.\"She is currently writing a childrens health book and will make her presenting debut in a forthcoming BBC Scotland medical documentary series due out later this year. Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings. I have also lived as a troubled teenager trying to find my identity.\"With this man who was dying of cancer, I was helpless. There was nothing I could do. He knew that and I could see the fear in his eyes. It just felt so intuitive [to hug him] becausethat was my father or grandfather, I would have wanted somebody to reach out and say: Its OK, Im here for you.\"Follow Dr Punam Krishan on Twitter and Instagram at @DrPunamKrishan"},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-opens-scotland-s-biggest-ever-offshore-wind-farm","story":"The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm, located km off the coast of Caithness, will save around eight million tonnes of carbon emissions over  years.The North Sea wind farm, which has been welcomed by environmental groups, was opened by the Duke of Rothesay on Monday.Beatricersquos  turbines will generate MW of energy - enough to power , homes every year, and will play a crucial role in the UKrsquos efforts to combat climate change over the next  years.:Earth Overshoot Day: Weve used up natures  budgetThe pound.bn project is the largest ever single private investment in Scotland and was developed by Scottish-headquartered energy firm, SSE Renewables, along with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Red Rock Power Limited.Construction of the wind farm, Scotlandrsquos single largest source of renewable energy, has provided a pound.bn economic boost to the UK, of which poundbn went directly to Scotland.Jim Smith, managing director of SSE Renewables, said the firm was ldquoincredibly proud of the new development.ldquoWersquore incredibly privileged and honoured to welcome His Royal Highness to Wick today to perform the official opening of Scotlandrsquos largest wind farm, Beatrice, he said.ldquoToday is about celebrating the hard work, innovation, drive and collaboration of thousands of people from across Scotland, the UK and further afield who all played their part in building Beatrice, which is now Scotlandrsquos largest offshore wind farm and the fourth largest in the world.ldquoWersquore incredibly proud itrsquos been delivered on time and under budget, even when dealing with the challenges the North Sea and deep waters bring.ldquoWersquore especially proud of the signicant positive impact Beatrice has already made to the communities of Wick and Caithness, and which will last for decades to come.ldquoThe UK has the biggest offshore wind industry in the world and this world-class offshore project paves the way for future development in Scotland and the UK to help decarbonise our economy while boosting jobs and growth.ldquoMost importantly, Beatrice will save around m tonnes of harmful carbon emissions over its -year letime operation, making one of the most signicant contributions across the UK in combating climate change and meeting our net-zero ambitions.The opening of the wind farm was welcomed by WWF Scotland, who claimed the renewables sector is helping to tackle the worldwide climate emergency.:Earth Overshoot Day is the earliest in historyCharity director Lang Banks said: ldquoScotland is already generating record amounts of power from renewable sources helping us to avoid millions of tonnes of climate-wrecking carbon emissions every year.ldquoThe addition of power from huge offshore wind farms such Beatrice will help us to decarbonise even more of our economy, including our heating and transport sectors.ldquoWersquore in the middle of a climate emergency and renewables will continue to play a critical role in powering the country, creating jobs, and reducing carbon emissions.

There are two logical options to resolve the current stre a new Scottish leader or an independent Scottish Conservative Party.:Nicola Sturgeon accuses Boris Johnson of lacking guts as he dodges protestersRegardless of personalities, an independent Scottish Conservative Party now seems inevitable after Brexit.

Thatrsquos his opinion: the demonstrable fact is that Mr Johnson has been a liar and a cheat does it make it OK that it was done with charisma  And how likely is he to do it again On the same page, Doug Clark adds his weight to the argument. For some reason, he excludes the BBC and press from the media and is unaware that the balance in the written press, overall, is and has been signicantly for Brexit. Can I suggest he checks the research on the EU referendum carried out at the University of Loughborough  However, I suspect that doesnrsquot fit the propaganda he peddles regarding risk to the foundations of our democracy and economy.In my opinion, the damage to our democracy was flamed by David Cameronrsquos priority of the Tory Party over the UK, and the damage to our economy is at the hands of hard-line Brexiters and their desire to leave the EU with no deal but, obviously, thatrsquos not a fact. Propaganda is defined as information that is not objective, using selective facts and loaded language to produce an emotional rather than rational response.Your three correspondents appear keen to follow Mr Johnsonrsquos lead, \"doubters, gloomsters and doomsters\", with their use of propaganda rather than rational argument.

Its cries of doom are not because it really believes no deal would be \"catastrophic\" but simply as an attempt to use fear to prevent us leaving the sclerotic EU at all.

Trade deals can be signed across the world in short order. We save pound billion. Uncertainty is ended, not dragging on for years. The Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy no longer apply ndash the UK Government can support farmers and fisherman in the best way possible. And EU-UK trade would continue as before, not least because the EU sells us poundbn more than we buy from them. That is why the head of Calais port has guaranteed that trade will be unrestricted.

One such rule is to limit the use of I, a rule I have already emphatically broken and that I will continue to do.Among his other preferred rules is that Mr Rees-Mogg requires all non-titled males to be referred to as \"esquire\" as a sign of respect. There is no female equivalent of esquire but one perhaps must only be grateful Mr Rees-Mogg allows use of Ms. So modern of him.It, as an aside, is an apparent benefit of having Meghan Markle join the royal family that Ms seems now to be used. Previously, the royal household stuck rigidly to Miss and Mrs. I - there I go again - attended the Garden Party at Holyrood Palace a few years ago, taking my mother as a guest.I put our details both as Ms Stewart. The Ms was rejected and our invites arrived bearing the honoric Miss. Ma Stewart was quite affronted at having an important part of her le erased so quickly and completely while I was quite affronted at having my feminist gas put on a peep.When asked about his style guide, the Honourable Member said, \"Its just a thing listing banned words, which are sort of New Labour words like unacceptable.\" He went on, \"If something is wrong, say it is wrong.\"Who can argue. Plain speaking is a gt in modern times. We have so much baffling claptrap to wade through that even simple things can become entirely inpenetrable - plain speak away. At the same time, you also find find people with unsavoury right wing views boast about their plain spoken ways. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump both would pride themselves on being such.This is where the gt element comes in. They believe they are being direct by failing to pause before engaging their gobs. This means we have an instructively clear insight into how their brains work, failing to keep their racism and sexism hidden. Useful.And so to the Leader of the House of Commons, a bit of the plain speaking there too. \"Just\" and \"banned words\" is quite the telling coupling. Banning words should never be prefaced by \"just\". A ban requires a robust defence, something Mr Rees-Moggs style guide is lacking.Yet, Im prone to support a style guide. For someone with a love of language, a style guide is one of the delights of working on a newspaper and something precious, to be protected. Choice of language says much about attitude and influence it is also a connection to the past, a thread running down through the years.One of the my favourite parts of The Heralds house style guide is \"Never use a French phrase when an English one will do just as well.\"Rees-Moggs soi-disant style guide makes me wondersocial media could do with a bit of a style guide too. When heated debates play out in the public realm Twitter is the  for much of these discussions.And yet, instead of debate being nurtured and furthered, the letter limited medium of conversation naturally forces people to use shorthands, usually deeply unhelpful shorthands that only silence, or at the very least, stymie debate.Think pro-le as a term for those who are anti-abortion. It doesnt quite cover it, does it  Pro-lers are hardly pro the mothers le. If American and Republican, they can hardly claim to be pro any le once it is out of the womb and isnt white and or wealthy.Its a disingenuous phrase at best and dishonest at worst.The issue of independence has come to the fore again with a Boris Johnson prime ministerial term and a looming Brexit ing the issue to the public domain. Can we drop terms like Yoon, and Nat  No matter what your persuasion, either one prompts nothing but hackles to rise and thats the last thing we need at what is a crunch time for the country.TERF - with regards the trans rights debate - is another one. TERF is a slur. Others say it is not. No matter whether you agree it is offensive, it is a tool for shutting down debate. It is a form of threat.It is almost impossible for these shorthands to be satisfactorily explanatory of a persons beliefs.They then become offensive and damage debate by reinforcing prejudices.It must be possible to have lively, robust debate without reducing peoples views to pitul stereotypes.It must be possible to take the sting out of the worst of Twitter debate by being allowed and able to name our own viewpoints without being thoroughly dishonest about what those viewpoints are.How about: Never use a reductive label when treating people as iniduals will do.How about: drop labels, use respect."},{"url":null,"title":"alastair-campbell-no-longer-wishes-labour-member","story":"Mr Campbell was expelled from the party in May after admitting voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections as a protest and had planned to appeal against the decision.But in an open letter to Mr Corbyn, part-published in the , the former Labour spin doctor has now said, ldquowith some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, evenI should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.ldquoThe culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain, he told Mr Corbyn in the letter, which is also published in full in the New European.Read More:Nicola Sturgeon accuses Boris Johnson of lacking guts as he dodges protestersMr Campbell said he does not blame Mr Corbyn for Brexit, something he ascribed to successive recent Conservative prime ministers and senior Tories, but he said the Labour leader does not understand the gravity of the UKrsquos situation and was likely to lose a potential general election.ldquoI see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it, Mr Campbell wrote.Last week, Mr Corbyn said Labour will ldquocampaign to RemainPrime Minister Boris Johnson puts an unsatisfactory Brexit deal back to the public in a second referendum.ldquoLabour will oppose any deal that fails to protect jobs, workersrsquo rights or environmental protections.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything.

The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches.

And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds. That is not good enough.“Having initiated the consultation, the government now have an obligation to act.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football. And make up your own mind about the glorious bits!Jockie WoodNo customer reviews for the moment.* Required fields"},{"url":null,"title":"terms of service  \n","story":"Terms of ServiceLast Updated:   These terms of serviceapply to your access and use of our apps and websites.

So now is a good time to ask some fundamental questions about what kind of future we want for tourism.A revamp of Edinburgh’s tourism strategy is under way it will be launched in six months’ time setting out actions planned for the coming decade. Are the right questions being asked  Are the voices of citizens and residents being heard CNN Travel recently identied Edinburgh, alongside Barcelona, Venice, Rome and Amsterdam as global “hotspots” for “overtourism”. The helter-skelter, sky’s the limit, tourist boom we are living through represents a considerable success not just for the tourist industry, but also its partners, the Scottish Government and our local city council. Tourism is seen by the Government as Scotland’s most important industry, employing , people, providing one in  of our jobs, though contributing a less impressive six per cent to the national economy. Edinburgh is crucial to Scotland’s tourism. In , the city accounted for  per cent of overnight trips by overseas visitors to Scotland, and  per cent of all overseas visitor spending in Scotland. For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here: Edinburgh’s tourism industry urged to act to avoid ‘backlash’With a   per cent split between visits from March-October and the rest of the year, tourism is also less seasonal in Edinburgh than in rural Scotland. Edinburgh’s  tourism strategy sought to increase the number of visitors to the city by a third between  and , from . million a year to . million.By , it was ahead of that target and the “stretch target” was upped to . million a year. So, simultaneously, Scotland’s tourist industry and the revenues it generates for government are dangerously over-reliant on Edinburgh, but also umbilically tied to the city’s further tourist growth. A policy for tourism in Edinburgh is a policy for tourism in Scotland, and vice versa.Amidst economic uncertainties about Brexit, government and the industry will cling to the comfort blanket of growing tourism in Edinburgh. The plunging pound makes Scotland more affordable for international visitors, but Brexit poses problems for tourist businesses, including visa uncertainties and the end of EU-wide free movement in a sector that relies signicantly on non-UK EU workers, and has a disproportionate percentage of employees earning below the living wage. In addition, the prolonged and continuing period of austerity has drained the capacity of local councils to maintain, let alone enhance, the public realm and its attractiveness, not just to residents but to visitors also. Globally, tourism demand is expected to accelerate in the medium term. Therefore, there are good grounds for expecting the number of tourists coming to Edinburgh to continue to increase, and for businesses and government policymakers to seek to attract new visitors, particularly from emerging economies experiencing rapid growth of middle-class incomes and lestyles.A global economic recession may yet blunt the momentum, but this is the lens through which preparation of Edinburgh’s tourism strategy for the next ten years is being viewed. The work is being led by the Edinburgh Tourism Strategy Implementation Group , which has operated since . Its members include Edinburgh council leader Adam McVey and councillor Donald Wilson, convenor of the Culture and Communities Committee. Then there are three senior officials – the chief executive, Andrew Kerr Paul Lawrence, director of place and Jim Galloway, from economic development. Apart from the director of the National Galleries, the other eleven members are from Scottish or local tourism and marketing bodies, including Scottish Enterprise, VisitScotland, Edinburgh Airport, and industry organisation the Edinburgh Tourism Action Group. Though its built and natural environment is Edinburgh’s major attraction, there is no official from Edinburgh’s planning department on the SIG, nor any representation of the conservation or community bodies in the city.Effectively the industry is in charge of making policy for the city, with planning and citizens consigned to near irrelevance. The city council is there as a corporate entity to help tourist businesses to realise their dreams. A key principle of the SIG is stark: “Decisions by the SIG are made for the benefit of the tourism sector in Edinburgh.” Chaired by the council’s chief executive, SIG declares, without any caveats, that it works by “championing the strategy at a senior level” and “aligning the strategy and member organisations’ activity to be inclusive, complimentary and mutually supportive”.The idea that the city council exists to represent and serve the citizens, rather than to give unconditional support to some private businesses and investors, may seem quaint. Similarly, the thought that the council, as the local planning authority, has a duty to take decisions in the public interest, respect the multiple heritage designations that apply in central Edinburgh, and refuse permission for inappropriate development, sits uneasily with an absolutist pursuit of growth in tourist numbers and the infrastructure of hotels, transport, events etc that such growth requires.These concerns about governance and accountability matter since tourism-driven development in Edinburgh has become fiercely contested, just as it has in those other “over-tourism hotspots”. The fate of the old Royal High School and its setting on Calton Hill now rests with Scottish ministers. Will they allow a large hotel to despoil one of Scotland’s most emblematic cultural assets  The planning permission for another large hotel at India Buildings was strongly opposed by the local Old Town community and others dismayed by its impacts on the Central Library. Loss of accommodation to commercial, short-term holiday lettings, and consequent rent increases, is provoking a backlash.The question that needs to be asked is not “how can we attract as many tourists as possible ” but rather “how can we manage tourism so that it does not destroy our city and communities ”Industry advocacy needs to be balanced against evidence of capacity constraints, and a proper heritage assessment that is taken seriously by officials and politicians.Clf Hague is chair of the Cockburn Association©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit talks with eu on hold as no deal preparations get 1bn boost","story":"The UK government will dramatically increase spending to prepare for potentially crashing out of the EU, including erting # million for an advertising campaign to raise awareness ahead of a no-deal Brexit, it has emerged.Chancellor Sajid Javid will unveil a £ billion boost to spending for no-deal this week as ministers respond to orders from Downing Street to “turbo-charge” preparations.It came as Downing Street confirmed there would be no face-to-face meetings between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders, despite invitations from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, until they agreed to re-open the Withdrawal Agreement and abandon the Irish border backstop.A spokeswoman indicated Mr Johnson believed Brussels would blink first in the Brexit stand-off. “He has been clear that the backstop will be abolished,” she said.“He remains confident the EU will stop claiming that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be changed, but until that happens we must assume there will be a no-deal Brexit on  October and the government’s central focus is preparing for that.”Speaking in Scotland on his first visit north of the Border, Mr Johnson tried to distance himself from comments by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, who said at the weekend the government would “operate on the assumption” the EU would refuse to concede.And Mr Johnson said the UK would be “reaching out” and was “not going to be aloof or wait for our friends to come to us”.But the intensity of the government’s focus on no-deal preparations was confirmed yesterday with the first meeting of a new Cabinet Exit Strategy committee, known as XS, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, but was led in his absence by Mr Gove.Mr Gove will lead another committee on a permanent basis, aimed at providing daily updates on overall Brexit preparations to ministers and officials.The ‘daily operations’ group, codenamed XO, will operate out of the room that normally hosts Cobra, the UK’s emergency situation committee. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab – one of the members of the XS – said the  referendum result was an instruction to leave the EU with or without a deal. “The mandate certainly wasn’t to leave the EUthe EU let us, it was an in out referendum and we made clear, those on the campaign, that we should strive for a good deal, butthat wasn’t available, that we should go on and make a success of Brexit,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.Speaking in Scotland, Mr Johnson said: “My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we’re aiming for a new deal.“But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it’s responsible for any government to prepare for a no-dealwe absolutely have to.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was “disgraceful” to spend the money on advertising for a “totally avoidable” no-deal Brexit while “four million people are in deep poverty”.“Boris Johnson knows no-deal will cost jobs, but the Tories only care about the wealthy elite who fund them,” he said.SNP Treasury spokesperson Alison Thewliss said a £m advertising campaign was a “shameful waste of taxpayers’ cash”. “Boris Johnson has no mandate in Scotland,” she said. “We didn’t vote for Brexit and we didn’t vote for this Tory government.“With public money being thrown down the drain, the Tories must explain why Scottish taxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for a Brexit we do not want.”Mr Johnson’s failure to contact Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar since taking office was branded “discourteous and offensive” by Sinn Fein yesterday.In recent times, incoming UK prime ministers have placed a call with their Irish counterpart on the first day of assuming office.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused Mr Johnson of “snubbing” Mr Varadkar.“I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach,” she said.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry. The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

They are intent on pursuing a strategy to undermine workers’ pay, terms and conditions as well as imposing price hikes excluding lower income users. There is now a substantial two-tier workforce with increasing numbers of casual workers coming in on poverty pay rates while those previously employed by Belfast City Council are being denied pay uplts, leaving their wages fall ever closer to the legal minimum.“The community has been left behind as well. Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres. Council is committed to working with GLL, its employees and their representatives to ensure the continued provision of leisure services to all our ratepayers across Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casement park decision due by the end of year","story":"THE long awaited planning decision for the redevelopment of Casement Park is anticipated to be made before the end of this year. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, following meetings this week with the Department for Communitiesand Ulster GAA, West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that as “far as I can ascertain, all the information required for this project is in”. He added: “I would be expecting a decision on planning before the end of .”The redevelopment of Casement Park has faced several setbacks since it was first announced in December .The then SDLP Environment Minister Mark H Durkan granted planning approval for the £ million ,-capacity stadium, however, a year later a High Court Judge quashed the planning approval following a successful residents’ legal challenge. The judge ruled that the impact of bigger crowds exiting the stadium had not been properly examined. As of February , Ulster GAA have submitted its revised Casement Park planning application with a reduced capacity of ,.Speaking after a round of top level meetings this week, Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News: “I met with the DfC on Monday and I’m in constant contact with the Department for Infrastructurewhose Permanent Secretary, in the absence of a department minister, will make the decision on planning for the project. “I met with the Ulster Council in Armagh on Tuesday, and have been meeting with all the stakeholders with regards to Casement Park for a long, long time.“There are around £ million of additional costs to the Casement Park project due to time delay and change of design. DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailin away on the crest of a wave","story":"TO understand today’s music scene in West Belfast you have to go way back to brass, reed and silver bands. There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37184686.ece/ad059/BINARY/Belfast_Pride_2020_PA.jpg","title":"antrim gaa to take part in belfast pride parade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was upfront and honest, as I have been in my whole career.\"Mr Clarke said that when he set up the business in  he wasnt working as an MLA.\"People come to me for the complete planning package. We organise the plans the drawings and everything ,\" he said.\"The other stuff where they have muddied the waters slightly is where they see this is an MLAs role.\"It certainly isnt. On a monthly basis I represent people as an MLA, there is no money that changes hands, I am happy to do that and I will continue to do that. The other one is distinctly dferent.\"I thinkthe media took time and spoke to MLAs and asked how many of them actually do up the applications, fill in the application forms, do the maps, do drawings and submit all of that for free, I think you wont find that there is anybody that does that. I think it is a bit misleading in the story.\"Asked whether he refuted comments from Sir Alister Graham that the situation may represent a \"conflict of interest\" Mr Clarke said: \"If this former public standard watchdog head is saying there is a conflict, then that needs to be looked at.\"I have no issue with that, butthat is the case, then I wouldnt have been doing that.\"However, I think the two things are distinctly dferent, I declared what I do, I am not hiding anything.\"In relation to speaking in favour of the planning application in March, Mr Clarke said: \"They have said I was called as an MLA,I was ever called as an MLA I am sure I would have corrected that. If you listen to the recording [ of the council meeting] I think you will find I was called as Trevor Clarke and not an MLA. That is my understanding.\"I am not making any denial. I am involved in Versatile and doing planning applications but that is distinctly dferent from what I do as an MLA.\"Mr Clarke said thatan inidual comes to him with a planning query for him to handle from start to finish that this was \"distinctly dferent\" from going to an MLA in their role to support you.\"On the night of a council meeting, it shouldnt matteryou are a member of the public an MLA, a QC or anything , itshould be based on the planning case that has been put, regardless of who puts the case,\" he said.\"I think is were it is dferent. I would go regularly and support constituents as an MLA and I then I go in a commercial capacity where Versatile is involved in the case. I think we have only been once where we have spoken in a case for Versatile ,others have either been decided by delegated authority by the planners or they have been refused.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup mla says rathfriland water tower flags very tastefully done","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It paid more than £.m between April and June this year alone.The Northern Trust was closely followed by the Southern Trust which paid more than £m between   and June this year.The Belfast Trust shelled out almost £m to SNG over the same period, while the Western Trust paid almost £m between   and June this year.The South Eastern Trust had the smallest bill — standing at just under £m for agency nurses from SNG between   and June this year.The figures have come to light just weeks after it emerged that one in six people in Northern Ireland is waiting longer than one year for a first outpatient appointment.Staff shortages and budget cuts are largely to blame for Northern Ireland’s spiralling waiting list shame.At the same time, the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland is campaigning for better pay and conditions for its members in Northern Ireland as an increasing number of nurses are leaving the profession due to burn-out.There are currently around , vacant registered nursing posts in the health service, and a similar level in nursing homes, meaning health bosses are being forced to turn to agencies to keep services running.Paula Bradshaw, the Alliance Party’s health spokeswoman, said: “I have been working closely with the RCN over recent months in lobbying the Department of Health to address the sustainability of the nursing workforce and the high levels of pressure and responsibility placed upon them. data-dfpadtargetingThe Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw“Therefore, it is understandable why many qualied nurses opt to work for nursing agencies or, increasingly, work in a full-time job for a health trust, plus register with a nursing agency for bank shts, to supplement their income.“There are a number of issues that need to be addressed — firstly, this immediate one of installing a legislative framework in Northern Ireland that ensures that agencies operate within a controlled environment.“Secondly, we need to stabilise the nursing workforce here by ensuring that their pay and conditions are comparable to agency staff, so that vacancies become less frequent due to stress and unsafe working practices.”RCNdirector Pat Cullen said: “The RCN has continuously highlighted how excessive expenditure on agency nurses is a symptom of the nurse staffing crisis here in Northern Ireland. Addressing this issue is a major priority for our safe and effective care campaign.”The SNG declined to comment. A spokesman from the Department of Health said no cap exists in Northern Ireland to restrict the amount of money medical staffing agencies can charge the health service.When he announced his plans to introduce a cap on agency charges in October , Mr Hunt said: “For too long staffing agencies have been able to rip off the NHS by charging extortionate hourly rates which cost billions of pounds a year and undermine staff working hard to deliver high-quality care.“The tough new controls on spending that we’re putting in place will help the NHS improve continuity of care for patients and invest in the frontline, while putting an end to the days of unscrupulous companies charging up to £, a sht for a doctor.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Punters zip-lined over kayakers and SUPers on the lake. Whoops spilled from the Wild Water Rapids. Activities booked ranged from Bollywood dancing to indoor bowling.Lodges smelled new.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"picture special royal welsh show powys county times camera club stars","story":"A magnicent beast at the Royal RWelsh Show from Mick Pleszkan.\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsFrom the equine classes at the Royal Welsh Showby Mick Pleszkan\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsAgony of choice...

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One was in relation to a report of a loud bang in the Tullygally Road area of Craigavon. About  minutes later there was another report from a Belfast-based newspaper that they had received a report that a device had been fired at a police patrol but it missed its target. We responded and discovered a suspicious object at a bus shelter close to Aldervale flats.“We put up cordons, which caused a bit of disruption to local residents, on the advice of Army Technical Officers. They advised us that the flats had to be evacuated.Device was found close to a bus shelter in the Tullygally area of Craigavon“There were a number of people who were reluctant to leave but we engaged with them and persuaded people to go to alternative accommodation. Quite a few had family members that they could go to in the area. Also the Parochial House was opened up and people were able to go there,” said Supt Middleton.“I want to stress my thanks to everyone who did engage with us and support us in very dficult circumstances and also for the very public outpouring of support we have had since then from both members of the community and elected representatives. It meant a lot to me at the time and to my officers.“Our colleagues in ATO made the device safe. It was a viable device. It was a dangerous device that had been left at the bus shelter. “It was a mortar-type device which had not been fired at a passing police patrol. We were able to clary that very quickly. It was attached to a concrete block and that concrete block had been manufactured - and within that concrete block was a device containing explosives. This was designed to kill.“Our working hypothesis and that of the investigations team was that the initial bang was to draw us into the area and then with the secondary device and anybody who would be handling the suspicious object - it was designed to kill.“We have already got feedback in relation to that. The ATO, when they made the device safe, they were able to report to me that it was viable and it was designed to kill.“We believe the device was an attempt by dissident republican terrorists to murder police officers. I condemn this strongly.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She said there have been no arrests as yet and the investigations is at an early stage.“No group has claimed responsibility and the investigation team have an open mind as to which grouping it might be.“My assessment is the threat that we are facing is coming from within local communities and I want to offer reassurances as well that this will not deter us in any shape or form.“As the local commander my responsibility is for making sure we deliver high quality and effective policing service. I can assure the local communities of this district, that is what our focus will be.“This won’t put us off and we will continue to build on the strong relationships that we already have in the local community.“This was a completely reckless attack. This was a busy residential area. This is a busy road and right beside a bus stop and a block of flats. When the ATO advised me that the flats needed to be evacuated that gives you some insight into the size and the damage that could have been caused.“I would like to appeal for information. This really saddens me what has happened on Friday night. We are no dferent from any other emergency service. We are just trying to provide a service to the local community and be there when the community need us most.“What I do know is the explosives need to have been sourced somewhere. The bomb had to be constructed. You will see from the photographs, this was a sophisticated construction. It wasn’t crude. It had to be transported. It had to be put in place where it would have maximum impact and then the people that did it had to leave the area.“My appeal is for anybody who, in the weeks and days leading up to Friday night, saw anything suspicious in terms of vehicles or people.“I can assure any of your readers that I am not interested in who they are. All I am interested in is what they know.“We have a report as well from a witness that saw a young male running away onto rough ground from the bus shelter area. That was about quarter to twelve on Friday night which would have been in and around the time that is relevant to us and went onto the black paths.“He is described as being ’” to ’”, slight to medium build and on that basis the witness felt they were young, in their late teens to early s, wearing a light grey or beige long sleeve hooded top with the hood up and face covered. We are particularly interested in speaking to that person.”When asked what direction the witness saw the male running, Superintendent Middleton said they did not know but it would be helpful to find out in which direction he ran.Askedshe was concerned about an escalation of dissident activity, she said: “Obviously it is of concern that we have had a viable bomb left in a public road in Craigavon which I believe was intended for my officers. So that is of concern to me and that is increasing activity, obvious increasing activity. But the reality is the threat to serving officers in Northern Ireland is severe and has been for the last ten years, and certainly within this area, I have seen a consistent threat rather than anything that would have happened in peaks and troughs. We are aware of it. It is something that is a priority to the PSNI - is the threat of violent extremism and therefore it is something we take into account and consideration in our policing response.”When askedthis would mean even more caution in a police emergency response, she said: “No I don’t think so. This is what we are used to unfortunately. It is very sad that I have to say that but it is what our policing environment looks like here in Northern Ireland.“I think, even in terms of our response on Saturday morning in the early hours, it shows how alive we are to the possibilities with such devices. While it saddens me, it doesn’t surprise me.”try catch  TrendingPSNI probe after man dies suddenlyMumrsquos heartbreak after dog dies following lake swimScott Brown to be laid to restSafety concerns at state of land amid lsquoblame gamersquo over ownershipArrest after pound, of suspected heroin found in Co Armagh*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.
