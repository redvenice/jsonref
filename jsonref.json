Everyone was in shock. Then red hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra,\u0027 she said. \u0027The cloud got bigger, white and grey.

The local barman, speaking in Italian, told them: \u0027Get out of here - but be calm\u0027.The trio, on a week-long holiday to Sicily, ran back to their hotel in the mountainous area - and feared rockfall from subsequent tremors as they manoeuvred around a cliff face.Alana, of Bethnal Green, London, said they had planned to go on a tour of Stromboli today (Thurs) but thankfully postponed it. She fears people touring the volcano may have been killed.Alana said: \u0027We were on the beach sunbathing on an air mattresses having alcohol spritz.\u0027Then we heard a really loud boom as though thunder and lightning had struck right next to us and saw people running along the beach.\u0027You can see Stromboli from the bay and there was a big mushroom cloud erupting - it looked like a nuke.\u0027A barman ran down and was speaking Italian to us.\u0027We thought he was saying \u0027Be calm it\u0027s OK\u0027 but actually he was saying \u0027Get out of her - but be calm\u0027.\u0027Staff were collecting our beach chairs and instead of putting them in the usual spot they were grabbing them and throwing them to one side before running away.\u0027We realised it was a big deal when the locals started to freak out and were running for their lives. There were 20 other people on the beach.\u0027Alana, originally from Melbourne, Australia, also described the terror of running back to their hotel, fearing further tremors could cause rockfall.She added: \u0027We thought \u0027We will be OK when we get back to our hotel\u0027.\u0027But we are in a mountainous area so running back we were concerned about potential tremors which could cause rocks to fall.\u0027We are worried that people may have died because there are tours which go around Stromboli - we were planning on going on it today but decided to do it tomorrow.\u0027We were also told people were boats out of the port because they feared a tidal wave could form which would destroy them - there are expensive super yachts in the area.\u0027Alana, due to marry in August 2020, says the trio are heading back to the UK on Friday.

Von der Leyen, now 60, is proud of her roots of her wealthy cotton merchant ancestors in BremenHowever, none of this seems to have harmed the progress of a woman born into the ‘EU aristocracy’. The daughter of Ernst Albrecht, one of the original Eurocrats when the European Economic Community was formed in 1957, she was brought up in Brussels where she attended the famous European School.It was an upbringing, rubbing shoulders with the middle-class children of other well-to-do Eurocrats, which led to her becoming a fervent enthusiast for European integration.In 2011, von der Leyen called for a ‘United States of Europe’ — something which the ultra-federalist may well use her new role to bring to fruition.She is, of course, fiercely anti-Brexit, describing events since the referendum as a ‘burst bubble of hollow promises... inflated by populists’ and last year saying that Brexit is a ‘loss for everyone’.Von der Leyen, now 60, is proud of her roots of her wealthy cotton merchant ancestors in Bremen, while her husband of 33 years, Heiko von der Leyen, a medical professor and CEO of a medical engineering firm, is a descendant of an even posher family of silk-weavers.When Von der Leyen came to study at the London School of Economics in 1978, her family wealth was feared to put her at the risk of kidnap by the Red Army Faction — a German far-left terrorist group. She studied economics under the pseudonym ‘Rose Ladson’. Later, she switched to medicine, was awarded a doctorate in 1990, and practised as a gynaecologist — giving birth to seven children herself between 1987-1999. The family are Lutheran Evangelical Christians.Her academic career, however, threatened to unwind in 2016 when she was accused of plagiarism in her doctoral thesis. After an investigation, Hanover Medical School decided that Von der Leyen was guilty only of a mistake, not intentional copying.Just before Christmas in 2016, in the very room in the Palais de Justice in Paris where Marie- Antoinette was sentenced to be guillotined, Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, was found guilty of ‘negligence with public money’ over a multi-million Euro payout to a business tycoon.Yet, unlike the French queen, Lagarde escaped with barely a slap on the wrist. The court waived a one-year prison sentence and a 15,000 euro fine, on the grounds of her ‘international reputation’ which, cynics might observe, is a rather rum approach to justice.Lagarde was finance minister in Nicolas Sarkozy’s government in 2007 when she approved a 404million euro payout (£363m) of taxpayers’ money to a controversial French businessman and friend of Sarkozy, Bernard Tapie.It was a long-running case that revolved around the sale by Tapie of his majority share in sportswear company Adidas to a bank, Credit Lyonnais, part owned by the state.         Lagarde is famously outspoken on Brexit — claiming she can’t see ‘any positive side to it’When the bank sold the shares at a higher price, Tapie accused it of defrauding him and the payment was in effect compensation awarded by a private arbitration panel.Lagarde was convicted for failing to contest the panel’s ruling when there were solid grounds for doing so. She insisted that she had only ever done her duty and may have been misled by civil servants.The verdict on the high profile case did nothing to dent Lagarde’s career. Within 24 hours, the IMF — Sarkozy had lobbied hard for her to get the job in 2011 — in Washington DC gave her their full backing.And so she has continued on her trail-blazing way ever since — to her likely new appointment as President of the European Central Bank.With her penchant for Chanel suits and Hermes scarves, Lagarde is known as the ‘rock star of finance’. But unusually for the putative head of a central bank she has no banking experience.She herself has acknowledged her limitations in the field, saying in 2012: ‘I’ve studied a bit of economics, but I’m not a super-duper economist.’Lagarde is famously outspoken on Brexit — claiming she can’t see ‘any positive side to it’ — and an ally of former Chancellor George Osborne and the Project Fear cadre. At a press conference in 2016 with Osborne, she warned Brexit would be ‘pretty bad, to very, very bad’.Lagarde also chooses to ignore that the IMF’s predictions for the UK have been consistently wrong.At 63, she exerts discipline over every aspect of her life — a teetotal vegetarian who works out every day, swims, and cycles up to 20 miles a week.She has enjoyed an intriguing love life, married and orced twice, with two sons in their 30s with her first husband. Her current partner is old love, Xavier Giocanti, a Corsican businessman she met at law school.   STEPHEN GLOVER: With grubby backdoor stitch-ups like this, thank God we\u0027re going! The process of extricating ourselves from the EU has turned out to be so prolonged and painful that it’s sometimes easy to forget our original reasons for wanting to leave.I can’t be the only person who, having voted for Brexit, occasionally asks himself if it’s worth all the bitterness and ision: the name-calling, ruined dinner parties and former friends scuttling by on the other side of the street.It’s remarkable how the arguments about sovereignty and controlling our own borders and the undesirability of a European superstate have virtually disappeared amid squabbles over No Deal and a second referendum.              European leaders have been selecting the successors of Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and Donald Tusk, (right) who have loomed so large in our livesSo I have given thanks to the EU over recent days as European leaders have spent hours horse-trading behind closed doors. They have been selecting the successors of Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, who have loomed so large in our lives.We have been reminded how fundamentally undemocratic and secretive the organisation is. People who will wield enormous power have been chosen without the voters of Europe getting a look-in.Thank God we’re leaving! Thank God (unless intransigent Remainers finagle another referendum) we will soon no longer be part of a body that furtively picks our future rulers — for these people are far more than functionaries — without consulting the people.This club is not for me. Nor do I believe that many Remainers watched the wrangling with any sense of pride. In a democratic age, it’s impossible to defend such practices. Let’s get out while we can, without ill will or venom.Which is why the boorish behaviour of the 29 Brexit Party MEPs at the opening ceremony of the European Parliament in Strasbourg was so appalling. They turned their backs as the EU anthem, Beethoven’s Ode To Joy, was performed.How rude and petty and spiteful they were. How shaming to this nation. They have been elected to the European Parliament and are cheerfully drawing salaries and expenses. Yet they behaved like uncouth members of a student debating society.What must cultivated Europeans (and there are some in the European Parliament) think of the British political class, which used to have a reputation on the continent of being polite, well-mannered and tolerant?The smaller Liberal Democrat contingent didn’t behave much better, sporting, on yellow T-shirts, the undemocratic slogan ‘B******s to Brexit’. This was a coarse and puerile gesture — and a little threatening.Do MEPs of both parties speak for modern Britain? If so, the EU will be relieved to be rid of us. I feel ashamed, as I did when British football hooligans went on the rampage abroad. These oafs in Strasbourg are supposed to be our representatives.My question to the Brexit Party, whose loutish behaviour was particularly mortifying, is this: why don’t you draw attention to the autocratic nature of the EU by employing reasoned argument, rather than cheap and demeaning tricks?For the evidence is there, writ large. Cutting grubby deals in private, as European leaders have been doing, is not merely undemocratic. It leads to outcomes that are likely to be injurious to the citizens of the EU.The whole process is a Franco-German stitch-up. Neither country necessarily gets the person it wants in every post, but each has to be happy with the final compromise. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, originally pushed the centre-Right German politician Manfred Weber for the crucial role of President of the European Commission in succession to Mr Juncker.But President Emmanuel Macron of France didn’t like the look of Weber because of his political background. He preferred centre-Left Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister.         The boorish behaviour of the 29 Brexit Party MEPs at the opening ceremony of the European Parliament in Strasbourg was appalling, writes Stephen Glover However, various Right-wing governments, such as those in Poland, Hungary and Italy rejected Timmermans, whereupon Macron championed Ursula von der Leyen, a member of Mrs Merkel’s centre-Right party and Germany’s defence minister.After much haggling, she was chosen, despite having been embroiled in a controversy over the awarding of contracts (she was eventually exonerated). From November 1, she will occupy the most important position in the EU.Is she the best person for the job? No one can say — though she wasn’t the favourite to follow Mrs Merkel when the Chancellor stands down in 2021. Not fit to lead Germany, apparently, but suitable to lead the EU.What is clear is that no single European voter had a direct say in choosing Ms von der Leyen, though it is true the European Parliament will have to endorse her and some on the Left may vote against.Oh, I should have said: Ms von der Leyen, like Jean-Claude Juncker, is a passionate advocate of a United States of Europe and a European army. Like her predecessor, she hates the idea of Brexit. Yesterday, she told a private audience EU negotiators had done a ‘noble job’.What would have happened if Britain wasn’t leaving the EU? She would still become President of the Commission because she is the incarnation of the EU’s values — just like Juncker, whose coronation David Cameron humiliatingly opposed in vain in 2014.Ursula von der Leyen is more of the same: an unelected (at least in Brussels) member of a European political elite that wants to extend the powers of the EU in relation to inidual countries. That’s why I’m glad we’re leaving.By the way, I don’t draw much comfort from the news that senior Eurocrat Martin Selmayr, who appears to dislike Britain, faces the axe later this year under a reshuffle. There are plenty more where he came from.A second president was also chosen by EU leaders. Charles Michel will give up the job of Belgium’s interim Prime Minister to fill the shoes of Donald Tusk as President of the European Council, a role co-ordinating member states.Michel is a close friend of Macron, which is cosy. He’s another arch-euro federalist who wants ‘ever closer union’, and will be no friend to Britain as it leaves his precious EU.A third president was also crowned by European leaders: Christine Lagarde, who has run the International Monetary Fund since 2011, pocketing more than £3.6 million tax-free in the process, will become President of the European Central Bank.This is a bizarre appointment. For one thing, she has been convicted of criminal negligence over a French corruption scandal, though I doubt this was of much concern to the panjandrums who selected her.For another, she is a politician, rather than an economist, and not obviously suited to the role of central banker. She was a lynchpin in Project Fear before the June 2016 referendum and prophesied a hitherto-unrealised economic catastrophe for the UK.As Britain has not adopted the euro, maybe Ms Lagarde’s future role is not our business. On the other hand, it isn’t in anybody’s interests for the eurozone to flounder.These three freshly minted presidents will wield enormous sway over the peoples of Europe. They will try to strengthen the powers of Brussels, though they are certain to be resisted by populist governments in Hungary, Italy and Poland.No one can say how the experiment of further European integration will end. Looking at its latest manifestation, I can only say that I am more glad than ever that Britain will not be part of it. "},{"url":null,"title":"Truck rolls Rocky Mountain National Park Colorado road driver forgot use parking brake","story":"Share this article As other motorists cruise down the winding road oblivious to what occurred, some witnesses pull over to help while other continue with their journey.When the shocked onlookers consider helping the driver who lost his white truck, they conscious not to have the same thing happen to them.One weary passenger warns: \u0027Put your parking brake on.\u0027Photographs show how the drop for the truck wasn\u0027t too steep it got caught in between trees which held it in place.

If confirmed as Mario Draghi’s replacement, the head of the International Monetary Fund would be the first ECB president without any direct experience of setting central bank policy. Although a lawyer by professional background, Lagarde could be helped by the political experience she has gained through stints at the IMF and as France’s finance minister. Presiding over the ECB, whose responsibilities include setting the eurozone interest rate and ensuring the stability of the banking system, is viewed as a tough task given the requirement to oversee 19 eurozone economies.Lagarde arrives with several challenges facing the ECB. Here are the key issues she must address:Financial markets across Europe have rallied on the news of her nomination, with investors viewing her as a continuity candidate who is not likely to ditch Draghi’s policies supporting economic growth.While Lagarde has no central bank experience for investors to pore over for clues on her monetary policy stance, her speeches at the IMF have typically favoured dovish policies, meaning an inclination to keep interest rates low. Hawks, in contrast, favour higher borrowing costs to combat inflationary pressures.The eurozone remains an unfinished monetary and political union, suffering from deep isions between member states over the appropriate level of centralisation.Her political connections could help prod EU governments towards using more tax and spending measures to stimulate the eurozone economy, which the central bank has been arguing for without much success.Lagarde will need to keep an eye on Italy, where economic growth is weak and government debt high. Rome has had repeated rows with Brussels over its budget. The prospect of eurosceptic movements pushing to leave the single currency could send markets into a tailspin, requiring swift reaction from the central bank.She has comprehensive experience of the eurozone debt crisis from her time at the IMF, overseeing the bailouts of Greece and other nations struggling at the time. She also backed Draghi after he pledged to do “whatever it takes” to keep the euro from breaking apart in 2012.The ECB’s political independence is enshrined in an EU treaty. However, Lagarde’s previous role in French politics brings this sharply into question and also comes as the principle of central bank independence is challenged elsewhere around the world.With Spain’s former finance minister Luis de Guindos as vice-president of the ECB, two former politicians will hold the top jobs, an institution more traditionally dominated by technocrats.Financial markets could be rattled if investors believe nation states could apply pressure over monetary policy decisions, similar to the concerns over Donald Trump applying pressure at the US Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell, who leads the American central bank, has had to reassure markets of his independence.That Lagarde is not a trained economist means she may need to rely more on ECB staff and technical members of its governing council. The appointment of Philip Lane, the former Irish central bank governor, as chief economist will help her in this regard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c85f5b7bdb524a150745282fc746154ef9942de/0_280_2741_1644/master/2741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0e97088f74d1e72640a3f1f318c52ed","title":"share prices rally at lagardes nomination as ecb president","story":"Move reinforces expectations of fresh stimulus package for ailing eurozone economyThe prospect of a fresh stimulus package to support the ailing eurozone economy when Christine Lagarde takes up the reins as boss of the currency bloc’s central bank sent shares higher across Europe and the US on Wednesday.European Union leaders’ nomination of Lagarde, currently the head of the International Monetary Fund, to replace Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank (ECB) widely reinforced expectations of more monetary policy easing this year.With a slowdown in growth taking hold in most developed economies, especially across the manufacturing sector, markets have expected central banks to respond by cutting borrowing costs for businesses and households.Draghi has already signalled that falling inflation in the eurozone will demand a response from the central bank, probably in the form of further quantitative easing. Lagarde is expected to support this policy, despite likely objections from German policymakers keen to boost interest rates back to levels seen before the financial crisis.Bond markets were also dominated by the likelihood of cheaper borrowing courtesy of Lagarde at the helm of the ECB, with borrowing rates across the 19-member eurozone dipping lower.“We have already seen some weak data in recent weeks, so that is the backdrop,” said Elwin de Groot, the head of macro strategy at Rabobank. “And now we have Christine Lagarde as the likely successor of Mr Draghi at the ECB, which for the market says that the dovish policies will continue.”Donald Trump, who has argued that the US Federal Reserve boss, Jerome Powell, should provide a monetary stimulus to boost US growth, welcomed the latest increase in stock market values.The Fed has signalled that it is prepared to cut rates this year, possibly as early as this month boosting US stock markets that had flagged earlier in the year when Powell appeared to rule out reversing three years of increasing borrowing costs.He said exuberant markets, hopeful “that the appointment of Christine Lagarde to the ECB will herald a more activist approach from the central bank”, could soon deflate unless central banks moved quickly.Beauchamp added that the failure of oil prices to rise strongly indicated that commodity traders believed global tensions arising from Trump’s trade tariff war with China would continue to dominate sentiment and hit global growth.Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “The latest downturn has followed a gradual deterioration in demand over the past year as Brexit-related uncertainty has increasingly exacerbated the impact of a broader global economic slowdown.” Figures showed the UK’s economy stalled last month.The pound flirted with two-week lows and stood at $1.2568, on course for its fifth drop in the past six trading sessions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb6042e46563549f9d503bce7a74ebc2be9008cf/0_135_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b766b09d6b7a8a4c3f3abd849faf61","title":"george osborne aiming for new role as head of imf","story":"Former chancellor and current Standard editor seeking to be first Briton in post, reports suggestGeorge Osborne is considering putting his name forward to replace Christine Lagarde as the head of the International Monetary Fund, according to reports, a move that would see him become the first Briton to lead the Washington-based body.The former chancellor – and current Evening Standard editor –\u0026nbsphas told allies he would be well suited to succeed Lagarde, the Financial Times reported, after she was picked to lead the European Central Bank this week.Such a development would mark a dramatic return to a major public role for Osborne three years after he was unceremoniously sacked as chancellor in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, facing a barrage of criticism over a botched campaign to have the UK remain in the EU.It would also mark the first time in the 75-year history of the IMF that a Briton has led the global body, which acts as the lender of last resort to nations in financial distress.In the unwritten rules surrounding the formation of the Bretton Woods institution, a European has always held the top job, while an American has led the World Bank – its twin institution, which aims to encourage financial stability, international trade and sustainable economic growth.Osborne could face stiff competition from other highly qualified candidates at a time when Britain’s place in the world has been coloured by internal disputes over leaving the EU, clouding the UK’s international reputation.Other contenders may include Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, who was installed by Osborne. Although Canadian by birth, he holds Irish and UK citizenship. Carney is due to leave Threadneedle Street early next year.While Osborne’s bid may be harmed by Brexit and by a reputation for unhelpfulness during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, he reportedly told friends that his connections with the US and China, the two biggest world economies, may work in his favour.He may also hope for support from Boris Johnson, after throwing the weight of the Standard behind the former foreign secretary’s campaign for prime minister.Osborne was criticised for doom-laden warnings over the economy made before the EU referendum, as well as for the imposition of a long period of austerity on Britain, which is viewed as being one of the key reasons that fuelled the Brexit vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6dc585afbbdf160383709b5f72f082f41a60ef/0_214_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28313a6336245c51e7cef349dbad63cf","title":"brexit party meps uk brexiteers opening european parliament","story":"On Tuesday, Brexit party MEPs decided to take a stand against the undemocratic EU they’d been elected to democratically. Rather than do something frivolous such as returning their wages, they decided to turn their backs at the playing of the European anthem during the parliament’s opening ceremony, a move only slightly classier than mooning.When the 29 Brexiteers were elected to the European parliament, many were concerned that they wouldn’t represent the UK properly. And yet here they were on day one already crapping themselves for attention – and as such were representing the UK better than we possibly could have imagined. Shortly afterwards, Nigel Farage tweeted proudly “The Brexit party has already made its presence felt”, and he’s right, in the same way that a toddler smearing spaghetti on the walls of a fancy restaurant while repeating every swearword they know will grab the attention of their parents. Who knows what the party has in store next, but we should probably set our faces to apologetic cringe mode just in case. From the get-go the new MEPs have been looking for aspects of the EU “gravy train” to get outraged by while chugging down the gravy. Annunziata Rees-Mogg got the ball rolling a few weeks ago by tweeting disbelief that she had been given an iPad to do work on. A real “woman gets given work device to work on by work” shocker.What must the EU think of us at this point, based on the crop of clueless idiots we’ve sent to represent us? A woman so posh the first of her three names is Annunziata accepting paycheques but getting all hoity-toity whenever she is offered a pen, and a former lads’ mag supremo thinking the height of extravagance is having a parliament building at all, ganging up with 27 other absolute Widdecombes to remind everyone of Nazis in the Reichstag.Even the Lib Dems – who were meant to be our grownups – decided to arrive wearing “Bollocks to Brexit” tops, which, even if you agree with the sentiment, isn’t an obvious choice of clothing for your first day on a job. Maybe next time, instead of a profanity T-shirt, try wearing a nicely ironed tie?The shenanigans at the European parliament might not be the worst of it. When EU leaders look at the UK – a nation they told not to waste the extra time it has been given to sort this mess out – they see a leadership contest unfolding between one terrible foreign secretary who compared the EU to a Soviet prison and a slightly worse foreign secretary who compared the EU to Hitler. Both of whom are insisting that they’re so good at diplomacy that a new deal with the EU is all but guaranteed. From the inside, the contest feels a bit like watching drugged-up, half-crazed monkeys fighting for control of a clown car you’re in the back of. It must be even weirder watching that clown car from the outside as it heads right at you at full speed, its drivers screaming (in monkey) “LET’S GIVE TALKS ANOTHER TRY”.With not much time left to escape no deal (again, again) we’re relying on the EU not being sick enough of us by 31 October to grant us another extension when we inevitably beg for one. Based on the candidates for prime minister at home and our MEPs in Strasbourg cooking up new ways to be self-shaming jerks (all at the expense of the European taxpayers), you might want to start stockpiling Halloween-themed tinned goods before the mid-October rush.• James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c387c2e0f050c0dcc60b10da8a87136678df6f4/0_77_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf8e9001c482c3f11a9b81741cdcb90","title":"jeremy corbyn health the times civil service leak","story":"A firebrand leftwing Labour leader whose radical political prospectus terrifies the establishment a smear campaign alleging ill health fostered by unaccountable figures seeking to oust him from power. This is the plot of A Very British Coup, a 1982 work of fiction by former Labour minister Chris Mullin that centres on the rise to power of plain-speaking Harry Perkins. Election euphoria has given way to turmoil and crisis. With Perkins deemed irretrievably unpopular, the media demands he stands aside for a more “moderate” colleague. At this moment, agents of the British state – supposedly impartial servants of the elected government – take the opportunity to strike.Now, there is not a single person in Corbyn’s circle who fears for his health he has a more vigorous fitness regime than most 20-year-olds. If Corbyn was “frail”, as briefed, his performance in the bearpit of prime minister’s questions would reveal it. Strikingly, the concerns about Corbyn’s health seem to merge with political objections to his agenda. “He needs to have a grasp of the domestic agenda in the 21st century, rather than living in the past,” one civil servant is quoted as saying.Park what you think about Corbyn for a moment. Britain is supposed to be a democracy. In a democracy, the civil service has to be studiously neutral. In the code they are supposed to follow, officials are told: “Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media”, and “act in a way which deserves and retains the confidence of ministers, while at the same time ensuring that you will be able to establish the same relationship with those whom you may be required to serve in some future government”. Briefing a newspaper about the unsuitability of the leader of the opposition is a flagrant violation of this code.Corbyn has written to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to ask for an independent investigation. Some commentators have asked why Labour is helping to keep a news story centring on Corbyn’s ill health running. But again: park your political sympathies. This threat must not be met with silence.Some critics of the contemporary left believe that it is conspiratorial. It is certainly true that there exists within it a strand of what could be called “conspiracism”, which holds that power is wielded by shadowy iniduals, rather than understanding capitalism as a system of competing power relations. This conspiracism is usually misplaced, and has its roots in the fact that socialism disappeared for a generation, re-emerging suddenly, without deep-rooted ideological or institutional underpinnings. It’s certainly not the case that establishment manoeuvrings are Labour’s sole block on power: for example, the party’s failure to clarify its Brexit stance risks severe self-harm.Yet sometimes conspiracies do exist, driven by self-preservation on the part of the powerful. Who would deny the Hillsborough cover-up was a conspiracy? What of collusion between the police, security services and loyalists in the murder of Catholics in Northern Ireland? Senior civil servants, clearly hostile to the left, breaking the civil service code to brief the Murdoch press ahead of a possible election is just as surely a conspiracy.There are two further reasons for the hostility towards Corbynism. The first is that the Labour leadership has an extra-parliamentary theory of change: it believes winning an election is insufficient, that mobilising people – through protests, direct action, strikes – plays an important role, too. The second is what can be described as the “anti-imperialist” tradition of key Labour figures, who believe western foreign policy is frequently dictated by economic self-interest. Both of these positions scare very powerful people. But again, perhaps you object to them, too perhaps you object to hiking taxes on the rich, or increased public investment, or the expansion of public ownership. It is irrelevant. The civil service is there to execute the policies of the elected government. If it reveals itself to be politically motivated, then this critical pillar of democracy must be questioned by us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d381701b90ad4046f7d5d0cd9bc911ed644e548/0_136_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3827a0fc7e91d63845c16ac591fef320","title":"kimono western culture kim kardashian west","story":"It’s no surprise that Kim Kardashian West appropriated kimono to give sex appeal to her shapewear line, writes Akemi JohnsonThe two Asian women painted on the facade of the Irish pub outside the US military base in Okinawa, Japan, wore kimono. They lounged on a white-sand beach. Their black hair was coiled atop their heads, and their garments were falling open to reveal bare legs and cleavage.Never mind that the real women in that area didn’t dress like that. Instead of kimono and up-dos they sported colored contacts, blonde hair extensions, fake tans and jeans. Never mind that kimono are ankle-length and high-necked, covered-up. To the artist or bar owner, the picture that would draw men inside, the epitome of desire, was the woman in the kimono – and an erotic style of kimono that doesn’t exist.It’s no surprise that Kim Kardashian West appropriated kimono to sell underwear. In the western imagination, Asian women have long been sexualized, and an emblem of the Asian woman is the iconic Japanese gown.When American troops invaded Okinawa in April 1945, the specter of the sexualized Asian woman already existed. “The pigs and chickens are okay,” one marine told a Chicago Daily Tribune reporter, shortly after the American landing, “but I’m disappointed in the girls. They’re not what they told me.” Implying a surprised disgust, the reporter goes on to describe local women bathing and washing their clothes in a roadside trough.These were women caught between opposing forces on a battlefield, tasked with fighting for their lives amid a “typhoon of steel”. And yet these American invaders saw them only in sexual terms, evaluated alongside livestock.This viewpoint continued in the aftermath of the battle, when Okinawan survivors were traumatized and destitute. “Hubba! Hubba!” reads a caption in a US military souvenir booklet produced just after the war. The photo is of an Okinawan woman dressed in worn clothes and sandals, her baby strapped to her back.Maybe Kardashian West’s attempt to name her shapewear line Kimono was a marketing stunt – with the backlash, how many of us have now seen her nude bodysuits – or maybe the word seemed to offer up the exoticism, the sex appeal, she was looking for.In Japan, the kimono means something very different than in the west. In the country today, kimono are formal wear. Often made of silk and costing upwards of a thousand dollars, a kimono is attire for a wedding, a graduation or other special occasion. It connotes not sex, but tradition and elegance.Japanese Americans also joined the #KimOhNo outcry, but for those of us of Japanese heritage in the States, the kimono can have a more complicated symbolism. My own relationship to the style of clothing began as a toddler, when my mother first dressed me up in a mini kimono-like garment. When I was in third grade, my great-grandmother, who had immigrated to the United States from Hiroshima, visited my school to demonstrate the tricky process of putting a kimono on.Years later, studying abroad in Kyoto in college, my first time to Japan, I tried on an authentic kimono myself, when my classmates and I rented them for a day. “It looks better if your geta are too small,” the Japanese woman dressing me said. Wearing too-small shoes was just one way the kimono-wearing experience was physically restrictive. In the tight column of fabric, I tottered around the city’s historic streets.To the tourists who snapped photos of me that day, I may have looked like a traditional Japanese woman, a titillating figure straight from the pages of Memoirs of a Geisha. But I knew to the natives of the city even the classic Japanese gown wouldn’t cause them to see past my mixed-race face and American ways. Even wearing a kimono, I wasn’t truly Japanese.The Japanese American artist Judy Shintani has a series called Deconstructed Kimonos. Shintani transforms kimono by cutting away patterns in the fabric, reducing them to shreds.“My alterations reflect the loosening connection to my ancestry and culture,” she writes, and she evokes the intense pressure Japanese Americans felt to assimilate during the second world war. After Pearl Harbor, her family and many others, including mine, made bonfires out of anything deemed Japanese. Into the flames went Japanese scrolls, books and kimono.As a symbol of Japanese American culture, Shintani’s shredded kimono feels fitting. Ravaged by a life in America, it, as Shintani writes, “is reduced to a skeleton, a web” – yet still retains the outlines of its original form.This is what America has done to the kimono. Kardashian West may have announced her intention to rename her brand, but the story of the kimono here has already been rewritten.Still, just the other day, a Japanese American friend gifted me a bright pink, tiny jinbei for my infant daughter. A mixed-race, fifth-generation Japanese American, my daughter will wear the cotton, kimono-like onesie to a summer obon festival. I imagine that, years from now, she can look back at a photo of herself in it and decide what the garment means to her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6db05025678b7439daa8a22f9bb6abe5e4a25cb/0_128_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2952b477ccb3633ad7d123858ec0fab","title":"soho unhealthiest place in britain other pleasures","story":"Soho has been ranked as the unhealthiest place to live in Britain – shock news that sends bears hurtling into the woods and the pope saying his rosary: in other words, no shit, Sherlock. Too many opportunities to get boozed up and fill your belly with calorific takeaways, and very few parks and green spaces in which to counter the excess and choking pollution, do not a Swiss sanatorium make.Nobody goes to Soho to get healthy, despite the recent arrival of the odd green-juice bar. They go to live the life of the flâneur, to soak up the psychic energy that generations of incomers – from 17th-century French Huguenots to the proprietors and staff of numerous Italian and Chinese restaurants, from music-hall artistes to struggling writers and artists – have imprinted into this tiny network of streets and alleys.But the milieu that causes dysfunction also provides its cure, as Thomas de Quincey discovered some 200 years ago. In Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, the writer recalls having a funny turn and being ministered to by Ann, a sex worker of his acquaintance: “One night, when we were pacing slowly along Oxford Street, and after a day when I had felt more than usually ill and faint, I requested her to turn off with me into Soho Square. Thither we went, and we sat down on the steps of a house, which to this hour I never pass without a pang of grief and an inner act of homage to the spirit of that unhappy girl, in memory of the noble action which she there performed.”The “noble action” was to fetch him a glass of port wine and spices from one of the area’s many hostelries, which revivifying draught enabled him to continue his vital researches into the transformative powers of laudanum and to bring us one of the earliest and most astute examples of addiction literature.For those of a certain cast of mind, to walk around Soho now is to walk among ghosts. At one end, just down from Liberty’s department store and the garish delights of Carnaby Street, stands the water pump that John Snow isolated as the cause of an outbreak of cholera in 1854, transforming our understanding of the spread of disease and the public health procedures that could mitigate it at the other, now defunct establishments such as the Hungarian restaurant The Gay Hussar, the Coach and Horses pub – gone only in the past fortnight – and the Colony Room Club, where foul-mouthed hostess Muriel Belcher served endless drinks to the likes of Francis Bacon and George Melly after the pubs had shut up shop for the afternoon.And yet we might balk at placing too great a premium on the “health” of an area, or at least put forward different ideas of what might constitute healthy. Soho would indeed score pretty low on the fresh-air index, but it would certainly go through the roof when it came to personal liberation for confirmation, ask any member of the gay community who found a safe haven on Old Compton Street during the more repressive 1970s and 80s. It’s why the Admiral Duncan pub, bombed by a neo-Nazi in 1999, refused to remove its pride flags when they were deemed to contravene planning regulations several years later.The threat, then, might not be the absence of bucolic pleasures – for those, you can jump on a train from nearby Charing Cross and be by the seaside in a couple of hours – but the homogeneity caused by sky-high business rates and the encroachment of chain restaurants and bars. A sanitised Soho – devoid of the roiling masses, the late-night dramas, the rubbish and detritus of near-24-hour city life – would be a poor thing indeed, however much it might send the area shooting up the clean-living ratings.And as much as the recent survey’s top-rated spot – Great Torrington in north Devon – undoubtedly boasts its own enchantments, the ability to drink a cappuccino from Bar Italia at 3am while watching a posse of drag queens make their way exhaustedly, but still fabulously, to the night bus sure ain’t one of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59db3337c95c5103a7510db1f650ba4adef2cc27/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f61464eb4b63c93d1f62d7d02625b6","title":"the guardian view on assisted dying the law is flawed","story":"MPs need to look again at legislation which currently allows no humane option for the families of a terminally ill patient“The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others,” wrote John Stuart Mill in his essay On Liberty, which has come to underpin liberal thought. The philosopher went on: “Over himself, over his own body and mind, the inidual is sovereign.” Though this standpoint is accepted in many parts of the law, in one crucial regard it is not: a terminally ill and suffering patient cannot be offered direct help in dying with dignity at a time or place of their choice. Those who break the law by assisting can face up to 14 years in prison.This threat hangs over the grieving families who travel from the UK to Switzerland for an assisted death: one each week. There are thought to be scores of cases in Britain where the terminally ill take their own lives in awful circumstances. The issue is one that brushes everyone we all have to experience the death of people about whom we care deeply. We all have to contemplate our own death.At present the director of public prosecutions, an inidual who holds office for a term of five years, effectively acts like a judge: deciding whether or not a person is guilty of hastening the death of terminally ill patients who wish to spare themselves and their loved ones from the final, crippling stages of degenerating health. It is the DPP who determines, via their own guidelines, whether or not a family member was motivated by compassion rather than pecuniary gain whether or not the assistance was minor whether or not they had reluctantly helped.This cannot be right. Courts need laws that draw the boundaries clearly between what is right and what is wrong. It cannot be up to the DPP to decide. In 2015 lawmakers rejected a private member’s bill which would have allowed “competent” adults with fewer than six months to live to seek professional help to kill themselves. Yet the issue has not gone away. Last November the supreme court dismissed an emergency application to hear a right-to-die case challenging the legal ban on assisted dying, but said that the matter was of “transcendent public importance”. On Thursday parliamentarians have a chance to restart that conversation with a Commons debate.Not only is public opinion moving ahead of the law in the UK, but parts of Europe and the United States have shown that it is possible to regulate rather than prohibit. A humane option in this regard is needed as the nation’s population of older adults is growing. There are important considerations about how, if the law was changed, vulnerable people could be insulated from insidious pressures and how trust in the medical profession could be maintained. Lawmakers are the right people to find the balance between personal autonomy and how paternalistic the state should be towards its citizens in this regard. A law that is near-impossible to implement, ethically and practically, ought to be looked at again by MPs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304d0e087810e4968a898f9c79605329523ba3ec/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b17e9b2da686bd7e072e51832f39ae","title":"ashes to ashes 20 how womens cricket developed to embrace new formats","story":"Ahead of this summer’s Women’s Ashes tour, Kalika Mehta takes a look back at the tournament’s history, from its unofficial beginning in the 1930sAlthough women’s competitive cricket dates back to the foundation of the Women’s Cricket Association (WCA) in 1926, it wasn’t until eight years later that an England team set sail for Australia for their first “unofficial” Ashes tour.With the hosts refusing to pay travel expenses, the team consisted of players who could afford the considerable £80 – nearly £5,000 in modern-day terms – charged by the WCA. If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

It comes with a £100,000 prize, the largest art award in Britain.Stephen Deuchar, the director of the Art Fund and the chair of judges, said the museum had been transformed by a redevelopment project that had involved the participation of hundreds of thousands of visitors and volunteers.“St Fagans lives, breathes and embodies the culture and identity of Wales,” he said. “This magical place was made by the people of Wales for people everywhere, and stands as one of the most welcoming and engaging museums anywhere in the UK.”One of the 2019 judges, Bridget McConnell, the chief executive of the charity Glasgow Life, praised the devolved Welsh government for being such an enthusiastic supporter of St Fagans.“Everyone I met and saw at St Fagans was in constant, lively conversation about their shared history, culture and lived experiences,” she said. “This is their place, and it is strongly felt on every visit.”St Fagans has more than 50 buildings that were moved to the site from locations around Wales allowing visitors to take a walk through Welsh history, from prehistoric times to the present day.It is the first Welsh winner of the museum of the year prize in its current form the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon won the Gulbenkian prize in 2005.St Fagans won from a shortlist that also included HMS Caroline in Belfast, the Nottingham Contemporary art gallery, the V\u0026ampA Dundee and the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which displays the university’s archaeological and anthropological collections.The museum, Wales’s most visited heritage attraction, has been welcoming visitors since 1948 when it opened as the Welsh Folk Museum. The completion of the six-year revamp last year was the organisation’s most ambitious project, creating new galleries, more learning spaces and a new building, Gweithdy – Welsh for “workshop” – which is intended as a national centre for creativity and craft skills.It joins previous winners, which range from the enormous – the British Museum (2011) and the V\u0026ampA (2016) – to the considerably smaller, such as the William Morris Gallery (2013)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb4c84e10525bb7a8edc5040f88f7c6cb040afa/0_7_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c69065a20512e025bffbd6afd12c783c","title":"ontario the year round holiday destination","story":"Hikers, bikers and wine aficionados will find something to love in Ontario. Here’s our guide to the best things to do in the region, season by seasonSpring is a good time to join a historic or culinary walking tour of Toronto or Ottawa, don’t forget to fuel up in one of the many good coffee shops. Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara’s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers.If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don’t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park.Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria’s birthday. It’s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians’ seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston.Don’t miss the waterways of Algonquin park – Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here. Like living life on two wheels? Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes.Summer is the peak season for festivals – starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let’s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others.As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario’s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights ride the Polar Bear Express  from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.In Ottawa, this is a good time to visit the National Gallery of Canada, the city’s premier art collection, or the fascinating Canadian Museum of History, the most visited museum in the country. Take a cycle tour to explore the capital’s many interesting neighbourhoods such as Byward Market and Centretown, indulge in a craft brewery tour or a food tour (or both!). Overindulgence in good food and drink peaks around Canada’s Thanksgiving in October. Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches.As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it’s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself. This is the time of year when the mist and spray off Niagara Falls freezes on the rocks, adding to the spectacle. For skiing, Blue Mountain is Ontario’s largest resort and great for beginners. Resorts in the Blue Mountain region or Muskoka, such as the luxurious JW Marriott Rosseau, Sherwood Inn, and Cedar Grove Lodge, or Deerhurst in Huntsville offer activities including cross-country skiing, skating, snow shoeing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, with a whole menu of spa treatments to ease any tired muscles.Ontario’s many spas include award-winning ones in Niagara and Prince Edward County, perfect for a break at any time of year but even cosier when the weather is chilly outside. At St Anne’s spa, 90 minutes from Toronto, you can even get wrapped in hot chocolate. For festive festivals, look out for Winterlude in Ottawa, with ice-carving, skating and curling the Icewine festival in Niagara Falls (which also celebrates its food), Winterlicious in Toronto (more seasonal culinary delights!), and Sault Sainte Marie’s Winter Carnival Bon Soo, complete with polar bear swims (where you swim like one, through an ice hole, rather than with one).Discover more of what Ontario has on offer all year round with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

Ari Aster is the film-maker who made his feature debut just last year with the chiller Hereditary, and now presents us with this fantastically sinister and self-aware Euro-bacchanal, clearly inspired by the 1973 classic The Wicker Man. And that is not the only riff. When Hereditary came out, I guessed (correctly, as it turned out) that the director was thinking about Bergman’s Cries and Whispers. I’m now going to bet 20p that before shooting Midsommar, Aster took another look at Tarkovsky’s The Sacrifice.Midsommar is an outrageous black-comic carnival of agony, starring charismatic Florence Pugh in a comely robe and floral headdress. It features funny-tasting pies and chorally assisted ritual sex, with pagan celebrants gazing into the middle distance and warbling as solemnly as the young dudes in the Coca-Cola TV ad about teaching the world to sing. It’s all set in an eerily beautiful sunlit plain, bounded by forests and lakes. This is supposed to be somewhere in northern Sweden, but was filmed in Hungary, and Aster, cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski and production designer Henrik Svensson have collaborated on what are surely digitally assisted images: the sky and fields becoming a bouquet of vivid and beautiful blues and greens. The music from British composer Bobby Krlic (AKA the Haxan Cloak) is sensually creepy.It’s a thoroughly enjoyable film, a crescendo of paranoid trippiness building to an uproarious grossout in its final moments – of which the poster image, incidentally, gives you no clue. Once we are in that weirdly unreal Swedish clearing, the narrative turbulence clears and things appear initially as calm as a millpond. Yet there is a point to that becalmedness. It helps create the ambient disquiet.Pugh is very good as Dani, a young woman in a failing, clingy relationship with Christian (Jack Reynor), and when a family tragedy plunges her into a terrible depression, Christian realises that he can hardly now take the course that some of his friends had been urging: that is – dump her. So, with a heavy heart, and to his friends’ dismay, Cameron asks her along on the summer trip he and the guys had been planning: a visit to a remote rural Swedish community for the “Midsommar” festival that happens only every 90 years and is a huge secret from the rest of the world.They only know about it because Christian’s sweet-faced friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) comes from this community and they all are to be his guests. He is very attentive to Dani and is the model of gentlemanly graciousness. This is in contrast to Christian and his boorish buddies, some of whom are would-be graduate students, planning to write doctoral theses on pagan rituals and hoping that the “midsommar” event will provide gloriously undiscovered primary research material. And in a way it will.When they all arrive, Dani’s mood miraculously begins to lift: the strange traditions and quaint white robes are enchanting. It seems like a heaven-sent cure. But wait. The shrooms she is invited to take induce weird feelings and the village elders are a bit evasive about what precise form the ceremonies will take. It’s kind of strange that, as she dances round the maypole with the other womenfolk, Dani discovers that she can speak Swedish. And the central plain is dominated by what looks like a florally decorated crucifix with wrist-sized loops on either side of the crossbeam. Uh oh.Midsommar combines mischief with a sensual surrender to fear and a dreamlike loosening of your grasp on reality. The Scandinavian setting gives hints of the various sacrificial moments in Roy Andersson’s Songs from the Second Floor (2000) or maybe even Carl Theodor Dreyer’s Day of Wrath (1943).The juxtaposition of the bright sunshine of the film’s main event with the dreary winter snow of its opening scenes is nicely managed. It’s a clever cut when Dani runs sobbing to the bathroom, the door slams shut and you realise you’re not where you thought you were. This solstice of savagery is its own reward. It would be great if the trailer gave us some hints of the yuckiest moments, together with a booming bass voiceover: “This sommar …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd1901e326e69c624b6cd2032fdba1bcc2e0b7fe/0_6_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6281de191a4b297c31c2e2be173180a6","title":"kim joys recipe for duck pond themed pavlova","story":"Dive into a luxury cream and coulis-filled meringue, with suitably quackers decorationIf you can make a pavlova (or even if you haven’t made meringue before), you can definitely make this decorated version.

Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Zest the lemons – if you haven’t got unwaxed (or organic) ones, give them a good scrub with hot water to remove some of the wax first, because this will give a better flavour.If you’ve forgotten to take the butter out of the fridge, cut it into cubes and leave it near the warm oven or give it a few good whacks with a rolling pin to help it on its way. (Microwaving will just melt the outside, which isn’t ideal.) Put the cubed butter in a large bowl, or in the bowl of a food mixer, with the caster sugar, a pinch of fine salt and half the lemon zest.Use electric beaters to beat the butter and sugar mix until it’s really light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary this should take about five minutes. You can do this with a wooden spoon, but it will take a while, because you want to get as much air into the mix as possible.Beat together the eggs in a jug, then beat them into the butter and sugar mixture a little at a time, making sure each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding any more. If the mixture threatens to curdle at any point, add a little of the flour to bring it back to a smooth consistency.Tip the flour into a sieve and sift it on top of the butter and sugar mixture – though this is not vital, it will help to give a lighter, fluffier result, so I’d recommend it. Use a large metal spoon gently to fold in the flour with a slow, figure-of-eight motion, being careful to knock as little air out of the mix as possible.Put the ground almonds in a bowl, give them a quick whisk to break up any lumps, then fold into the batter in the same way as the flour. Gradually mix in just enough milk to thin down the batter to a consistency that will reluctantly drop off a spoon.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and gently level the top.

Derby County, whom Lampard took to the Championship play-off final in his solitary campaign in charge, are understood to have received in excess of £4m in compensation for their manager, who will be joined back in south-west London by his assistant, Jody Morris, and fitness coach, Chris Jones.Chelsea, who lost Sarri to Juventus last month after a difficult year in charge, had been granted permission to open talks with their preferred target last week, with the Derby owner, Mel Morris, putting the subsequent delay in completing a deal down to the 41-year-old having been on holiday. Lampard is believed to have received assurances from the owner, Roman Abramovich, in the period since that he will be given time to make a proper mark back at the club with Chelsea currently operating under a transfer embargo which will potentially extend through to the summer of 2020.That will severely restrict the club’s ambitions in the market – they have secured Christian Pulisic and Mateo Kovacic already this summer, having lost Eden Hazard to Real Madrid, and have a number of loanees who have returned – though Lampard has already expressed an eagerness to tap into the potential of the club’s youth-team set-up to bolster his options. His appointment is likely to be swiftly pursued by confirmation that Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi have signed new five-year deals at the club.As well as roles for Morris and Jones, Lampard is expected to promote the highly regarded Joe Edwards, who has been working in the academy and under-23 set-up, and Eddie Newton to his backroom staff. The latter has more recently overseen the progress of the club’s battalion of loan players.The finer details of Lampard’s arrival were being scrutinised by lawyers at Stamford Bridge on Wednesdaynight but the new head coach is expected to face the media for the first time as Chelsea’s head coach on Thursday. He will take the skeleton squad who have already reported back for pre-season to Dublin on Friday, with his first game in charge to be Wednesday’s friendly against Bohemians at Dalymount Park, before a second fixture against St Patrick’s Athletic three days later.A squad further reinforced by first-team players returning after extended summer breaks will then travel to Japan for subsequent games against Kawasaki Frontale and Barcelona before the end of the month. His first Premier League game in charge will be at Manchester United before Chelsea, as Europa League winners, compete in the European Super Cup against Liverpool in Istanbul.Derby are expected to confirm the former Netherlands international Phillip Cocu as Lampard’s successor at Pride Park. The 48-year-old made an impressive transition from player to manager during his time in charge of PSV Eindhoven, and is a free agent after leaving the Turkish club, Fenerbahce, last October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ec6a7e0a2de3dbcc1a90b024838efdff5b99f3/0_337_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b38affd624ee483f5feebd2ba3a144f","title":"how womens world cup has given a real buzz to girls football","story":"Experience of one north London school highlights impact of England team’s success For 14-year-old Keira Drummond, the best and most difficult moments of the women’s World Cup came within an hour of each other. “When England scored the equaliser, I was so happy because I really thought we would get into the final and that would have massively changed how people see the game,” she said. To her dismay, the England team crashed out of the tournament after Ellen White’s second goal was ruled offside by VAR and the captain, Steph Houghton, missed a late penalty.Nevertheless, Keira described the World Cup as the most exhilarating one yet. And she insists it has already had a huge impact on the girls’ team at Stoke Newington school. The captain, 15-year-old Davina Thakore, agreed, adding that the tournament had inspired many girls in their school and local area to play. “There’s been a good turn out for trials, tournaments and school games. There’s more of a buzz around it,” she said.The enthusiasm of the young players at the north London school is reflected across the UK. England’s women’s World Cup defeat to the USA was the most-watched British television broadcast of the year – with a peak audience of 11.7 million.Ian Bruce, a PE teacher at the school who coaches the team, said the landscape of women’s football has transformed over the last few years. “Since the women’s World Cup, there’s been a huge increase in people getting in contact. I’m getting emails every day. When I started this journey 10 years ago, I had to scramble around the school and pull girls out of lessons to ask them to play. But over the last few years, the growth of the women’s game has been amazing and the last few months, there’s a real buzz and a real energy.”Louise McGing, secretary of AFC Leyton, one of the largest women-only football clubs in the UK with more than 700 players, said the World Cup has boosted interest and participation in clubs like theirs. “We were created five years ago because we believe girls need a safe place to train, that was just for them, where they are the priority.”Bruce, who is also chair of women-only team AFC Stoke Newington, said he created it to catch the 16-year-old girls who might otherwise be put off playing football altogether. “I’d seen a lot of my best players go to other mixed clubs, but not enjoy it as much as playing it in school,” he said.McGing said that welcoming space they provide meant they’ve seen a erse cohort of players join recently, especially girls who have been harder to reach. “For the first time, we have players in hijabs, which is fab!” Historically, girls came through from mixed teams, but McGing said they are now seeing elite players coming through from girl-only squads.“We’re accessing more athletes that we didn’t have before,” she said. “A lot of girls who would have done athletics before are now trying football they’ve got the speed and stamina, and we just teach them the ball manipulation skills.”Former England player Claire Rafferty welcomes the increased interest and enthusiasm in women’s football, but said she wants to see a larger group of players and clubs benefit. “The biggest clubs are the ones that attract the biggest sponsors and thus are able to pay the players more. I’d like to see it more from the bottom up.”McGing said that the World Cup was an important step to normalising women’s football for everyone. “The World Cup showed we play just as strong a game as the men, but there’s less rolling around on the floor and less drama. It’s just about playing the sport properly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ca8ccd84daf1ed7bb55005e6fdc33465ece2f8/126_235_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=004fb4d91791245645fdfa92fee3beff","title":"netherlands sweden womens world cup semi final match report","story":"New Manchester United signing Jackie Groenen ensured the Netherlands finally got the better of an excellent Hedvig Lindahl in the Swedish goal, in extra time, to set up a final between the reigning world champions, the USA, and the European champions.“Well I just saw a nice angle and we’ve been discussing it for a few weeks now about me taking more shots,” said Groenen. ”The ball came nicely and I thought I should just do it.”“I wasn’t emotional at all after this game to be honest,” said Netherlands manager Sarina Wiegman. “It might come later. I don’t think it has sunk in yet.”A dull 90 minutes, perhaps the dullest of the tournament, saw a grey game under a grey sky stumble towards extra time scoreless.Neither the Netherlands nor Sweden had looked likely to make the breakthrough in Lyon, instead the former Chelsea and Arsenal goalkeepers Lindahl and Sari Van Veenendaal, both let go by their WSL sides, were arguably the stars and firmly in the shop window. But in the 99th minute Groenen, whose form had been a concern going into the World Cup, beat Lindahl from 20 yards with a low strike.The crowd were underwhelmed in the first half - the allegedly sold out stadium so patchy you could make out the ‘Olympique Lyonnaise’ in white seats across the top tier - and the play mirrored the lacklustre support. It was two evenly matched teams playing it safe.Lina Hunting came in for the suspended Fridolina Rolfo and Elin Rubensson remained in her starting position due to a late injury to Nathalie Bjorn in the warm-up, while a struggling Shanice van de Sanden was benched in favour of 22-year-old Bayern Munich forward Lineth Beerensteyn.Changes were minimal, contrasting heavily with the tactical chess from Phil Neville and Jill Ellis on Tuesday night. With the Dutch unable to carry out their usual orange march to the stadium, officials ruling out the 12-mile route from the centre on health and safety grounds, this was not the buzzing home-away-from-home that the Netherlands players had become a little accustomed to in the north.Sweden’s first chance fell to Stina Blackstenius, who scored against Canada and Germany on the way to Lyon, Sofia Jakobsson slipped a neat pass to the Linkopings forward overlapping on the right but her shot was hesitant and straight at Sari Van Veenendaal.A Dominique Bloodworth corner though, found the Dutch record goalscorer towards the far post but her powerful header was expertly nudged by the fingertips of Lindahl onto the bar.Van de Sanden received a raucous welcome when ushered into the fray with less than 20 minutes to play. And she immediately burst into life flying towards the Swedish box before earning a corner and thrusting her arms up and down trying to inspire some life into the limp match.In extra time though, it was Groenen that would prove the difference.The midfielder, who has grown into this tournament, darted towards the box and picked the ball up at the end of a nicely passing move before powering low past Lindahl.“The feeling? Well, what can I say? A feeling of emptiness really,” said Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson. “Everyone who has experienced it knows it. You’re not angry, you’re not sad, you’re not disappointed. Empty, that’s what I feel like right now.”The Netherlands meet the USA back in this stadium on Sunday afternoon, while Sweden, who beat England 2-0 in November, meet the Lionesses in the third place play-off on Saturday in Nice.‚“It’s about a medal and third is better than fourth so we’ll do everything to win it. It’s not a lot of time and we have to see if players who have played 120 minutes can play,” said Gerhardsson.

It was the Americans who made the most of their resources in the semi-finalThe game between the United States and England took women’s football to another level. It had everything you could want in a semi-final: two VAR decisions great goals by Ellen White (OK, with one pulled back for offside) a penalty a penalty save surprise line-up changes a tactical battle between the two managers, and, unfortunately for England, heartbroken fans.This World Cup was a turning point for the women’s game in England. The team have won a lot of respect around the world for their talent and the way they play. Since 2015 they have addressed some of the issues that have held them back for so long. The next goal if they want to really succeed is to work on the fine details that make the difference between winning and losing at the highest level.All three goals (four, if you include the one called offside) in the game came from horrible defending. I said from the beginning of the tournament that this was not going to be a competition with fantastic defending and that’s what we got in the semi-final. England – as well as the US – obviously need to tidy up their backline but, importantly, I really want to see England convert their penalties.Nikita Parris missed two spot-kicks during this tournament. Ellen White – who is their main goalscorer – doesn’t feel comfortable taking them. So it was up to the captain, Steph Houghton, a defender and not a specialist penalty taker, to do the right thing and step up to take the crucial kick against the US. That took courage but Steph didn’t look confident before she took the kick even if Phil Neville said after the game that England had practised hundreds of penalties. Watching from the other side of the pitch, I knew from the way she lined up in front of the ball that she was going to go to the goalkeeper’s right. That’s what goalkeepers are taught to see. Top penalty takers are also taught how to disguise which direction they will shoot. It’s these details that make the difference. To compound things, Steph also mishit the kick. There was no pace on the ball and it was not placed in the corner, making it easy for a well-trained goalkeeper to save. In my experience with the US team, we worked on penalties a year out from any tournament. Every day after practice we would all take a penalty – and that included us goalkeepers. Players get more comfortable and more confident over time. The coaches keep records about how players responded to penalty kicks and what they did in training. Those little details are what England seemed to neglect and can be the difference at the highest level.Alyssa Naeher had a great save in the first-half to confirm that no one is going to score against an American goalkeeper from outside the box. American goalkeepers are well trained and historically very strong, an area in which England have struggled down the years. It has been great to see Alyssa gain more confidence as the tournament has gone on.Starting Christen Press was a great decision from Jill Ellis. Christen can run up and down the sideline forever: she’s fit, she’s fast, and she scores goals. She should have played more minutes across the whole tournament by now, though. It’s been strange to see Carli Lloyd, who came into the England game as a late substitute, go from being the US team’s goalscorer to being the closer in tight games. That shows how much attention is being paid to game management by the US, and how much Carli’s calming presence, ability to hold the ball and intelligence is needed when the game gets hectic and stressful.That said, people have told me they want to see the US keep possession and go for another goal to close out a game. Instead, the tactic seems to be conservative: put five defenders at the back and head for the corner flag with the ball and wind down the clock. I understand why that can be a good idea but the message I get is that people would love to see the US play football for 90 minutes. We have quality players who can play with style and lock down the game in a less conservative way.Rose Lavelle has really made a name for herself in France. So many people are asking me to tell them all I know about her and I was sorry to see her leave the field injured. She will have just as big a mental challenge as physical to be ready for the final. If she gets fit in time she might still question her body and if she misses the final it will be heartbreaking for her – and fans.That’s why some US players will now be happy there are a few days break until the final. Crystal Dunn and Tobin Heath can run and run but Megan Rapinoe will benefit from some extra time out. Megan should look at missing the semi-final as a positive step towards having an amazing game in the final. Hopefully on Sunday, just like in 2015, the US team can take women’s football to an even higher level."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb52b9c2a7be240357744e76e2646cde0940220/0_360_3572_2144/master/3572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ef64bbb11130df35d3120e8fd10b0b2","title":"womens world cup means so much england usa readers","story":"The tournament has not just broken TV records. It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

In November, Ian Livingstone, the founder of Games Workshop and one of the leading lights of Britain’s industry, warned: “By removing certainty and many of the existing benefits of EU membership, it is feared that Brexit will hinder the UK industry’s ambition to be the best in the world.”A survey in March 2017, released the day after Britain invoked Article 50 and confirmed its intention to withdraw from the EU, revealed that more than two-fifths of the nation’s games companies were considering relocation. Fifty-seven per cent of UK games companies employ workers from the EU, and at those companies EU workers represent, on average, a third of all employees, according to UKIE, the industry body that carried out the research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

He has always fiercely protected his privacy while building up a business empire that includes the Spectator and the Yodel delivery company.The brothers are famous for owning the Channel island of Brecqhou, where they have built a gothic-style castle, and their long-running dispute with many residents on the neighbouring island of Sark. They have clashed with local politicians and other residents in the tiny crown dependency over the decades, while helping to abolish one of the world’s last remaining feudal systems. After successfully bringing democracy to the islands they subsequently closed down their businesses when voters failed to back their preferred candidates.Clermont-Tonnerre acknowledged that his play, which does not mention the Barclays by name but features two wealthy Britons who live in a castle on Brecqhou, was partly inspired by the lives of the brothers.But he defended his right to freedom of expression and said the play had been commissioned to explore the issues around the continued existence of medieval Norman law in the Channel Islands, while ruminating on the nature and future of capitalism.Barclay had asked for €100,000 (£90,000) in damages for libel and violation of privacy and sought to have the work banned from being performed.The court instead ordered Barclay, 85, to pay €6,000 in moral damages to the playwright, as well as €5,000 to each of the three theatre companies involved in producing the play for infringing their right to show the work.

The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck! Warm fuzzy comedy from the king of smooth: guess the animal pattern pants, guess the animal sound, and then the surreal banter with the BBC journalist! When she asks, “When are you going to start?” Jeff casually replies, “Well, I think I already have” to an uproarious, loving crowd. Thanks for an amazing memory Jeff! Gary McKillion, 43, BarnstapleThe IICON stage was absolutely incredible. Obviously I loved the music, but I couldn’t believe how amazing the stage design was. It looked like something out of a dystopian future: proper way to listen to electronic music. Zach, 25, BristolThe Killers absolutely smashed it! We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

Frustrated by more than a decade of research which claims to reveal intentions, feelings and even consciousness in plants, more traditionally minded botanists have finally snapped. Plants, they protest, are emphatically not conscious.The latest salvo in the plant consciousness wars has been fired by US, British and German biologists who argue that practitioners of “plant neurobiology” have become carried away with the admittedly impressive abilities of plants to sense and react to their environments.Bothered by claims that plants have “brain-like command centres” in their root tips, and possess the equivalent of animal nervous systems, the critics counter there is no proof of sentient vegetation or structures within plants that would grant them what the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio has called “the feeling of what happens”.Taiz told the : “Our criticism of the plant neurobiologists is they have failed to consider the importance of brain organisation, complexity and specialisation for the phenomenon of consciousness.”The broadside drew a robust response from the University of Sydney’s Monica Gagliano, who conducts research on the cognitive abilities of plants, including perception, learning, memory and consciousness. She said the criticisms failed to take account of all the evidence and focused only on work that supported the authors’ viewpoint. “For me, the process of generating knowledge through rigorous science is about understanding the evidence base behind a claim,” she said. “Where is their experimental data? Or are we expected to just accept their claim at face value?”Taiz draws on work by the US researchers Todd Feinberg and Jon Mallatt, who explore the origins of consciousness by comparing simple and more complex brains in animals. They conclude that while animals ranging from insects and crabs to cats and monkeys have sufficient brains to be conscious, other organisms fail the test. Those organisms include plants, Taiz argues.The debate is shaping up to be the biggest botanical bunfight since the Romantic era when plant biologists argued for more than a century about sex in plants. As the purists argued nothing so obscene would be happening in flower beds, extremists on the sex side envisioned plants not only having sex but being full of lust and passion.Taiz believes the rise of plant neurobiology is driven by the environmental crisis that poses an ever-increasing threat to life on Earth.“They want to raise people’s consciousness about plants as living organisms and reach them on an emotional level. I’m very sympathetic to the motivations, but it is clouding their objectivity. They have to be prepared for the fact that plants may not have consciousness,” he said. “It’s bad science. It takes the whole scientific enterprise and reduces its credibility.”But Gagliano is having none of it. “If we think we already know how things are and fail to continuously question our own assumptions, but construct our claims on a system of beliefs we are dearly attached to, then we are in deep trouble and miss the opportunity for true scientific discovery to occur.“Miserably, this opinion piece seems yet another missed opportunity, one that makes strikingly no headway towards a better scientific understanding of what consciousness is.”Where the debate leaves Prince Charles, who not only talks to his geraniums but positively instructs them, is unclear. “Far be it from me to criticise Prince Charles, or anyone else for that matter, for talking to their plants,” Taiz said. “I would indeed be concerned, however, if they ever talked back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

At balmy Chester-le-Street they defeated New Zealand by a massive margin, thereby securing their semi-final slot at Edgbaston next Thursday against either India or Australia.England won by 119 runs in a match remarkably devoid of tension. It was not a perfect performance. There was the reassuring bonus of another brilliant start via the bats of Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, who struck another hundred, just as fluent as the one against India in their other “quarter-final”. But then England lost their way in the last 20 overs of their innings. In that time they mustered only 111 runs for the loss of seven wickets, chicken feed by modern standards. Nonetheless their total of 305 for eight proved more than adequate.Yet beyond that batting blip there were those moments that trigger thoughts that England’s ultimate goal is within reach, some of brilliance, some of outrageous good fortune, the sort that so often seem to accompany a side on a roll. Most of them happened in the field, where England benefited from two obvious strokes of luck. Henry Nicholls was given lbw to his first ball from Chris Woakes but, after consultation with his partner, he declined to review. The replay demonstrated that the ball would have sailed over Nicholls’s stumps.More significant was the dismissal of Kane Williamson, who never fails. Ross Taylor drove straight and hard the ball flicked the outstretched fingers of Mark Wood and hit the stumps with the Kiwi captain stranded – and out for 27. This is the equivalent of dismissing Virat Kohli cheaply. Without him at the helm the New Zealand side was neutered.But there was brilliance, too. Jos Buttler, ing to his left, held a superb one-handed catch down the leg-side to dismiss Martin Guptill, who has often troubled England. Only a curmudgeon could mumble, “Well, he’s got gloves on, hasn’t he?” after that. Bob Taylor, Alan Knott and Jack Russell would have been proud of that one. Soon afterwards Taylor was run out when attempting a second run. It was a misjudgment on his part but maybe he had bargained that the fielder was only Adil Rashid. Maybe he forgot that England’s weakest fielder is also their most improved as Rashid gathered and sent the perfect throw back to Buttler.With the Kiwis 69 for four and anxious not to do immeasurable damage to their net run rate the contest was just about over. Tom Latham played his first significant innings of the tournament but this brought only minor respectability to the total. However, it was sufficient to make Pakistan’s prospects of overtaking New Zealand in the table remote. Apart from Latham only an obstinate streaker delayed England’s stroll to the semis.So it did not matter that from 30 overs onwards the England innings had stuttered badly. It resembled the managerial career of Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Old Trafford last season, starting absolutely brilliantly, ending in grim decline, yet producing a reasonably satisfying outcome, one that would have been acceptable before a ball had been bowled – or kicked.Roy looked most vulnerable against the first delivery of the match from the left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner, which somehow squeezed past his leg stump for four byes. Then he began to time the ball exquisitely, as did Bairstow. Williamson shuffled his bowlers rapidly but this did not make much difference. After 10 overs England had 67 on the board with Bairstow’s cover drives skimming over the fielders in the circle and Roy’s pull shots finding distant boundaries.Roy reached his half-century in 55 balls, Bairstow in 46. In the 19th over Roy departed amid much self-disgust after driving straight to Santner at extra cover, but this did not cause much deceleration Joe Root stole his singles while Bairstow effortlessly purred to another century. But after Root’s dismissal batting suddenly became a trial, with frustrated batsmen staring at the surface as if it was some kind of treacherous chameleon.Root had gloved a hook shot against Trent Boult and curiously requested a review. This type of dismissal is often disparaged as “a strangle”, which is a mistake. The leg-side catch has been a regular occurrence in this tournament against fast bowlers who can conjure surprising bounce. Mature batsmen recognise that this type of dismissal is not a consequence of bad luck, but bad judgment. No doubt that will eventually be the analysis of Root.Bairstow followed in the next over, bowled off the inside edge and the slide had started. The promoted Buttler holed out to mid-off Ben Stokes kept mistiming the ball to fielders he summoned a new bat, which made no difference, before being caught at long-on for 11 off 27 balls, an aberration on his home ground against some of the cricketers he knew as a youngster. Until yesterday Stokes’ batting in this tournament had been exemplary.England were grateful for a canny innings from Morgan and a little late flurry from Liam Plunkett and Rashid which dragged the score past 300. In the end this was more than enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51f09ae0f56819815d686739dec01c149b0d4613/437_774_7149_4290/master/7149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d388211c60fe258db6535955a8b80982","title":"katherine ryan interview comedy single mum glitter room","story":"The queen of the caustic punchline talks about plastic surgery, embarrassing her daughter – and turning her life as a single mum into a sitcomKatherine Ryan is busily scrolling through a neighbourhood Facebook group when we meet. “Someone’s dog attacked another dog today which was sad,” she says, “but mostly people are just selling things.” However, her days in north London might be numbered. “I’m just ready to be a bit country,” she explains. Back in 2007, when she arrived in the UK, Ryan headed straight for Crouch End, where a gaggle of fellow Canadian comics had already settled down, and where she now spends her days mooching around in a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit she bought when Paris Hilton was at her peak.But the 35-year-old is now ready for a change. Her itchy feet are particularly understandable when you consider just how much has happened in the last 12 years. Previously a staff trainer for the Hooters restaurant chain in Canada, Ryan arrived in London with her then boyfriend, didn’t think she’d stay long and flitted between London and her tiny home town of Sarnia, Ontario. Her comedy career was in its infancy (“I was definitely doing an impression of Sarah Silverman”) but watching the likes of Sara Pascoe made her fall for London’s standup scene, and put down roots in the city. She worked a 9 to 5 job, had a daughter, Violet – who is now 10 – and became a single mum when her relationship with Violet’s father ended. “I didn’t even have a phone when she was born. A poor mum is a good mum,” she deadpans.However, Ryan was also slowly ascending from open mic nights to panel shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats and on to her current position as Gen Y’s answer to Joan Rivers. She’s best known for caustic punchlines verging on the unsayable, and gigs on programmes like (the fairly mean-spirited) Your Face Or Mine?, where couples have to decide whether they’re more attractive than one another. In a meta twist, she also presented the UK reboot of Rivers’ gilded doc series How’d You Get So Rich? Ryan once quipped that the late comic “got exactly what she wanted from that final surgery – to stop ageing”.We are snatching an hour at the Ace hotel in London amid Ryan’s busy schedule, ostensibly to talk about her new Netflix special, Glitter Room, but Ryan is soon giving her opinion about everything from Cardi B (“She’s just like, yeah I was a stripper – I love the fact that she’s so open”) to her tiny, “unethical” teacup dogs. She’s got an animal rights event lined up straight after, and is a big fan of the kind of canines her mate Danny Dyer describes as “dogs that shiver and piss from their eyes”.Ryan is warm, lightly cynical, and a bit of a magpie – she marvels at our waitress’s luminescent makeup, and is herself dressed in a diamanté-studded denim jacket and black tutu with big, Lady Gaga-esque sunglasses by her side. She is unusually interested in the harried freelancers hunched over their laptops in the hotel lobby, a situation she can relate to as well as the Netflix special – her second, following 2017’s In Trouble – she’s currently writing a sitcom for the streaming service. The Duchess, a “heightened version” of her life, will, she says, offer something a bit different from the sadcoms that have dominated TV in recent years. “My character is a bit of a fish out of water – she’s this brash, disruptive, North American mother who doesn’t act like you would think a mother would act. And she’s happy about being a mum! I don’t feel like it’s a drag. I think you can still be taken seriously, you can still be fashionable, you can still have fun,” she says, before pausing. “Do you think we should sadden it up a bit?”However, even if the tears are few, there’s a realism that’s never far from the surface with Ryan’s work. In both her sitcom and Glitter Room – previously seen on tour and in the West End – her hyperbolic, cutting gags often centre on motherhood, and single motherhood in particular. “The Glitter Room is Violet’s bedroom,” Ryan explains. The show is “about how proud I felt when I bought us our first property ever, a tiny flat. We decorated it to be really feminine, yet still in 2018 builders would notice that I was alone and be like, ‘That’s so sad, where’s the man?’ Or ‘You don’t want all those flowers – no man will want to live here.’”In her own experience, there’s still a sense of judgment around single motherhood, even within showbusiness, where she says she’s constantly asked, “Who’s watching your daughter?”, or “How have you explained your dirty mouth to her?”“Single dads are like sexy heroes,” she says, a subject she expands on live. “But if you’re a single mum there’s still a stigma.”The special was filmed in LA, where Ryan is less known than in the UK. “It really felt like proving myself, like you would do at an open mic or a comedy club,” she says. “But I think that’s always the way it should be. I’ve seen shows where you can tell people have been laughing at a comedian’s jokes for a while and they shouldn’t have been. I think you always want to be able to show up and be treated really fairly – ruthlessly even – by an audience and that’s the only way you’re going to know if you’re really funny or not”.Ryan compares having been a single mum to being in the Brie Larson hostage film Room, “except at least in the film the mum had someone bringing her groceries”. While she and Violet are supremely close, Ryan is also careful to give her daughter as much privacy as possible, and refrains from posting pictures of her online.Meanwhile, there is a chance Ryan may move home – and that wouldn’t be the only change in her life right now. While filming the upcoming series of Who Do You Think You Are? back in Canada (“I was just like, please do not let my ancestors have slaughtered the indigenous population, please!”), she ran into her high school sweetheart, Bobby, whom she hadn’t seen in 20 years. “I genuinely have always loved him, always,” she says. “I don’t know if that’s the nostalgia of your first love and being 16, but he walked in and I was like, wow. Then I just slept with him for an anecdote. I thought, he’ll go back to his friends and tell them and have a laugh, I’ll tell my friends, they’ll have a laugh, but no, I just really liked him.” She pauses, before adding a pained “Uh oh!”Bobby’s still in Canada so they’re taking things slowly. However, Ryan feels conflicted about the whole thing given her current projects. “It’s annoying because I have the special coming out where I’m going, right I’m not going to have a boyfriend again until I’m in my 60s. I also don’t want to abandon people. I’ve spent all this time talking to women who feel there is this culture that’s like, ‘She has all these cats and she says she doesn’t want a boyfriend but she’s lying, she’s incomplete.’ I hate that, because I felt very happy and very complete.”In any case, she isn’t about to start extolling the virtues of being coupled up. “Men are like dolphins – best enjoyed on holiday,” she quips in Glitter Room, and she’s still keeping Bobby “under review” she says. “I’m like, whatever happens, I don’t want to be in love, I don’t want to be in a relationship and I don’t want to get married.” Then she bursts out laughing and flashes a sardonic smile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30f981393bfb53e871be0766c9a3ad0c2965aad/0_0_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e1f5bbbf4b2cbc2f2c887818780f2c","title":"instagram whatsapp facebook media files outage","story":"Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp were malfunctioning throughout most of the day on Wednesday and into the night.

In April, a  article argued that while Fleabag is “a work of undeniable genius”, those who did not recognise themselves in it were being drowned out.Asked what her reaction was when people describe her as being privileged, Waller-Bridge said it was “absolutely probably true” that many people do not have the same opportunities she did to be able to make “their Fleabag”.But she took umbrage with criticism about the substance of her work as related to her background.“To criticise a story on the basis of where the author had come from, or how privileged the author is, undermines the story,” she told the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day.“I’ve never pretended that I’m not from a privileged position, I really know that I am … I was perfectly set up to have success in the world.“I suppose some of the criticism is that it was ‘just for posh girls’ and what I loved was that people were sending me photos of tweets ...

She also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, one of the most prestigious such institutions in the UK.However, she said she had “really, really worked for it” and that her privilege in itself had not created Fleabag, though she conceded the tale was told through the prism of a middle-class family.“I created Fleabag, but from a point of place in my life where I was able to sit and write, and I was able to take the time, and I was around people who could support that,” said Waller-Bridge, who also wrote Killing Eve.“I like to think that whatever life I’d lived, wherever I’d been born or brought up, I would still have written if I had been given the encouragement, and actually that’s the thing that I care about, encouraging people to do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf74a1796a78482541c69e51a94f55b8e7b998a2/56_83_897_538/master/897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29dde357cca6004cd83ff23d626a1e55","title":"ice us immigration messages raids","story":"In 2017, agents made plans to apprehend more than 8,000 people and described the work as ‘fun’US immigration officials planning countrywide raids targeting thousands of undocumented immigrants wrote cheerful messages about the potential arrests, wishing one another “Happy hunting!”, jokingly calling the initiative “Operation Super Epic Mega”, and saying the work was “fun”, records show.The records, obtained by the immigrant rights groups Mijente and Detention Watch Network, were released the same week that the not-for-profit news organization ProPublica uncovered a secret Facebook group where Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers posted racist, misogynistic and violent content about immigrants and Democratic members of Congress.And their release comes as Donald Trump renewed his threat of fresh Ice raids, after calling off a coordinated action targeting undocumented immigrants across the country in late June.The 2017 raid was ultimately canceled, after plans were leaked to the media. But the email records provide a detailed look at the broad and aggressive way Ice targets communities. The documents also offer insight into the culture of the agency, where some officers seem to talk about deportations in a celebratory, joking and excited manner.“The way that the lists are being created is really terrifying,” Jacinta Gonzalez, a Mijente organizer, told the . “The documents show just how politically motivated these raids are … It also just shows that the emphasis is on numbers and not on safety in any way, shape or form.”Matthew Bourke, an Ice spokesman, said the agency did not have “arrest quotas” and that operations were “not based on competition or meeting a specific threshold”.The emails also included a range of controversial language. In one email, an Ice official said his office was “responsible for 240 targets, which is due on September 12th”, signing off with, “Happy hunting and target building!”An assistant field office director in San Bernardino, California, who was confused about whether the operation was called “Epic” or “Mega”, wrote: “I propose we call it Operation Super Epic Mega sonic.” Someone responded that “they … changed the name to Epic!! It was Trumppped!!” Another email labeled “Fugitive Operations” celebrated the name change, saying, “It’s gonna be EPIC!”One email exchange mocked a news article in the York Daily Record, a local Pennsylvania paper, about educating immigrants on their rights. “I’m sure the 4 people that read ydr, never even got to that story!” an Ice official wrote.Another Ice official seemed enthused about the coming raids, writing in an email, “Here we go!!!!” In a July exchange about the operation and targets, a deputy field office director in Texas told one group, “You guys are crushing it,” and the recipient responded, “Thanks, guys are having fun.”In Austin, an Ice official was enthusiastic about detentions, saying, “We had more apprehensions today than any other day during this operation. Awesome job!!”In one August planning email, an official asked another person if they would like to be on an “arrest team” and the person responded: “YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!”Combined with the recent report on the offensive CBP Facebook group, the new Ice records suggested systemic problems among the different agencies involved in immigration enforcement, said Gonzalez: “They have a department-wide problem … They frequently say inhumane and offensive things that are meant to dehumanize.”Bourke, the Ice spokesman, said in an email that the agency “does not condone the use of offensive or politically-charged language in reference to agency enforcement operations”, adding that “any employee found to have acted in a manner that negatively portrays the agency … or embarrasses the agency … will be held accountable and may be subject to disciplinary measures”.He said officers were “expected to conduct enforcement humanely, respectfully and with professionalism”, adding: “ICE operations are driven by the agency’s mission to enforce the nation’s immigration laws and to uphold national security, border security and public safety.”The records also included an Ice presentation about immigrants’ constitutional rights, which Gonzalez said was a good reminder that communities should be informed about the laws that protect them and that people should keep pressure on the agency.“We must continue to be organized, and we must continue to defend our rights,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab08a5760e7210afceaf9c61869a55a444b1b2b/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33ff4280ba10050d7f1b506510ca620d","title":"canada joshua boyle afghanistan taliban hostage trial","story":"The trial of Joshua Boyle, the former hostage of a Taliban-linked group in Afghanistan who was accused of violence against his wife, has resumed after the court ruled it would hear testimony about the couple’s sexual history.Boyle was arrested at the couple’s former Ottawa apartment on New Year’s Eve 2017, just two months after he and Caitlan Coleman were released from five years of Taliban captivity.Boyle and Coleman had three children while in captivity.Boyle’s trial began in March. He faces 19 charges, including sexual assault, assault, unlawful confinement and administering a noxious substance.But a delay in proceedings was triggered by questions of whether the court should hear testimony about Coleman’s sexual history.In April, Ontario court judge Peter Doody ruled that he would allow defence lawyers to introduce evidence alleging Boyle and Coleman had previously engaged in acts of bondage and discipline (BSDM).Coleman’s attorney appealed the decision on the basis of Canada’s “rape shield” law that prevents past sexual history from being presented as a way to establish consent or patterns of sexual behaviour.In June, an Ontario superior court judge allowed Boyle’s defence to present the evidence.The trial was further delayed this month after the judge asked the crown and defence to consider whether a recent supreme court of Canada ruling on sexual history would impact Boyle’s case.The supreme court recently ordered new trials in two cases where the rape shield laws were not upheld in court.Coleman’s cross-examination continued on Wednesday. Coleman, who is an American citizen, is testifying via video link from the United States.According to the Canadian Press, defence attorney Lawrence Greenspon asked Coleman whether she had engaged in consensual sex or BDSM activities with Boyle after their return to Canada.She said they had, but that the encounters were not her idea.

The auction house, it said, replied to confirm it had the documents, but provided no proof and did not show any documentation to the embassy.Egyptian officials raised the alarm after the listing was made public, concerned that the 28.5cm-high statue was removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor. The statue “looks like it came from Karnak”, said Zahi Hawass, Egypt’s former minister of antiquities.It shows the young pharaoh Tutankhamun with the facial features of Amun, “a device used to align the ruling ing with deities”, according to Christie’s description.The listing adds that the statue was acquired as part of a lot from the Munich-based dealer Heinz Herzer. Last December, Italy’s leading court forced the Getty Museum in California to return an ancient Greek statue by the sculptor Lysippos to Italy, after the museum paid Herzer almost $4m for it in 1977.“It is hugely important to establish recent ownership and legal right to sell which we have clearly done. We would not offer for sale any object where there was concern over ownership or export,” Christie’s told the  when contacted to comment on the original listing.The auction house later confirmed sale on 4 July would go ahead and said they they had been in touch with both the embassy and the Egyptian ministry of antiquities about the sale.“We have provided extensive information about the Amun Head including our full cataloguing. We have also invited them to meet with us to review the work and discuss the provenance and accompanying documentation. They have not yet taken us up on this offer but we remain happy to welcome them to discuss this object and our processes,” Christie’s said. Adel disagreed. “The sale of such precious Egyptian artefacts is a huge shame and reflects a deep lack of respect to our efforts to stop this happening,” said Adel. He added that the auction house was ignoring “moral and ethical considerations related to the preservation and protection of cultural rights and properties worldwide”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95fd60d3066b50e9afefe28a51239838f14cc680/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e6683b090ba242c2e28ca2446d125c6","title":"eu top jobs explained who is coming in and what is their role","story":"From Ursula von der Leyen at the European commission to Christine Lagarde at the ECB, your guide to key EU jobsby  Daniel Boffey in BrusselsJob spec: Established in the 1957 treaty of Rome, the president of the European commission leads the EU’s executive branch, chairing a cabinet of 28 commissioners known as the college, and setting the bloc’s policy agenda over a five-year term. The commission president designate is nominated by the 28 heads of state and government, but they must be elected by a simple majority in the European parliament to formally take on the role. Von der Leyen will be the 13th commission president, and will be the first woman in the post if parliament supports her in a vote in mid-July.Job spec: The 2007 Lisbon treaty created the current role of a full-time president, appointed by the leaders, who serves a two-and-a-half-year term, with a one-time possibility of renewal. The president represents the EU on the world stage and chairs summits of the European council, the body on which the 28 leaders sit to give the EU its political direction. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, who is in a caretaker role as negotiations over a new government continue, will be the third such president of the European council. The convention is that the role is filled by former heads of state and government.Job spec: The ECB is responsible for the monetary policy of the 19 EU member countries that have adopted the euro and acts as central supervisor of their financial institutions. Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the bank has been responsible for monetary policy in the euro area since 1 January 1999.The bank’s president is technically “first among equals” on the governing council that sets the eurozone’s interest rates, but every word issued by the incumbent moves the markets. Mario Draghi’s commitment to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro in large part saved the currency.The role demands specialist knowledge. Although Lagarde is not an economist, her experience as the outgoing managing director of the International Monetary Fund and as a former French finance minister is regarded by the leaders as being sufficient for the role. The post is filled by the European council after consultation with the eurozone group and the parliament.Job spec: The president acts as the speaker of the house, chairing debates in the plenary and ensuring parliamentary procedures are followed. They also represent the 751-strong chamber to the world. The term is for two and a half years, which can be renewed once. To be elected, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the valid votes cast. Technically, the election of a president is decided by the MEPs, but the heads of state and government, as key members of their political groups, have a heavy say. The new president, Sassoli, is a member of the Socialists and Democrats group, which lost out on the commission presidency.Job spec: The idea was that the holder of the post would shape and execute the EU’s foreign and security policy and lead the EU’s diplomatic corps, the European External Action Service. The lack of consensus among the member states on policy has undermined the original vision. The leaders appoint the holder of the post by a qualified majority vote, but the president of the commission must agree with the decision. Spain’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, 72, will be the fourth high representative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a953d867a6401adccd879470e7329c02b4cd23/0_109_1180_708/master/1180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf03fca5e56c821eefc391aec5def91","title":"volcano erupts in italian island of stromboli","story":"Residents evacuated as fire crews tackle blaze on west coast of StromboliA volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli has erupted, killing a hiker, throwing ash high into the sky and enveloping the popular tourist destination in smoke.Rescue services said Wednesday’s eruption on Mount Stromboli had started fires on the western side of the small Mediterranean island north of Sicily. Fire crews were being called in from nearby locations and a Canadair firefighting plane was already in action. One tourist who was hiking on the volcano was killed and another injured, local firefighters confirmed.Tourists often climb to the 924-metre (3,031ft) summit of the volcano and peer into its crater, from which small lumps of molten rock are regularly blasted into the sky.“It was like being in hell because of the rain of fire coming from the sky,” Italian news agencies quoted a local priest, Giovanni Longo, as saying.Michela Favorito, who works in a hotel near Ficogrande, on the east side of the island, said: “We saw the explosion from the hotel. There was a loud roar. We plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash, a fairly large cloud.”Thirty people were evacuated from the village of Ginostra by hydrofoil, and another ship was heading to pick up other tourists. The mayor of the nearby island of Salina, Domenico Arabia, said that beaches on the island had been closed as a precaution. Fiona Carter, a British tourist on the island of Panarea, 17 miles (27km) from Stromboli, heard the blast. “We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red-hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra,” she said.“The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely. Several boats set off for Stromboli.”Marco Neri, a volcanologist from Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, said eruptions were very rare on Stromboli: the last one was in 2007.The island was the setting for the 1950 movie Stromboli starring Ingrid Bergman and, with other islands in the Aeolian archipelago, has become a favourite location for holiday homes for the rich and famous."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945826.1562180930!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sitting leaving cert exam hours after appendix ruptured inhumane student","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmy Richards first visited the doctor with pain in her abdomen about a week before the State exams began. She was told not to worry and that she was suffering symptoms of stress and irritable bowel syndrome.Amy Richards cannot remember sitting her first English Leaving Cert exam on June 5th. She had undergone surgery after her appendix ruptured and became gangrenous just hours earlier.The 18-year-old slept for three hours following the surgery at Wexford General Hospital before her mother, at Amy’s request, woke her at 7.30am so she could cram before the exam.At 9.30am she sat down at one of the hospital dinner tables, picked up her pencil and started writing.“I have no idea what I wrote, I don’t know if it was complete gibberish,” she said. “During English paper 2 and maths paper 1 the nausea was horrific. The exams were interrupted on numerous occasions so I could receive pain medication and have my drip changed.“I was trying to write but all I could think about was getting sick. I had to end both exams early and ended up on the bathroom floor getting sick.”Amy first visited the doctor with pain in her abdomen about a week before the State exams began. She was told not to worry and that she was suffering symptoms of stress and irritable bowel syndrome.A few days later she was back with a GP, who immediately sent her to a hospital emergency department.“I don’t think I’ve cried so much in my life as I did that Tuesday. I was frustrated to be missing so much time for studying and when the doctor told me I had to go to hospital I had a panic attack and couldn’t breathe,” Amy says.“When I was told at 7pm that I had appendicitis I didn’t care, I just wanted to sit the exam. I was devastated, English was one of my strongest subjects and I needed it to get the high points for medicine.”Request refusedWhen the severity of their daughter’s condition became clear, her parents contacted her school and the State Examinations Commission asking whether she could reschedule and sit the exams in July with pupils who suffer a bereavement during the Leaving Cert. Their request was refused.Having sat the HPAT, an aptitude test for medicine applicants, earlier in the year and being determined to secure the high points needed to study medicine, Amy insisted on sitting the first three exams in hospital.After being discharged, she sat the remaining exams in a private room in her school during which time she remained on heavy medication including a strong painkiller and anti-nausea medicine.“At the end of the exams I had no sense of achievement. I don’t think people understand how wrong it is to force a child to sit the most important exam of their life when they’re extremely ill,” she said. “The surgeon had told my Mum I was lucky to be alive. If someone’s life is threatened they’re not fit to sit an exam.”Amy has resigned herself to the reality that she may not have done as well as she hoped in the exams. She is looking into medical courses abroad and if she secures enough points, may study science at an Irish university. She is also considering repeating sixth year, but would have to learn an entirely new two-year syllabus for English and music.A Department of Education spokesman said a new pilot scheme had been introduced to allow Leaving Cert students who suffer a close family bereavement during the exams to sit alternative papers in July.Any extension of this would need to take into account the difficult life circumstances some students encounter during exam time, but also the need to be fair to the majority of students sitting exams and “to maintain the integrity of the examinations process”, he said.A spokeswoman for the State Examinations Commission said it was scheduled to undertake a “comprehensive review” of how best to support students experiencing “all forms of trauma and adversity” at exam time.She added that “every possible effort” was already made to accommodate students who experience accidents, illness or other trauma either immediately before or during examinations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945766.1562176387!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"development around naas has led to weak town centre watchdog","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPR welcomed that the draft plan for Naas contained  a regeneration strategy for the stalled town centre. Naas Main Street. File photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe The new planning watchdog has called on Kildare County Council to amend its local area plan for Naas due to concerns it is facilitating increased development on the fringes of the M7 motorway to the detriment of the town centre.The Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) has expressed concern that the draft Naas Local Area Plan (LAP) 2019-2023 is continuing and intensifying the trend of the development of a “peripheral arc” alongside the motorway.An evaluation by the OPR of the five-year plan for Naas said there had been “a sustained shift towards the M7 motorway in recent decades” in terms of town development, which had increased car dependency among local residents.The OPR said such a shift had been followed by the rapid development of low-to-medium density housing which had resulted in “a weak town centre”.One of the key functions of the planning regulator, Niall Cussen, is to ensure that statutory plans and strategies of city and county councils are consistent with legislation and government policy in relation to planning.The regulator acknowledged the county council had identified the challenge of capitalising on Naas’s strategic economic role as a self-sustaining urban centre, while moving away from unsustainable forms of development.The draft LAP acknowledges that the development of Naas is “reaching a crossroads”.Car-based travelHowever, the OPR said housing sprawl around Naas and an excessive focus on development near the M7 would draw “car-based” economic activity, given its distance from where people lived.It said new land-use zonings proposed under the draft LAP for areas near the motorway were predominantly accessible by car rather than public transport and were in locations not attractive for walking or cycling.“There is an absence of an evidential basis for such zonings,” it said. “There is also a heavy likelihood that development in this area would be likely to add to traffic levels and energy intensive car-based travel.”The OPR said allowing such a trend to continue would undermine attempts to build a stronger and vibrant town centre and would lead to the lopsided development of Naas.The regulator said the council needed to revisit elements of the draft plan to ensure it was consistent with regional and national planning policy.It criticised the absence of a transport investment and delivery plan to facilitate the proposed development of significant new housing projects on the outskirts of Naas.The OPR also called on the council to show that developments near the motorway would not negatively impact on traffic flows to and from the M7.It welcomed that the draft plan for Naas, as Kildare’s key urban centre, contained many innovative and positive features including a regeneration strategy for a stalled town centre and the Corban’s Lane area, as well as the “under-utilised” Canal Harbour.The regulator also praised the council’s intention to use legislation governing derelict and vacant sites to move on stalled developments in the town.A council spokesperson did not respond directly to recommendations made by the planning regulator.However, the spokesperson said: “A report is currently being prepared for the elected members which will have regard to all submissions received on the draft LAP.”Under legislation the council’s chief executive is obliged to provide an explanation to the OPR if it does not accept the regulator’s recommendations.The OPR can make recommendations to Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy to direct the local authority to make changes to its development plans."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Kildare County Council called on to change plans for development near motorwayRomanian

july arrives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAndrew Grossen is an American living in Ireland. Photograph Nick BradshawThe During the summer of 2016, Minnesota native Andrew Grossen was interning with his state’s senator Amy Klobuchar in Washington, DC, in between academic semesters at University College Dublin. For the Fourth of July, the US holiday that commemorates the country’s declaration of independence, he got to watch the fireworks over the National Mall in the political heart of the country’s capital. It was the last year of the Obama administration, and Democrats looked set to maintain control of the White House. According to US pollster FiveThirtyEight, on that midsummer day, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had a 77.6 per cent chance of winning the presidential election the following November. Donald Trump, the political outsider and candidate for the Republican Party, was trailing her significantly. As he watched the celebrations that night, Grossen felt hopeful. “We were kind of wondering where this is going to go, but we still had that hope that it’s going to be okay,” he remembers. Now, more than two years into a Trump presidency, the Fourth of July is a more reflective and lower-key US national day of celebration for Grossen, who is still living in Ireland pursuing his master’s degree.He spent a year of his secondary school education in Tipperary and loved Ireland so much he returned to do his undergraduate degree in Dublin. Arriving on Irish soil during the Obama administration, there was a certain pride in being American. There were people who very critical of the US at that time, and that was to be expected, according to Grossen. But now, things feel different for him. “I still love my hometown, my home state and the people in America,” he says, but he finds there is a challenge there in conveying the view that opposing the American government is not opposing the American people. Irish people, according to him, overwhelmingly understand his position. Among the crowds at the anti-Trump protest in Dublin last month, “the people I saw and met really made that clear and welcomed me as an American in that protest”. The Dublin demonstration was one of many that took place across the country in response to the US president’s visit, and the 6m inflatable Trump baby blimp was on loan from London for the occasion. Salute to AmericaA month after his Irish visit, Trump is set to host a Salute to America celebration in Washington, DC, on the Fourth of July. He will deliver an address at the National Mall, the same stretch of monuments where Grossen watched the commemorative fireworks three years earlier. NBC News reported that top donors to the Republican National Committee were given the best tickets to the event. The event, US-born Wexford resident Wendy Connolly says, is “everything in America that we need to solve being celebrated”. Six years ago, Connolly attended one last Fourth of July celebration in her local town of Cerritos, California, before moving to Ireland. She remembers people from all sorts of backgrounds gathering in the town park, bringing all of their traditions to one place. Her local congresswoman, representative Loretta Sanchez from the Democratic Party, sat at a card table listening to her constituents’ stories and complaints. People brought food to the celebration, children played together, and a fireworks display crackled in the evening sky. “And I looked around, it was extremely poignant, and thought: ‘Yes.’ This was the snapshot of America that I want to bring with me,” Connolly recalls. “This is where the whole world washes up, brings its best, and starts to create something new. Needless to say, back then I had no idea how fragile that would be.” Connolly believes Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, whether you agreed with the minutiae of his administration or not, was civil and “represented America to other nations in a very capable and gracious way”. Now, she says, the first question out of people’s mouths when they hear her accent in Ireland is how does she feel about Trump. “There’s caution there and I don’t blame them in the slightest,” she says. Cause for celebrationHowever, for other Americans living Ireland, Trump’s presidency has been a cause for celebration. For former New York City police officer Thomas O’Hara, who is currently based in the Irish midlands, the president’s message of “America First” was appealing. According to O’Hara, Trump was the right man for the right time. Someone who wasn’t a politician, who was moving back to having pride in being American. In the wake of the US president meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last week, O’Hara says that predictions of war between the two countries under a Trump presidency turned out to be wide of the mark. “Look what’s going on now,” he says, “they’re talking.” For Thomas, this Fourth of July and the ones preceding it under a Trump presidency don’t feel any different. “I’ve always been patriotic,” he says, “I’ve always stood for the national anthem, saluted the national anthem. “So as a registered Republican, I’m happy, especially with what’s going on over there at the moment. It just seems the other side is trying to get away from everything American.” With the majority of Americans continuing to disapprove of Trump’s presidency, according to the latest polls, the country’s citizens both at home and abroad remain deeply ided along political faultlines. But, for Maureen Lancaster, an American living in Cork who splits her time between the US and Ireland, the Fourth of July offers a time for unity. “For me, it symbolises that hope that our generation can live up to the challenge and find a better way,” she says, “including those who support our current president in that effort, and not contribute further to the deep polarisation and isions within the American people.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945892.1562186172!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people are not spending their money here the slow recovery of naas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVacant shop fronts on the Main Street of Naas, Co.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The recovery from the recession has been slow for many business owners operating on Main Street in Naas, Co Kildare.The county’s population has risen in recent years and while housing is hard to come by in some areas, many commercial units lie empty.The half-finished shell of the Naas Shopping Centre, the building off Main Street which was abandoned during the financial crash, is a stark reminder of the investment needed to revive the town centre.“This town is crying out for an anchor,” says Martina Phipps, who has run the arts and crafts shop Tuckmill Gallery on Main Street for more than three decades.Phipps is proud of the “niche” stores the town offers, but says it can be difficult to buy everyday items and groceries.“If you didn’t know the town well you wouldn’t think you could buy a pint of milk here,” she adds.Over the years, the shopkeeper has seen larger retailers like Penneys and Superquinn pull out of the area.The town’s retail offerings have been dwarfed by popularity of the Monread Shopping Centre and a Tesco Superstore on the outskirts of Naas, the Whitewater Shopping Centre in Newbridge, and Kildare Village up the N7.Phipps finds the Tesco to be “far too big and cold, but of course there is free parking and you can’t argue with that”.A Dunnes Stores food hall is set to open in the middle of the Main Street in August, which has the potential to bring a lot of business back into the town, she adds.“There used to be a Superquinn in the centre, which was always such a busy spot. Hopefully now this will draw people back in.”Although retailers, such as herself, can avail of local government grants to repair or upgrade store fronts,\u0026nbspPhipps feels the council could do more to incentivise new business in the town.“It is a bit of a contention of mine because I grew up here and I saw things change,” she says. The rates are high, so there has been little uptake of units except for charity shops, which benefit from tax concessions, she adds.‘Lack of people’Some locals have taken matters into their own hands. The Naas Regeneration Group, formed by local businesses and other volunteers, started a town voucher scheme which aims to encourage people to shop locally.“Maybe it is baby steps, but it feels like we are gaining a little bit of momentum,” Phipps adds.Dressing the Main Street since 1980, Mary Fielding’s soft-furnishings shop, Finishing Touches, lost staff members and customers during the financial crash.Although Kildare is classified as the third-wealthiest county in Ireland, Fielding says neither her business nor her staff numbers have fully recovered from the crash.There is no doubt that online shopping has played a role, but the shopping complexes that opened on the town’s periphery have also been contributing factors, she says.While Naas is full of young couples, there is a “distinct lack of people in the town,” she adds, as many people who have moved to the area in recent years spend nearly all of their time in Dublin.New to the street, Charles McAvoy says he “took a risk” in choosing to open a men’s shoe shop just two months ago.“I will only know in about a year if that risk has paid off,” he says. “The town has a vibrancy, there is no doubt about that, but it is still quite depressed... Naas is supposed to be one of the wealthiest towns in Ireland. I would challenge that, because people are not spending their money here.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945932.1562189363!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us ambassador vows to try to enhance relationship with ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador to Ireland Edward F Crawford at the ambassador’s residence in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Photograph: Nick BradshawUS ambassador to Ireland Edward Crawford has spoken of his pride at being chosen for the role and said he intended to do everything he could to enhance relations between the nations.Speaking in front of a crowd that US chargé d’affairs Reese Smyth called “1,500 Irish friends”, Edward F Crawford (81) explained that US president Donald Trump had offered him an ambassador posting before he had even been elected.Asked by Mr Trump what country he would prefer, Mr Crawford responded: “Ireland”. When it was suggested that he give Mr Trump three choices, Mr Crawford said these were “Ireland, Ireland, Ireland”.Mr Crawford, a businessman from comes from Cleveland, Ohio, made his first public appearance as ambassador at an Independence Day garden party in the grounds of his residence in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. On a warm summer’s evening, he joked that he had brought the weather with him from the US.“I had dreamed about serving my country. I was approached by someone you know the name of before he was even elected. I have known him for some time,” he said.“I am going to do everything I can to enhance the relationship between America and Ireland – undeniably one of the strongest relationships. America was one of the first countries in the world to recognise Ireland.”Confirmation processHe recalled the arduous 17-month process between being nominated by Mr Trump and his confirmation as ambassador and paid the tribute to Mr Smyth, who effectively served as ambassador during the lengthy hiatus between appointments.Mr Crawford introduced his family on stage – his wife, Mary his son, Matthew his daughter-in-law, Deborah and their three grandchildren – Colin, Catherine and Claire. Matthew described his father as a “strong, smart and caring leader” and “one of the most successful charismatic and passionate business leaders from America”.His father’s story was “very Irish-American – a hardworking young man who started at the very bottom and then builds a big business one day at at time”.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar recalled that Mr Crawford’s parents had left Ireland in 1925 for the US and had passed through Ellis Island. The new ambassador’s mother, Kay, came from Co Cork.“They made the American dream their own. Today I can only imagine what it would mean to them to see their son return to Ireland as United States ambassador – the fulfilment of another dream,” Mr Varadkar said.He joked that Mr Crawford was not a week in the country and was already throwing the “best party of the summer”.Mr Varadkar said Mr Trump had given him a copy of an order sent by Gen George Washington to his troops in 1780 giving them the next day off, which was St Patrick’s Day. Washington did so, having called the Irish a “brave and generous people”.“We are two countries united by our shared heritage and our deep, abiding friendship,” Mr Varadkar said. “We are strong partners and in the years ahead we intend to work together trading and investing and creating employment on both sides of the Atlantic with almost as many people in America working for Irish-owned firms as there are Irish people working for American-owned firms.“Over the centuries, Ireland has benefited so much from the courage and generosity of the American people. For that we are forever grateful.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945896.1562186450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government denies it is at odds with michael creed over beef deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Creed has vowed to ‘thwart’ the EU’s Mercosur deal. File photograph: Tom HonanThe Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has said he intends to “frustrate”, “dismantle” and “thwart” the EU-Mercosur trade agreement in order to protect the interests of the Irish beef sector. Mr Creed’s comments on the EU agreement with four South American nations appear to be at variance with Government policy, which is to examine the deal “in the round” and carry out an economic and environmental assessment before a decision is made on whether to oppose it or not.A spokesman for Government and Mr Creed’s spokesman denied that the Minister was at odds with the Government position on the deal. However, his pledge to seek to ”thwart” the deal goes much further than anything Taoiseach Leo Varadkar or any other Minister has said on the matter to date.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that he would vote against the agreement if the economic and environmental assessments showed it to be against Irish interests and said that the Government would seek to protect Irish beef farmers. However, he said that the Government must recognise that Mercosur – a bloc made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – is “a market of 250 million people and while there may be losses for some sectors there could be significant benefits for others and we need to look at that in the round”. Under the deal, announced last week after some 20 years of negotiations, the EU has agreed to accept 99,000 tonnes of South American beef into its market each year, which farmers claim could cost the Irish beef sector up to €750 million annually.The deal, which is unlikely to be voted on for at least two years, also covers other sectors such as pharmaceuticals, services, machinery, and other food stuffs – including the importation of tens of thousands of tonnes of poultry and pig meat into the EU.Negative effectsMinister for Business Heather Humphreys told the Dáil that “there are benefits in certain sectors but there are also negatives” in the deal. However, Mr Creed went much further, saying he would not be found “defending the indefensible”. “I have stated my view clearly. I have a responsibility to use the time available to us following the announcement of a headline agreement between the European Commission and Mercosur states to ensure everything is done to frustrate and mitigate, dismantle the ambition and protect the interests of the beef sector,” he said, adding that environmental and climate change requirements could be used to “thwart” the deal.“Collectively, the challenge is to make progress on these matters in a way that will diminish the ambition of Mercosur.”Government sources pointed to Mr Creed being under pressure from the wider agriculture sector and in his constituency. Mr Creed’s comments did not go unnoticed in Brussels, with one senior European Commission source wondering if the Minister would resign due to being at variance with Government policy on the deal.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillDark memories of Kylie Minogue swept across Leo Varadkar’s mind and he was suddenly afraid.The Taoiseach paused, stopped in his tracks by thoughts of that breathlessly penned “Dear Kylie” note last year when he told the Aussie superstar he was a “huge fan!” and was really looking forward to seeing her in concert, and could he welcome her to Ireland personally as his office is right across the road from her hotel?He got dog’s abuse for doing that.Tina Turner turned up in the Dáil on Wednesday. There was no advance notice so no opportunity of a fanboy repeat for Leo.She surfaced during the long tributes to former Fianna Fáil TD for Galway West, Mark Killilea, who died in December.In fairness, this was not expected.The Leas Ceann Comhairle, Pat ‘the Cope’ Gallagher, was a great pal of the politician, who was a deputy back in the late 1970s and early 1980s before becoming a senator and then a long serving MEP.Pat remembered being on the election trail with “Markeen” in 1994 along with the music blaring from the campaign bus.“And when I go west of Ireland I still hear Tina Turner in my ear, singing ‘Simply the Best’. He felt he was simply the best and it was an exciting campaign.”The Taoiseach was 11 months old on the day Killilea first entered the Dáil, but he paid a warm tribute on behalf of his party to a fellow politician who was respected on all sides.“I didn’t have the privilege ever to meet Mark Killilea but I am delighted to learn today that we both shared a love of Tina Turner,” he began, before hurriedly adding: “but I’m happy to inform the House that we’re not currently in correspondence.”Fan mailA laughing Leo, hands up in mock horror, stressed his fan mail days were behind him.“Or ever, by the way, just in case you want to ask.”Labour leader Brendan Howlin recalled Killilea was in the thick of things during the turbulent Haughey era.“I suppose most political commentators remember the very odd . . . ,” he began, about to elaborate on those colourful days when he was struck by a thought: “You see, this Dáil – people think it’s very bizarre but it’s calm in comparison to the Dáil during that era.”So bizarre and boring are interchangeable words now.He looked back to the time Killilea was a junior minister for posts and telegraphs, when people often had to wait years to get a phone line into their home. They made representations to their local TDs in case they could influence the process. Howlin was told Markeen always kept a number of the old-fashioned handsets in his car and gave them to constituents.“They would still have to wait two years for the connection, but it would give them hope.”Meanwhile, the needle between the Taoiseach and leader of the main Opposition party continued to fester nicely.The flashpoint for Wednesday’s squabble was the Dunkettle roundabout.This legendary traffic interchange on the road to Cork city is earmarked for an upgrade under the Government’s much vaunted Project 2040 plan. But nothing much is happening and local man Micheál Martin is keen to find out why.He asked the Taoiseach to explain the delay, elaborate on the rumours of major cost overruns and say when construction will begin.The Taoiseach snippily remarked he was glad the Fianna Fáil leader supports the project because his spokespeople think some of the road projects should be reviewed.The only person to suggest such a thing was Senator Jerry Buttimer, bristled Micheál from Cork South Central, referring to the former Fine Gael deputy for Cork South Central.Well then, deflected Leo, apropos of nothing Micheál was asking, what projects do you want reviewed?He was told to stop being silly. People want to know when Dunkettle roundabout will be finished.“They want to know if you’re going to cancel the roads programme,” niggled the Taoiseach, inadvertently intimating that Fianna Fáil might be back in government soon.Carry-on“They don’t want to know about the rest of the roads,” groaned an exasperated Micheál. “They don’t believe in that silly carry-on. It’s just your press office on steroids.”The bickering continued later when the pair were at odds again over the funding and future of major projects, including Dunkettle. The Fianna Fáil leader asked for a response which wasn’t “petty, silly and idiotic”.Leo, just back from rubbing shoulders in Brussels with fellow European prime ministers, was in a truculent mood. Probably finding it difficult to be back among the domestic plodders having soared with political giants.One day being spoken of as a compromise candidate for president of the European Commission (flattered but not at the moment), the next dealing with Dáil accusations over housing, the minimum wage and a traffic intersection in Cork.No wonder he was a bit short with the locals.“I’m always amused and bemused that deputy Martin likes to accuse me of being partisan and personal, yet, as evidenced by his name-calling today he’s very capable of being partisan and personalised himself,” remarked Leo levelly.Micheál calls him petty, silly and idiotic.“Hold me coat!” says Leo, before he floors everyone with his strange reaction.“It kinda reminds me of one of those parish priests who preaches from the altar telling us to avoid sin while secretly going behind the altar engaging in any amount of sin himself.”Whoa! What did he just say?In the chamber, Micheál Martin was speechless.Elaine Loughlin of the Irish Examiner quickly tweeted the comment.“To be honest Elaine, I think this reflects more on the Taoiseach than anyone else,” he sadly concluded.Meanwhile, Michael Creed is cracking on with his plan to “thwart” the beef element of the Mercosur trade deal. With Irish farmers up in arms over the draft agreement, the Minister for Agriculture is vocally championing their cause.It’ll be no pantomime and it’s going to run for years, but Creed intends to ride to the rescue of beef farmers and scupper those aspects of the plan which are damaging to beef farmers by using a variety of disruptive tactics.White Knight and the Seven Thwarts – frustrate, dismantle, mitigate, delay, obstruct protest, outfox – whatever it takes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945748.1562174699!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poland and hungary s issue is with the eu not frans timmermans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission first vice-president Frans Timmermans addresses a news conference  in Brussels, Belgium, in February  2018. File photograph: Francois LenoirReutersAs I started to pen this missive – Tuesday – Frans Timmermans was still a runner to be the next European Commission president. By the afternoon the European Commission vice-president and socialist spitzenkandidat was “dead”, as a Dutch compatriot put it.The commission presidency nomination process had a quality of the Tory leadership race in the UK – instead of an “anyone-but-Boris” campaign, we had an “anyone-but-Timmermans” lobby, effectively defining the contest. Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister who won the job, may have many merits, but chief among them is that she is not Frans Timmermans.In the end it was about the price leaders were not willing to pay to preserve the EU’s liberal democratic ethos, for the sake of “unity”, as much as about the gender, geographical and party balance they claimed to be reconciling.Timmermans has been demonised – not just for his socialist affiliation, which is anathema to some on Europe’s right – and his failure will certainly be seen as a victory for the argument that maintaining “unity” in the union is the top political priority, ahead of treaty compliance on budgets or the rule of law.Placate, not confront, will be the order of the day.Brussels is being sent an implicit message to hasten slowly in its attempts to “put manners” on the more wayward member states: Poland, Hungary and Italy. And there’s already a straw in the wind that the message is being heard – on Wednesday, the commission delayed a decision on sanctioning Italy over its budget-busting spending plans.“The French and the Germans want to tell us what to do with the appointments, on immigration, about the economy, but when it comes to deciding they always look at their own national interest before the EU’s.”Dividing EuropeAs he arrived at the Brussels summit, Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned that “Frans Timmermans is the candidate who is strongly iding Europe. He certainly doesn’t understand central Europe, doesn’t understand\u0026nbspEurope, which is emerging now from the post-communist collapse.” He demanded that the candidates be chosen by “a big majority” or unanimously.\u0026nbspThe truth of course is that it is Timmermans’s powerful advocacy of the Article 7 proceedings against Poland and Hungary over the rule of law that is the real subtext of such Polish criticism – as local media commentary has made quite plain. Donald Tusk may have insisted at the summit that this was not an acceptable reason for opposing Timmermans, but no one was listening.Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orban, whose Fidesz party is suspended from the EPP over rule-of-law concerns, claimed in a similar vein that Timmermans is in the pocket of Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros. Budapest has been waging war against foreign-supported NGOs and Soros’s Central European University.\u0026nbsp“Timmermans is a good warrior and no mean opponent, for which he has my respect. He is an ideological warrior who accepts no ersity, who tolerates no views which erge from his own and from liberal democracy, and who wants to force his own conception on all EU member states,” Orban said.“The key issue here is that of large-scale financial support for Soros-style NGOs over the course of many years,” he added. “Several of us are seeking to stop this process.”His spokesman Zoltan Kovacs would proudly\u0026nbsptweet that\u0026nbspthey had “toppled Timmermans” and “put on the EU table” a package including Von der Leyen.Implementing policyIn truth, however, Timmermans has merely been robustly implementing the policy of the commission and European Council – and it was MEPs who decided to proceed against Hungary under the rule-of-law provisions of Article 7.Czech prime minister Andrej Babis, part of the Visegrád Group (V4) with Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, said he wanted a president without negative views about that region, and opposed Timmermans because of disagreement on immigration.Yet what is at issue here is not a failure to empathise with central Europeans’ unwillingness to embrace mass migration, but their refusal to accept that solidarity, or burden-sharing, is an essential component of what the EU is. Again, the argument is not with Timmermans but the EU mainstream.This is also reflected in the battle over the 2021-27 EU budget and the demand from many that rule-of-law conditionality be incorporated into it. Member states who misspend or allow ersion of EU money will face clawbacks.It didn’t all go the way of the anti-Timmermans lobby, however. Charles Michel, the new European Council president, has been a strong advocate of burden-sharing on migration and is one of the architects of Belgian proposals for annual peer review of rule-of-law standards in the member states.There has been some surprise in Brussels that the V4 and Italy endorsed a top jobs list which does not include a single eastern European name. It seems that the victory being claimed by them was simply defined: the defeat of Timmermans."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTheresa May to snub Tory Party Conference to speak at literary festival insteadBoris Johnson unveils £1 billion plan to

Camilla Tominey and Natasha Bernal profiled the millennials behind the online activities of many of the party\u0027s MPs.Following the debate over whether or not Tory MP Rory Stewart had been an MI6 spy, a former intelligence analyst and operational officer discussed what life is like once you leave the world of espionage behind.With the issue of how borders are policed and controlled post-Brexit never far from the news, Tom Hoggins looked at the futuristic technology that could be used on Britain\u0027s borders.To listen,  simply click the \u0027play\u0027 button of the recording you wish to listen to.‘If you\u0027re looking for profit, this isn’t the business for you’: why music festivals are no moneyspinners Meet the millennials helping the Tory leadership hopefuls go viral The secrecy of being in MI6 is tough - but life gets harder once you leaveFrom drone swarms to AI border guards: How futuristic technology could be used to police Britain\u0027s borders Theresa May to snub Tory Party Conference to speak at literary festival insteadBoris Johnson unveils £1 billion plan to put bobbies back on the beatPrivate schools told to open up places and facilities to children in careGive free care to the elderly, next Prime Minister is urged Bring in laws to force companies to make recycling labels simpler, MPs toldAndy Burnham claims \u0026#39northerners face discrimination in London\u0026#39 as he criticises upper-classes PMsOne in ten patients in NHS hospitals is alcohol dependent, Kings College study findsInvestigation shows hospitals with sewage spillages, collapsed ceilings and babies left to freezeHuman rights lawyer jailed for abusing Air India cabin crew found dead at Beachy HeadComment: I am the only person who can save the country from Jeremy CorbynJeremy Hunt tells Tory members: Only I can see off \u0026#39clear and present danger\u0026#39 of CorbynArmy Major sacked and imprisoned after groping students at Burns Night danceComment: The EU is a sham democracy, and its pitiful new leaders are the proofBoris Johnson was paid £42,580 for speech on day he announced leadership bidJeremy Hunt to push to legalise foxhunting if he becomes PMElectoral Commission in row with Met police, after they are accused of failing to hand over documentsMan in his 40s dies after being stabbed in broad daylightComment: Only moving to a fully-federal system can save our Union from destructionEngland\u0026#39s longest serving bishop blocked lifetime ban for paedophile priest, government inquiry hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/03/TELEMMGLPICT000202663901_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GgL7o0_ESnuLxJzSWOePQE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"end french exchange red tape safeguarding culture blamed decline","story":"Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014It was once considered a rite of passage for secondary pupils. But the French exchange is becoming a thing of the past, according to a British Council report which found that red tape is partly to blame for its decline.Sending children on exchanges has “fallen out of fashion” in part due to the “safeguarding culture” and Government red tape, according to Vicky Gough, schools advisor to the British Council.Guidelines from the Department for Education state that English families that host foreign pupils should undergo Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks and for this reason many schools and local authorities are put off, she said.“Because the regulations say parents should be DBS-checked, this makes people think this is a risky undertaking,” Ms Gough told the . “Some schools and local authorities don’t allow any to take place for this reason. The whole culture of safeguarding has changed”.Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014, the British Council’s annual language trends survey found.The poll of 1,600 teachers showed that while a greater proportion of private schools organise exchanges, they have seen a steeper decline over the same time period.Just under half (48 per cent) of fee-paying schools currently offer the trips, down from 53 per cent last year and 77 per cent in 2014.“When I was at school everyone did an exchange, everyone’s older brothers and sisters had done one,” Ms Gough said.“If it’s something that has always happened, pupils have heard about it from others and seen their photos, they feel comfortable.  “But when it falls out fashion and falls out of the school’s culture, it then sounds a bit odd and risky.”Ms Gough said that exchanges may be declining faster in private schools than in their state counterparts due to the management being more “risk averse” and cautionary.At a glance | How to learn another languageShe said state schools are under more financial as well as time pressure, and may not see organising exchange trips as a priority.Ms Gough told how at in the mid 1990s, every secondary school in Durham did one or even two exchanges, but now there is only one secondary left that does it.The number of pupils taking French and German GCSEs and A-levels has plummeted in recent years.Entries for GCSEs in both subjects has dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent. A-level entries are also declining, but at more gradual rate.Earlier this year, the Government set up a £2.5 million fund for schools to spend on taking disadvantaged children on trips abroad, including foreign language exchange trips. Ministers hope that the move will boost the numbers of pupils taking modern foreign languages at GCSE.Do you have fond memories of foreign exchanges from schooldays gone by?

It is estimated that for every teacher’s death, nine children will die, meaning over 100 people will die every year in the UK as a result of exposure when they were at school. There is no statutory duty on schools to report their asbestos management, Ms Sweeney said, which means many turn a blind eye to the potential danger it poses.  “Primary schools contain children who are boisterous,” she told The Daily . “If you don’t know where the asbestos is, how can you ever ensure they aren’t disturbed?  “The simple act of putting a pin into a wall to put a display up can puncture the wall and that might release fibres – teachers at the very least should know where the asbestos is.”  A Government report published in 2017 found that asbestos in schools is a “serious” problem which could threaten the health of children, as it concluded that thousands of schools are failing to follow safety guidelines. Liz Darlison, from Mesothelioma UK, the national charity for asbestos-related cancer, said that because developing the disease can take several decades following exposure, the dangers of asbestos are “perhaps not fully appreciated”.  She said: “Many people still think that asbestos is a problem of the past and that asbestos-related illnesses only occur in trades’ people or people who have worked in the construction industry.“This is simply not the case. The potentially deadly material has been used in all types of buildings and is still present in many primary schools due to aging school buildings.”A Department for Education spokesman said it plans to publish the findings of its Asbestos Management Assurance Process school survey shortly.  “Since 2015, we have already allocated more than £7.4 billion to those responsible for school buildings to maintain and improve the school estate, including removing asbestos when it is the safest course of action, the spokesman added. Theresa May to snub Tory Party Conference to speak at literary festival insteadBoris Johnson unveils £1 billion plan to put bobbies back on the beatPrivate schools told to open up places and facilities to children in careOne in ten patients in NHS hospitals is alcohol dependent, Kings College study findsGive free care to the elderly, next Prime Minister is urged Bring in laws to force companies to make recycling labels simpler, MPs toldAndy Burnham claims \u0026#39northerners face discrimination in London\u0026#39 as he criticises upper-classes PMsInvestigation shows hospitals with sewage spillages, collapsed ceilings and babies left to freezeHuman rights lawyer jailed for abusing Air India cabin crew found dead at Beachy HeadComment: I am the only person who can save the country from Jeremy CorbynArmy Major sacked and imprisoned after groping students at Burns Night danceComment: The EU is a sham democracy, and its pitiful new leaders are the proofBoris Johnson was paid £42,580 for speech on day he announced leadership bidJeremy Hunt tells Tory members: Only I can see off \u0026#39clear and present danger\u0026#39 of CorbynJeremy Hunt to push to legalise foxhunting if he becomes PMElectoral Commission in row with Met police, after they are accused of failing to hand over documentsMan in his 40s dies after being stabbed in broad daylightComment: Only moving to a fully-federal system can save our Union from destructionEngland\u0026#39s longest serving bishop blocked lifetime ban for paedophile priest, government inquiry hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bring laws force companies make recycling labels simpler mps","story":"Consumers are confused about what they can and cannot recycle Retailers should be forced to introduce binary labeling to clearly inform consumers whether a product is recyclable or not, amid widespread confusion, two industry leaders had said.Stuart Lendrum, Head of Packaging at Iceland, told the Environment Food and Rural Affairs committee that the government must introduce laws to simplify the current system which uses dozens of symbols, most of which the public does not understand.Karen Graley, Packaging Manager at Waitrose, agreed that the government should legislate.“Absolutely, we\u0027d support that, moving to a binary label as soon as possible so we make it easier for consumers to understand what to do with the material and a piece of packaging,” she told MPs.The comments were made as part of the select committee\u0027s inquiry into \u0027Plastic food and drink packaging\u0027. The  recently launched a Zero Waste campaign calling on the government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s recycling rates and make the process simpler.The UK has no national strategy for recycling with local authorities accepting a variety of materials and processing them in different ways, which means some households are able to recycle specific items when others are not.The current recycling labeling is also confusing with a plethora of different labels which indicate whether a product can be recycled or not. The Keep Britain Tidy ‘tidyman’ logo, for example, which shows a man putting paper in a bin, is often mistaken for a ‘recyclable’ sign, when it is just encouraging people to pick up litter.Even the Keep Britain Tidy logo is confusing for consumers Conversely the symbol of a man putting a bottle in a bin surrounded by a triangle means that it is glass which should be recycled.Likewise, the recycling triangle logo containing a number inside seems to suggest a plastic is recyclable.  But numbers ‘3’ for PVC and ‘6’ for polystyrene are virtually never recycled by councils because it is too difficult. Mr Lendrum told MPs that there were too many different types of material being made, and too much confusion for consumers.“We need fewer materials, we\u0027ve got to simplify the material mix of what\u0027s being used, we\u0027ve got to simplify the labeling to support that and move to a binary \u0027it\u0027s recyclable or it\u0027s not\u0027 and make it mandatory so it\u0027s the same labeling on every single pack that\u0027s on sale in the UK,” he said.“We\u0027re not at the mandatory labeling system yet, we\u0027re not yet at the binary labeling system and we still have too many different materials.” There are dozens of recycling symbolsA separate survey by YouGov on behalf of Keep Britain Tidy and Brita UK, also found that just half of businesses are offering recycling services in the workplace, while four in 10 are doing nothing to reduce plastic waste, a new survey has found.The study of more than 1,000 small to medium sized firms (SMEs) found just a quarter believe they have a responsibility to help customers and staff reduce their use of single-use plastic. And fewer than one in five (18 per cent) have replaced single-use plastics with reusable alternatives. Nearly half (44 per cent) do not think their business has a responsibility to provide recycling facilities in the workplace and only one in three (29 per cent) think they are responsible for encouraging customers to recycle.There are 5.7 million small and medium-sized businesses in the UK, accounting for 99 per cent of all businesses.Allison Ogden-Newton, Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive, said: “This research makes for shocking reading but it is not simply about knocking businesses for inaction – it is about understanding the barriers they face and looking to work with them to offer the expertise, support and guidance that will help them transform for good.“Keep Britain Tidy is a charity that is focused on developing solutions and, through these solutions, helping businesses tackle the problems of waste, including single-use plastic.“The public are willing to get out there and do something to clean up the plastic that they see around them – more than half a million volunteers gave their time during the Great British Spring Clean to do just that – and businesses must support the public by playing their part.” Sarah Taylor, Managing Director of Brita UK, said: “The last few years have seen a sea change in our awareness of the impact of single-use plastic on the marine and wider environment.It’s been exciting to see so many household name businesses take big steps to reduce their single-use plastic footprint, from providing staff with reusable alternatives, such as reusable water bottles and coffee cups, to trialling refill schemes for customers in stores.Real change will only be achieved if the business community comes together to find solutions to the challenges posed by single-use plastic.”Theresa May to snub Tory Party

in orange, who are now 90 minutes away from becoming world as well as European championsClick to followSportSometimes, one moment of quality is all that is required. And as Jackie Groenen found out, it can even be enough to win a World Cup semi-final, particularly a semi-final as poor as this. Groenen and the Netherlands will contest Sunday’s final, after her fine strike beat Sweden to settle an otherwise unremarkable contest.This had none of the controversy, intensity or drama of Tuesday’s semi-final, played on the same pitch 24 hours earlier. The United States will not be troubled by anything they witnessed here. England’s players will have watched two teams short on quality with one persistent, nagging question: “What if?”But while Phil Neville and his players will be in Nice this weekend, attempting to rise themselves for a third-place play-off against this Swedish side, the Netherlands will be 90 minutes away from becoming world as well as European champions. For a team who qualified for the first World Cup four years ago, it is some achievement.Head coach Saerina Wiegman should thank her goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, who made several important saves when Sweden were marginally on top. Much of the credit must go to Groenen, who capitalised on the space the Swedes offered her, striking low into the far corner to seal the final berth.The first half was poor. Van Veenendaal, one of the Netherlands’ four-strong Arsenal contingent, was the most vocal member of their pre-match huddle and the busiest of their players in those opening 45 minutes. Sweden edged them - with two shots on target to one by their opponents - and the goalkeeper had to be alert for both attempts.Created with Sketch. Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in Stina Blackstenius’ form would usually convert the first. Sofia Jakobsson’s delicate work in midfield slipped Sweden’s match-winner from the quarter-final through one-on-one. Her shot was right down Van Veenendaal’s throat, even if she only collected the ball at the second time of asking.The Dutch ‘keeper’s handling was questionable at times, particularly on the flat and straight corners Sweden insisted on playing. One failure to come and collect allowed Elin Rubensson to shoot from the edge of the area, and when that attempt was blocked, Lina Hurtgi pounced on the rebound. Van Veenendaal beat the shot away with her feet.Her best save, however, came in the slightly-improved second half. Another awkward corner spread panic in the Netherlands’ penalty area, with space eventually opening up for Nila Fischer. The centre-half’s low drive was destined for the far, left-hand corner until Van Veenendaal’s fingertips erted it onto the post. It was an excellent save.At the other end of the pitch, the Netherlands were offering very little, especially for a team whose attacking talent lit up the 2017 European Championship and was much-vaunted at the start of this tournament. They too had to resort to the more prosaic form of set-piece play and it was not long before they had also hit the woodwork.Vivianne Miedema had been largely anonymous up until this point, but on one corner swung in from the right she managed to peel away from the Swedish defenders who had previously done so well to contain her. She crouched slightly, attempting to direct her header just underneath the crossbar. Instead, she struck it.Wiegman turned to her mercurial winger, Shanice van de Sanden, whose introduction was welcomed by those wearing orange in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, her club stadium. In the final minute of regulation time, Van de Sanden was presented with a chance to spare us all another 30 minutes. Hedvig Lindahl, Sweden’s goalkeeper, tipped a rising shot over.Sembrant and Vivianne Miedema tussle for possession (Getty)The Netherlands were now at least building attacks better, having largely nullified Sweden’s early threat. What the contest needed now was someone, anyone, to make a difference. As the clock crept into three figures, up stepped Groenen, reacting fastest to Danielle van de Donk’s deflected pass and from 20 yards out, drilling low and hard into the far corner.If that is the sum total of the Dutch’s end product on Sunday, the United States will almost certainly win a fourth Women’s World Cup, retaining their 2015 title.

And as Jackie Groenen found out, it can even be enough to win a World Cup semi-final, particularly a semi-final as poor as this. Groenen and the Netherlands will contest Sunday’s final, after her fine strike beat Sweden to settle an otherwise unremarkable contest.This had none of the controversy, intensity or drama of Tuesday’s semi-final, played on the same pitch 24 hours earlier. The United States will not be troubled by anything they witnessed here. England’s players will have watched two teams short on quality with one persistent, nagging question: “What if?”But while Phil Neville and his players will be in Nice this weekend, attempting to rise themselves for a third-place play-off against this Swedish side, the Netherlands will be 90 minutes away from becoming world as well as European champions. For a team who qualified for the first World Cup four years ago, it is some achievement.Head coach Saerina Wiegman should thank her goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, who made several important saves when Sweden were marginally on top. Much of the credit must go to Groenen, who capitalised on the space the Swedes offered her, striking low into the far corner to seal the final berth.The first half was poor. Van Veenendaal, one of the Netherlands’ four-strong Arsenal contingent, was the most vocal member of their pre-match huddle and the busiest of their players in those opening 45 minutes. Sweden edged them - with two shots on target to one by their opponents - and the goalkeeper had to be alert for both attempts.Created with Sketch. Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in Stina Blackstenius’ form would usually convert the first. Sofia Jakobsson’s delicate work in midfield slipped Sweden’s match-winner from the quarter-final through one-on-one. Her shot was right down Van Veenendaal’s throat, even if she only collected the ball at the second time of asking.The Dutch ‘keeper’s handling was questionable at times, particularly on the flat and straight corners Sweden insisted on playing. One failure to come and collect allowed Elin Rubensson to shoot from the edge of the area, and when that attempt was blocked, Lina Hurtgi pounced on the rebound. Van Veenendaal beat the shot away with her feet.Her best save, however, came in the slightly-improved second half. Another awkward corner spread panic in the Netherlands’ penalty area, with space eventually opening up for Nila Fischer. The centre-half’s low drive was destined for the far, left-hand corner until Van Veenendaal’s fingertips erted it onto the post. It was an excellent save.At the other end of the pitch, the Netherlands were offering very little, especially for a team whose attacking talent lit up the 2017 European Championship and was much-vaunted at the start of this tournament. They too had to resort to the more prosaic form of set-piece play and it was not long before they had also hit the woodwork.Vivianne Miedema had been largely anonymous up until this point, but on one corner swung in from the right she managed to peel away from the Swedish defenders who had previously done so well to contain her. She crouched slightly, attempting to direct her header just underneath the crossbar. Instead, she struck it.Wiegman turned to her mercurial winger, Shanice van de Sanden, whose introduction was welcomed by those wearing orange in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, her club stadium. In the final minute of regulation time, Van de Sanden was presented with a chance to spare us all another 30 minutes. Hedvig Lindahl, Sweden’s goalkeeper, tipped a rising shot over.Sembrant and Vivianne Miedema tussle for possession (Getty)The Netherlands were now at least building attacks better, having largely nullified Sweden’s early threat. What the contest needed now was someone, anyone, to make a difference. As the clock crept into three figures, up stepped Groenen, reacting fastest to Danielle van de Donk’s deflected pass and from 20 yards out, drilling low and hard into the far corner.If that is the sum total of the Dutch’s end product on Sunday, the United States will almost certainly win a fourth Women’s World Cup, retaining their 2015 title.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course. AndI had to pick only one, it would be Tommy claiming Molly-Mae “refreshies me,”you really ­pushied me.The inescapable feeling, watching this series of Love Island, however, is that all the innocence and quite a lot of the charm has been lost forever, like, literally.Joe and Lucie — Jucie.Jordan and Anna — Jordanna.Anton and Belle — Bellend.FOLLOWING the main BBC News, from Glastonbury, and The One Show, from Glastonbury, there was a complete change of gear from the Beeb from .pm on Friday.Glastonbury, on every single BBC channel, with the usual cast of thousands playing presenter tag.So a gushing Clara Amfo threw to Mark Radclfe and Jo Whiley, who threw to Jack Saunders, at the John Peel stage, who threw to James Ballardie, who threw back to Jo Whiley and some new bloke called Huw Stephens, who threw . . .You get the point. There were busloads of them.Yet, with the honourable exception of Mark Radclfe, who’s a great broadcaster, the usual rules of presenting were suspended at Glastonbury.None of them were presentable, for a start.Genuine laughs were non-existent and nearly all critical faculties had been left at home, so they couldn’t even point out “s children’s TV presenter” wasn’t a good look for Tim Burgess, of The Charlatans, let alone hint that maybe Stormzy hadn’t had enough big hits to headline the Pyramid Stage.You’d imagine, then, that they all brought a breadth of knowledge and inside information that would illuminate the valley like , cigarette lighters being flipped on for a final encore.Jo Whiley: “Do you have any idea who might be coming out on stage with Stormzy ”Huw Stephens: “I have no idea.”But you’d imagine wrong.MEANWHILE, on recent episodes of ­EastEnders, the emaciated remains of Louise Mitchell have been found inside a shipping ­container that washed up in the Crimea, Keanu’s died after being tied to a chair and shoved off a tall building by Sharon, and new love interest Adrian Edmonson reacted to being doused in water by battering Jean Slater ­repeatedly round the head with a ­rubber frying pan and jabbing a fork into her ­buttocks.Not in broadcast episodes, obviously. Just the make-believe version I’ve got playing in my own head.Glastonbury, Jo Whiley: “Stormzy seems like the nicest guy on Earth.”Love Island, Molly-Mae: “I’m not a stereotypical social media girl.”And Drag SOS: “The Family Fabulous are travelling the country to give Britain a much needed lt.”Or yet another little needed ar*e-ache, depending on your point of view.JUST when you thought television had run out of jobs, holidays, pointless endeavours and ar*e-end-of-the-world places for Z-listers to visit, along comes this next game of Monkey Tennis.Trawlermen: Celebs At Sea, with Shane Lynch, from Boyzone, chef Antony Worrall Thompson and former England rugby player Ben Cohen, who spent ten days bobbing around the North Atlantic and throwing their guts up for the benefit of Channel  viewers.Before they reached that happy pass, though, the three of them were warned, in no uncertain terms, that one unlucky trawlerman had recently “lost his testicles after getting them tangled”.Something which, you’d think, wouldn’t hold any new horror for Ben Cohen after having to tell his we Abby what he’d been up to with the Russian dancer from Strictly.Two days into their adventure, however, he was confronted by something just as terrying, which had his voice trailing off, down in the gutting room.“I remember this monkfish coming towards me with its mouth open and teeth everywhere.“And it was a big mouth as well and I just thought . . .”Kristina  What the hell are you doing here Picture research: Marta Breese.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Who’s the only one of the Queen’s children not to have a daughter ”Vivienne: “Prince Philip.”Bradley Walsh: “What nickname for golfer Frank Urban Zoeller is derived from his initials ”Richard: “Tiger.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which item of swimming gear is named from an atoll in the Pacic Ocean ”Andy: “Speedo.”And Bradley Walsh: “The Attenborosaurus dinosaur is named in honour of which TV naturalist ”Hannah: “Pass.”Casey Stoney: “Crucially it means Nigeria have only had  hours to prepare.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the answer must not be an affront to open justice which risks the guilty getting away with crimes.It is for police to be less credulous as they sort fantasists from victims, to charge or clear suspects far more ­rapidly and to punish all  accusers.Secrecy is not the solution.LABOUR’S limitless self-harm continues.Taxing children for parental gts is a sucker punch for young middle-class urban Remainers — rapidly becoming Labour’s core vote — who rely on mum and dad to help them buy or rent.And the working class face punishment too. The pensions of , ex-miners, British Coal and British Steel workers will be trashed by Labour’s cut-price nationalisation of the private utilities they’re invested in.Labour detests the rich.

I think it was all a stunt for the papers.Sarah was a nanny and looked after the children of wealthy couples. Often she would work odd hours and stay overnight caring for the children so Id take in parcels for her.Sarah has vowed she will never settle for having just one partner again — and has instead ed head first into the kinky world of sex fetish parties.She has now sworn off monogamy – after her marriage to the man she wed on their first date ended in under two months.Sarah, who is now dating TWO toyboys, matched with husband Paul Edwards on dating app Bumble in December .Ten days later they met for the first time at Gatwick Airport and flew to Las Vegas to get hitched over Christmas.But it’s not all doom and gloom for Sarah. She says: “My marriage may be over but it has opened me up to a whole new world.“I no longer believe monogamy and marriage is the be-all and end-all.“Now I’m living the polyamorous lestyle and loving it.“My rainbow hair is the embodiment of the new me — strong, confident and ready for whatever the weather.”The couple’s split did not come as a surprise to Sarah’s family and friends, who always thought she was “bonkers” for marrying someone she had never met before.And Sarah confessed it was not exactly lust at first sight.She says: “I wasn’t initially attracted to Paul. But he seemed laid-back and nice and I was swept away in the moment.”The pair celebrated their honeymoon by buying each other private lap dances at a strip club.Sarah, who loves being a dominatrix, thought she had finally met someone who could keep up with her high sex drive.“It was great,” she recalls. “I love kinky parties and role playing and although Paul was not au fait with that world, he was open to it.“I thought I’d met my match, in and out of the bedroom.”Once back in the UK, Paul, , who was training to be an electrician, moved from Chichester, West Sussex, into Sarah’s home in Crowborough, East Sussex, which she shared with her two exes — also called Paul.Sarah says: “At first all three Pauls got on well. We were one big, happy, albeit unusual, family.“But my husband was very jealous of one of my Pauls, who I’d had a long-term relationship with and who shared the mortgage.”A week after husband Paul moved in, Sarah claims he started a row with her and her two Pauls.She says: “Everyone was getting on well. We were playing a board game and chilling out together at home.“But Paul got funny because I was apparently sitting two inches closer to my ex on the sofa.“He accused me of still being in love with him.“After that night the atmosphere turned sour and both ex Pauls started to hide in their rooms. It should have been a huge red flag.”“I understood my Paul’s fears as it was a weird set-up.“I’d sometimes be with my ex in his room, comforting him, but leaving the door open to appease my husband.“But Paul would storm in and accuse me of sleeping with Paul.”In an attempt to get their relationship back on track, Sarah says, the couple got dressed up in kinky gear for a night out at sex fetish party Torture Garden.Unsurprisingly, it did not do the trick. Sarah says: “Paul was a fish out of water.“Guys were coming up to me just to say ‘Hi’ and he would get all jealous and put his arm around me asto say, ‘She’s mine’.“Shortly after, we went to a gay night at a club in Brighton.“I was chatting to a gay couple at the bar. They were being flirty, flamboyant and fabulous and pushed a lollipop in my face and said, ‘Do you want a suck babe ’.“Jokingly, I obliged then gave one a cheeky kiss on the lips. Paul went absolutely mental and said I’d cheated on him.“He followed me around the whole night and watched me like a hawk.“I felt conned, like he had sold me a version of himself that wasn’t real.“As I became less attracted to him, our sex le dwindled.“He also got a man cold and was moaning all the time. It wasn’t sexy at all.”In February, Sarah says she asked Paul to move out as the rows were getting her down.But determined to prove the doubters wrong, Sarah decided to try to give their relationship another go. She says: “I knew people would say, ‘I told you so’, which was hard to swallow.“We were married and I took those vows seriously. I still wanted to make it work.”Later that month, they met for a romantic dinner. A few days after, Sarah says Paul invited her to a swingers’ night at club Le Boudoir in central London.She continues: “We were having a good night and were both chatting to a couple.“Paul fancied the girl and the pair started kissing. It didn’t bother me as, you know, we were in a swinging club, and I kissed her too.“But then her boyfriend stuck his hand up my skirt and grabbed me and I thought, ‘This is not cool’.“So I left the circle and went to get a drink.“Paul was annoyed as I’d ruined his chances with the girl and started another big row.”After a failed attempt at couples’ counselling, the pair split for good — days before their two-month anniversary.And as Paul left Sarah’s flat for the final time, he took one of Sarah’s Pauls with him.“That really upset me,” recalls Sarah. “He got that Paul to move in somewhere . It wasn’t the ex he was really jealous of, it was my other ex, whom I dated for a while.“It was really tough. I’d lost one of my jobs as a nanny and now I was going to lose the £ a month rent from that Paul.”It was then that Sarah says she decided to REALLY throw herself into the kink and sex fetish community.She says: “I became obsessed. I started going to a dferent BDSM event every week.“I lost all my mates when I married Paul, so now all my new friends are at these events.”In May she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and matched with a -year-old toyboy who works in the City of London.“He told me he was polyamorous,” she says. “We got on so well and his unconventional lestyle made sense.“He sees other women and I have recently met another -year-old guy who works in IT. It’s amazing, we all go to kink events together.“I dress them up in whatever outfits I want and I am their dom.“I dressed one up as a ballet dancer the other day.“They don’t get jealous of each other and we always ask permission first before getting with someone .“After feeling trapped in a jealous marriage it has really put me off being with one man again.”Laughing, she adds: “I’d love three boyfriends. It’s a good number.“I’ve got another date next week and I am very excited about it.” She says: “Despite everything, I don’t regret my relationship with Paul because I have learnt so much about myself and I’m much stronger and confident now.“But I am never dating another Paul again . . . it’s a rubbish name anyway.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt.

He did what he did, and he was going to do what he did, no matter what.“If it hadn’t been Sarah it would have been somebody  that day, and in some ways, a family that can survive or has survived it.I think the ultimate message of the documentary is that we have survived.Sarah Payne: The Untold Story is on ITV on Thursday at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer arm torn off hay baling","story":"Brave Andy Webster, , was pulled into the giant machine as he tended to a field in Weston-Under-Wetherley, Warwickshire.A quick-thinking colleague saved his le by stopping the machinery before his head was dragged inside.Surgeons battled for hours to save the mangled limb, but it was amputated at University Hospital Coventry last week.An online fundraising appeal for Andy has already raked in over £,.Writing on the page, pal Angie Miles said: We are all thankful for is how incredibly lucky he is to have survived with his le.With stalwart character, keen toto work as soon as possible, never accepting defeat no matter what le throws at him, even under these unimaginable circumstances to have found inner strength to just get on with it as he always does is truly inspirational.Whilst he focuses on recovery and rehabilitation from what has become a full amputation of his right arm it it is hard to imagine how this will continue to impact on him emotionally and physically.However, we can all help practically in some way to alleviate pressure  worry of keeping his le together."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may speech first tory conference","story":"The outgoing PM, who steps down in three weeks time, has agreed to be interviewed at the Henley Literary Festival on Monday September  - Day Two of the Conservatives’ annual gathering in Manchester.It is tradition for former party leaders to take a vow of silence at least for the first few years after leaving power so as not to cause trouble for the new party boss.The action will be seen as Mrs May teeing up a chance to fire a warning shot over her successor’s bows.The Tory leader also reaffirmed her pledge to stay on as an MP yesterday to the Commons, angrily shooting down a Lib Dem claim she was about toresign her seat.Announcing her at the festival in Henley, which borders her Maidenhead constituency, its organisers said: “Mrs May is scheduled to appear on thSeptember, which is during the Tory party conference.“She can frequently be seen shopping in the town.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games.

Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed.

The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said it was part of the countryside’s “heritage” and should be legalised. Mr Huntaposs surprise intervention will trigger dismay among Tory modernisers, who hoped he was the candidate to quell Boris Johnsonaposs lurch to the right. Sources stressed he would only seek to bring a free vote to the Commons – where MPs vote according to their consciences –there was a majority in Westminster for such a view.  Mr Hunt told the : “I donapost hunt myself, itaposs not particularly my thing. “I think we have to recognise itaposs part of the countryside and I think we have to recognise that, in terms of the balance of the countryside, itaposs part of our heritage. “So personally Iaposm happy for people to do it.

In reality, such a situation is highly unlikely, with the overwhelming majority of MPs fiercely opposed to a reintroduction of the bloodsport.  However, Mr Huntaposs vocal display of support for hounds ripping apart foxes risks derailing his No bid. Theresa Mayaposs confession to the Mirror during the snap  general election that she had always backed the rural past-time was widely blamed for fuelling her ballot box humiliation. She said then: As it happens, personally I have always been in favour of fox hunting and we maintain our commitment - we have had a commitment previously as a Conservative Party - to allow a free vote. And thataposs what it will allow, would allow, Parliament the opportunity to take a decision on this. Polls consistently show around three-quarters or more of Britons are against bringing back the bloodsport.    Traditional hunts now follow a scent trail instead of a fox, or work around loopholes in the law. Countryside campaigners repeatedly demand a shake-up, effectively repealing the  Hunting Act.Mrs May’s predecessor David Cameron also promised Parliament a vote on repeal but had to scrap it after the SNP vowed to block it, even though it does not apply to Scotland.Chris Luffingham, League Against Cruel Sports director of campaigns, hit back at Mr Huntaposs comments and suggested they could be damaging to his chances in a general election.“The last time a politician said we should bring back hunting - Theresa May in the  General Election – they were punished in the polling booths, he said.“Nothing has changed. “The vast majority of the British public will be horried by any attempt to revert back to the barbaric activity of fox hunting.    “The Hunting Act needs to be strengthened, not repealed, as the hunts are currently still getting away with chasing and killing British wildle.“Hunting needs to be consigned to the history books, and this decision shows quite how out of touch with public opinion Jeremy Hunt is.“Fox hunting is a brutal nasty activity in which the hounds literally tear apart the foxes – this should have no place in a modern compassionate society.” Labour Party Chairman Ian Lavery added: This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse.“We’ve had Johnson’s tax cuts for the wealthy, a race to the bottom on no-deal Brexit , and now a pledge to bring back this barbaric practice that Labour had proudly banned."},{"url":null,"title":"mp accuses dwp incompetence cover","story":"NewsMP accuses DWP of incompetence or cover-up over benefit claimants deathsDebbie Abrahams blasted missing documents in a row over people who died after being subject to a fit-for-work testShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsDebbie Abrahams attacked the Department for Work and Pensions\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Labour MP has accused the government of incompetence or cover-up over the way it handled benefit claimantsapos deaths.

The DWP finally replied this week - but said it was too late to know for sure and documents may have been destroyed.    In a letter to the campaigning MP, DWP minister Justin Tomlinson said the government shared all relevant information which was requested by the review team. But he said it was up to the reviewers, not the DWP, to decide what documents they wanted to request. He added: The [DWP] would therefore not routinely share private information on claimant cases. Ms Abrahams blasted the reply, telling MPs: Weaposre talking about the circumstances of peopleaposs deaths about five years ago. To tell me these documents canapost be found smacks at least of incompetence and at worst of a cover-up.

She also demanded an in dependent inquiry into all deaths linked to the governmentaposs social security reforms. Deputy Commons Speaker Eleanor Laing said it was an extremely important matter - one literally of le and death.  In his letter, Mr Tomlinson confirmed the DWP has carried out  internal process reviews into inidual benefit cases since . Circumstances that can trigger a probe include investigating whether there was any link to the DWP in a benefit claimantaposs death. But the Tory minister claimed it would not be right to publish them because they contain personal information. He added not all relate to fit-for-work tests, which have been undergone by millions of people claiming sickness and disability benefit Employment and Support Allowance. Mr Tomlinson said DWP officials had run a robust and thorough search to checkdocuments were shared with Dr Litchfield.  But he said: Due to theof time since the reviews were carried out, factors such as document retention policies, organisational changes and staff turnover mean that information that might help answer these queries is no longer available. Therefore, as the information is no longer held by the department, we are unable to comment on this issue any further. He added: The [DWP] does not hold or collect data on the reason for death for benefit claimants. Whilst any death is extremely distressing for the family, no causal link can be made between the likelihood of dying and the fact that someone is claiming benefits.

Grandmother-of-three and great gran-of-two Mary Emerson has been making them most of her le. But the -year-old says as she has grown older she does nip into bakery chain Greggs to get her fix. She said: “I’ve enjoyed baking for as long as I can remember and everyone has always enjoyed my sausage rolls. “I still enjoy making them, with a little help. One of my favourite times to make them is Christmas with my granddaughter, Naomi.” She said the key to a perfect sausage roll is good quality sausage meat and cutting them up small.    Mary said: “Although my eyesight is poor and I have the odd niggle, I still try to make sausage rolls as they go down so well. “That and staying positive has been the secret to a long le.” Mary was thrown a surprise birthday by her local Greggs bakers for her birthday on Sunday.

David Baker and Carol McCann, both , were spotted inside a grey coloured car parked up at Northern Cricket club in Great Crosby on a spring afternoon. Despite insisting they were actually just clearing up some spilt coke, they were later charged with outraging public decency by having sex in view of the public. Baker, from Southport, and McCann, from Crosby, both pleaded guilty during a hearing at Sefton Magistrates today, reports the Liverpool Echo.They instead described a series of unfortunate events, involving a can of coke, which led to them being found in the position. Prosecutor Sarah Egan told the court how the mum and daughter noticed Baker aposnaked, and facing the rear of the car.apos    Baker was moving aposback and forwardapos and there was a woman below him. The mumaposs -year-old daughter said to her: Mum, are they doing what I think they are doing  The mum then approached the car with a second adult, which was in the overflow car park at Northern Cricket club. As they approached the car one of the women said to Baker and McCann: What do you think you are doing  Ms Egan said: At this point Mr Baker pulled up his trousers. Ms McCann made no effort to put her clothes on. The two women took a photograph of the couple in the car. The incident happened at around .pm on April  this year. Ms McCann, a dinner lady from Crosby, told the police that Baker had spilt a can of coke over her and that  she had been trying to change her clothes.    She told police that although she was topless she had her knickers on. The court heard that the couple had known each other in their youth but bumped into each other at Goodison Park. On the day of the incident McCann had picked up Baker, who was married, at Blundellsands station. They were planning on driving to Formby. Nick Archer, who defended Baker, said that although his client admitted the offence he did not have sex with McCann in the car. He explained how when Baker opened a can of coke in the car it went all over McCann. Baker had spare clothes and decided to use the overflow car park at Northern Cricket club to get changed.    But when she started to get changed aposone thing led to another.apos Mr Archer said that although the witnesses thought the couple were having sex this was not the case. He said: It may have looked like it, but it was not actual sex. Mr Bakeraposs coke had gone everywhere in the car. She knew there was an overflow carpark at the cricket club.  It was a safe place for her to get changed.  But due to an event on that day, people decided to use the carpark. It was a number of coincidences. One thing led to another, but it was short of intercourse.  Obviously my client is full of shame and embarrassment He has had to explain it to his family. Joe Woodyett, defending McCann, said that she did not have sex with Baker on the day of the incident - but that she was ashamed and sorry for what happened. Sefton Magistrates ordered Baker and McCann to do  hours unpaid work each. They were each ordered to pay £ in costs and a victim surcharge of £.

The move switches the holiday to May  in order to celebrate the th anniversary of VE Day, marking the end of war in Europe. But angry Morris dancers from across Britain plan to march on Parliament this month to demand ministers declare a second holiday instead. They say the switch will disrupt hundreds of festivals and events nationwide, causing local economies “major damage”. The decision to move the holiday from the first Monday of May was only revealed a month ago – giving event organisers and even calendar makers just  months’ notice.  Gordon Newton, founder of the Sweeps Festival in Rochester, Kent, said: “I’m hoping business secretary Greg Clarke will realise what a stupid mistake this is. “The Sweeps Festival contributes up to £million to the local economy.

The adult male was rescued at Horsey beach in Norfolk and nursed back to health. He was named Sir David, after Sir David Attenborough, whose Blue Planet II series raised awareness of damaging plastic pollution. Alison Charles, manager of the RSPCA centre at East Winch, said they were delighted at how well the “deep, extensive, wound” to his neck had healed. The toys caused most cases along with fishing paraphernalia, according to The Friends of Horsey Seals, which monitors colonies in Norfolk. There had been multiple sightings of the seal with the frisbee around his neck but he could not be caught until he weakened.    Volunteers from Friends of Horsey Seals and Marine and Wildle Rescue used a net to catch him. Alison Charles, manager of the RSPCA centre, said Sir David was in a right state when he was brought in, adding that the frisbee caused a huge, deep, extensive wound to his neck that became infected. She said she was really pleased at how well his wounds healed and thanked all those who helped, including the public who helped fund his recovery. Sir David required regular salt baths as part of his rehabilitation, with the public donating more than £, towards the cost of salt, medication and fish. The frisbee was cut off by a vet using surgical scissors and Sir David was given antibiotics and painkillers.  Ms Charles said when Sir Davidaposs wound was clean they moved him to an outdoor pool to build his strength and fitness. It was all about good nutrition and time, she said. We built up his strength by throwing his fish one at a time at each end of his pool, so that he had to exercise and stretch his neck to keep his healing scar tissue from becoming restricted. In order for him to feed in the wild he needs to be able to extend his neck. Sir David was the third seal found with a frisbee stuck around its neck on the coast of East Anglia in the last two years. Mrs Frisbee was rescued in  and released the following year, and a second, called Pinkafo, was rescued last December and released in May.    Sir Davidaposs road to recovery has actually been faster than the previous two frisbee seals we have cared for, but this has been because his injury was not as deep and infected as theirs, said Ms Charles. But he was weaker and more emaciated than they had been, and so we faced new challenges with getting him back to full strength. Itaposs been just wonderful to watch himback to the sea today. No matter how many seals we release, every one is just as special. There is nothing better than watching a rehabilitated animalback to the wild where they belong.To donate towards the cost of Sir Davidaposs recovery, and of other seals at the centre, see justgiving campaign eastwinchseals"},{"url":null,"title":"self confessed monster battered ex","story":"NewsSelf-confessed monster battered ex with hammer and kidnapped dogDean Coleman, , from Gateshead, Newcastle, was already serving a suspended sentence for assaulting Holly Parker when he launched an even more savage attack that left her thinking she was about to dieShareCommentsByRob KennedyCourt ReporterAbigail OLeary:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsDean Coleman, , was already serving a suspended sentence for assaulting Holly Parker \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA self-confessed aposmonsterapos battered his ex with a hammer and kidnapped her dog which he threatened to killshe reported his abusive behaviour. Dean Coleman, , was already serving a suspended sentence for assaulting Holly Parker. But, having agreed to give her a le to pick up a parcel, he left her terried by driving erratically and threatening to smash into a tree. The thug later turned up at her home and circled it for an hour. Then, as she waited for police to arrive, he attacked her with a hammer aiming blows at her head which she managed to block with her hand which was broken in the attack.A court heard Coleman snatched Miss Parkeraposs beloved dog, spray-painted vile abuse on and around her home and caused hundreds of pounds of damage, reports Chronicle Live .Coleman, from Swalwell in Gateshead, Newcastle, was branded a danger and locked up for four years with an extended licence period of a year. Miss Parker said she feared she would die while a judge said he had shown insight by saying he behaved like a monster.    Newcastle Crown Court heard the pair were in a four month relationship in  but Coleman had assaulted her and caused criminal damage, leading to him receiving a suspended prison sentence and a restraining order last year. Having ceased contact, Miss Parker got back in touch with him for a time but then stopped again due to his behaviour. However, on December  last year she needed to collect a parcel and, as she doesnapost drive, he agreed to take her to pick it up. But on the way back to her home in Whickham, she said his demeanour changed and he started driving erratically and at high speed, almost hitting a pedestrian. Nick Lane, prosecuting, said: She thought the driving was intended to scare her as she had recently lost her friend in a car accident. He began to question why she had not been in contact with him properly and he became very angry. He threatened to drive at high speed into a tree and she began to cry, shouting that she didnapost want to die. Coleman drove around for at least  minutes before she seized an opportunity on Coatsworth Road, Gateshead, to jump out of his van when it came to a stop. She ran through back lanes for five to  minutes to try to get away, stopping to hide behind a wall when she spotted him. Miss Parker rang a taxi to collect her to take her home and she got there about pm - but within five minutes she saw Coleman drive past in his van before ing and parking outside. He went round the back of her house, which he circled for around an hour, leaving her afraid when she heard smashing noises. When she saw him break some glass in a window next to the front door, she called .    The court heard she told him the police were on their way, to which he responded: If thataposs the case I might as well come and get you. Mr Lane said: Within moments she could see him moving across the street towards her. He grabbed her by the hair, kneed her in the face, pushed her to the ground and he hit and kicked her to the body while she was on the ground. She got up and he pushed her into ceramic bird bath in the garden, causing her to fall on her side. Miss Parker ran towards her neighbours home, shouting for help and banging on the door. Mr Lane said: While she was trying to get help, the defendant ran towards her with a hammer in his hand and was waving it above his head. She lted her arm to protect herself and he hit her seven times with the hammer. She describes each blow connecting with full force on one or both of her arms. He shouted at her to get in his van and she screamed at him to stop. She said the blows were aimed at her head but hit her hands as she was using them to protect herself. She describes being petried and fearing he was going to kill her. Eventually, a neighbour opened his door and she ran inside to safety and rang the police again. Officers turned up at .pm and found the front door had been damaged and the word s**g had been repeatedly spray-painted on the pavement and brick work of her house. Miss Parker also noticed her pet dog was missing. She asked her mum to text Coleman askinghe knew where the dog was and he replied suggesting he had the dog and would kill itthe police were contacted. He had also gone back in and smashed two televisions, the court heard.    Miss Parker was taken to hospital and was found to have a broken left hand, bruising and swelling to both arms and cuts and bruises to her her leg. Her Fitbit watch was also damaged. The total cost of the damage done to the house was £, the court heard. When Coleman was arrested, the dog was found in his possession. In interview, he gave some bizarre answers, initially admitting the attack, then saying he had chopped off her head with a machete and pulled her brains out, then claiming he had been in Benidorm at the time and said the victim was horrible and called her a compulsive liar. Miss Parker said in a victim impact statement: I thought he was going to kill me, I thought I was going to die. Iaposve never seen him like that, he really scared me, like something took over him. She said she felt ashamed for giving him another chance after the first assault, adding: I feel humiliated by the attack and I feel embarrassed that after a previous assault I was stupid enough to think he had changed and to even think about giving him another chance. I believed him when he said he loved me and promised to be dferent. She continued: He was hitting me with a hammer when he was really angry so I feel itaposs only luck my arms took all of the force as I desperately tried to protect my head. If any of the blows hit my head, I might not have survived. Roofer Coleman, who has seven previous convictions, pleaded guilty to GBH, burglary, possessing an offensive weapon, breaching a restraining order, two counts of criminal damage and breaching the suspended sentence. Judge Robert Spragg jailed him for four years with an extended licence period of a further year as part of an extended sentence after branding him dangerous. He was also given an indefinite restraining order. Referring to a pre-sentence report, the judge told Coleman: You have shown some insight, referring to yourself as a monster for what you have done. Paul Caulfield, defending, said: His instructions are at that particular time he was in a very dark place mentally and emotionally. He expresses through me his remorse for his conduct. He bitterly regrets what he did. Mr Caulfield said Coleman had glowing testimonials from prison.

Gerard told the inquest in Fulham, West London: “I blame myself for not being able to save my grandson.”    But Assistant Coroner Dr Sean Cummings said it “wasn’t salvageable”, adding it was a “freak accident”. Dr Cummings recorded a verdict of accidental death. From  all adults in England will be classed as having agreed to be organ donors unless they opt out.

Margarita Grachyova, , was forced into a car by partner -year-old Dimitry Grachyov and driven to a forest where he forced her to kneel before the horric attack. The psychologist carried out the vicious act in December  after becoming convinced she was having an affair. Now he is serving a -year jail sentence and she is determined to look sexy again after posing for glamour pictures in her native Russia. Margarita - or Rita - has won admirers around the world for the “inspirational” way she has rebuilt her le after the brutal attack. One hand was sewn back on - giving her limited use. The other was too badly damaged and she had an articial limb attached leading her young sons to call her “transformer mum”.    Posting her new pictures, she asked her social media followers: aposSexuality - how does it manest itself  “Right after the tragedy of  December , it seemed to me, and I sometimes still think so now, that I am no longer attractive. “Before I was a girl without any defects. “But I turned into a girl with no hand - and lots of scars on my left arm and leg. “To be honest, I have not learned to accept myself as I am. “Sometimes I am very upset and annoyed that my left hand looks chubby and blue from scars. “And the black prosthesis - it doesnapost really match a blue dress…. aposAnd when I wear a short skirt, four huge scars are visible on my leg. aposBut sexuality is not only the look, theof legs, and hair. “It is something deeper, something inside.”   She won thousands of likes for her postings on Instagram and Russian social media VK.Her profile reads: “Transformer-mum, two sons and a cat.

She won a string of admitting comments for her pictures. “You are so pretty, I sincerely admire you,” said one. Another posted: “Well done, Rita! Great happiness in le!” Her husband was jailed after a court case in Serpukhov, near Moscow, in which she cross-examined him. “No verdict willmy hands,” she said after the November case. And no [jail] term will. “I will have to live with it for the rest of my le.”    He showed “no remorse”, said Margarita, who denied she was unfaithful to her husband. Margarita’s left hand was sewn back on by surgeons, and she now has a “robot” right arm which she is learning to use as she rebuilds her le and cares for the couple’s two sons. Grachyov was found guilty by judge Irina Pantela of threatening his we with murder, kidnap, and causing her serious physical harm. Earlier he was stripped of his rights to raise the couple’s children. He told the court gruesome details of how he severed her hands after dragging her out of his car. “I wrapped ropes around her arms, next to her shoulders, in two places,” he said. He forced her to kneel and admitted his terror-stricken we was “screaming” and begging him not to dismember her. “As I was chopping her hands she didn’t try to run away. “She just fell down. “I dragged her to the car.

I was dreaming that I would faint. “I kept thinking all the time, why am I not fainting  “When he raised his axe, I just closed my eyes, I didn’t look at it….

While it is a loan for Greg, it is a loan that we are in charge of.“We can decide at the end of the seasonwe want to pay the small fee to NAC Breda.”Leigh was one of five summer signings handed Dons debuts against Connah’s Quay Nomads with Curtis Main, Jon Gallagher, Ryan Hedges and Ash Taylor also featuring.It was the second Dons debut for centre-back Taylor, who rejected a new contract at Pittodrie in  before signing for Northampton Town.Summer signing Craig Bryson was ruled out of the friendly in Cork with an ankle ligament injury sustained in April with Derby County.That ruled Bryson out of the Rams’ run to the Championship play-off final at Wembley where they lost to Aston Villa.Bryson will miss tonight’s friendly against the Blue Toon at Balmoor but could feature in Saturday’s game with Inverness Caley Thistle at Elgin.Left-back Leigh started against the Welsh side in Cork and delivered an impressive performance where he was strong in the air and defensively solid.McInnes is confident Leigh will also be an attacking threat this season and has challenged him to push on to effectively double up as a winger.He said: “Greg is going to be a good player for us.“I feel he has more to offer in an attacking sense and we will see that when a game opens up a little bit.“He has great legs, good confidence in the final third and he will show that this season.“We are delighted to get him. Greg will offer us more of an attacking threat than he showed.”Leigh emerged through the youth ranks at Manchester City and played four times for the first team in friendlies in  under Manuel Pellegrini. After more than a decade at the Premier League champions he left to sign for Bradford City.After a season at Bradford he was offered a new contract but opted to move to Bury where he spent two seasons.Leigh was on McInnes’ radar last summer but he opted to sign a three year contract with NAC Breda, making more than  appearances in the Dutch top flight.McInnes resurrected his interest in the full-back in January when Lowe ed to Derby after a half season loan.When Lowe ed to Derby any hopes of another loan at Aberdeen seemed dashed as he played twice for the Rams first team during the winter window.However, when former England international Ashley Cole was signed as left-back cover, the door opened for Lowe’sto the Granite City.“Greg is someone who we have monitored for a while,” said McInnes.“It is good to have a full-back of Greg’s type in the squad. What you want from your full backs is to be the best defender one on one and he has good tenacity and we will try to improve him on that as well.“We also want him to be like a winger in the opposition half and he has that. It is getting the balance right.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/5d1645037bf440.05507856.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet ziva mickey and lennon are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This sweet girl is a three-year-old old Balkan hound who will need a quiet home where she can blossom and grow in confidence.She is a shy girl and takes her time to get to know new people.

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"dementia week recognised in lochgilphead","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAlzheimer Scotland is holding some informative activities in Lochgilphead to help spread awareness and aid on dementia for Dementia Awareness Week.Representatives from Alzheimer Scotland will be in Lochgilphead Library offering advice on dementia on Wednesday June  from pm to pm and Friday June  from am to pm.Dementia Awareness Week takes place from Monday June  to Sunday June  and will this year focus on dementia research and support.Alzheimer Scotland#s messages for this year#s awareness campaign are:dementia research is crucial to making a dference for people living with dementia now, and in the futuredementia research can only take place with the help of volunteers who have dementia and those who do notto make sure that we can learn more about dementia prevention and improving quality of le, in our journey to ultimately finding a cureit is vital that people living with dementia feel recognised, valued and supported in their local communities to prevent isolation and stigmaand that Alzheimer Scotland provides a wide range of dementia-specic support, delivered through our localities in the heart of communities across Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray senior citizens gain culture at kelvingrove","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens Club had its annual bus outing this month.This year members travelled to the much-loved Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow on Wednesday May .The first stop was to The Loch Lomond Arms Hotel in Luss for a morning coffee stop, then on to Kelvingrove in time for the pm organ recital and a look round the exhibits.The trip was rounded off with a stop at the Stables Restaurant in Balloch for high tea and thenhome."},{"url":null,"title":"the easy club is taking the show on the road","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Easy Club is taking to the streets of Mid Argyll this summer to spread its musical message of ersity and inclusion –  although they will have a Plan B in place should the weather disagree.Club members will play by the Baptist Church, Lochgilphead, from pm to pm on Saturday June , then Ardrishaig by the Kelpies in Pier Square, from pm to pm on Saturday July .The club will also hit the Stag Hotel in Lochgilphead, either just before or just after early one evening.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the

a controversial planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal.

A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-affordable-homes-at-letham-mains-haddington-under-way","story":"In total,  new council houses and a further  housing association homes are being built at the Letham Mains site, off the B near Oaktree Junction.The site has a number of dferent developers currently at ious stages of construction as more than  new homes are planed alongside a new primary school on the land.East Lothian Council said that the work on the affordable housing, which was recently awarded to Hart Builders with a total cost of pound.million, was now under way.The homes are expected to be completed in phases between spring and autumn next year, with three more affordable developments expected to start on the Letham Mains site in future years.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, the councilrsquos cabinet spokesperson for housing, said: ldquoThis is great news for current and future residents of East Lothian.ldquoThere is a clear need for new affordable housing developments and these sites at Letham Mains will help contribute to meeting our local housing strategy outcomes by increasing the supply of affordable housing and improving access across dferent tenures and house types.The new Castle Rock Edin will take ownership of the  housing association homes being built on the site.Richard Jennings, the associationrsquos managing director, said: ldquoThere is strong demand for mid-market rent accommodation in East Lothian and we are delighted to deliver an affordable choice of high-quality, well-managed homes for people wishing to be part of the vibrant new community at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

Dont politicians always over-promise, throw money at the voters, spend astheres no tomorrow  Well, no actually they donrsquot ndash especially not Conservatives. You dont have to go back to the fiscally dry-as-dust Thatcher era to hear the mantra: ldquoonly spend what we can afford. The former Labour Chancellor, Gordon Brown, worshipped a god called ldquoprudence in the s, believing that Labour had lost successive elections because it couldnt be trusted with the purse strings of government.In  the Tories formed a government with the Liberal Democrats, which pledged to restore the nations finances by the most radical cost-cutting. It was called ldquoausterity\". George Osbornes programme was compared to the ldquoGeddes Axe ndash the eye-watering spending cuts imposed by the coalition Chancellor, Sir Eric Geddes, in .:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyIts worth reminding Jo Swinson, as she bids to be the next LibDem leader, that the Liberal Democrats endorsed Osbornes austerity. Indeed, Vince Cable, still says that austerity was ldquonecessary\".No one  seems to be saying that. There has been a seismic sht in the politics of public finance as politicians have suddenly abandoned the old language of fiscal rectitude. And not just in Britain. President Macron of France has had to reverse his public finance reforms. Donald Trump, despite all his rhetoric, has just put forward a record . trillion budget.What seems to have happened is that politicians of left and right, but most strikingly of the right, have become influenced by the rise of the populists. Populism is often wrongly regarded as a traditional conservative ideology boosted by anti-immigration nativism. This is a mistake. Asand YouGovs six-month study of the phenomenon pointed out, populists are much more left than conventional right, and generally seek to reduce inequality.ldquoThis is not something we expected to see, said Kirk Hawkins of . ldquoPopulism, in the end, is attractive because it takes seriously the grievances of people who feel abandoned and unfairly treated. In the crucible of Brexit, the traditional party of the right has realised that it must do something to address these grievances, or cease to exist as a political force.Im not suggesting that populists are the New Left. Only a fool would believe the promises being made on public spending. Donald Trumps spending splurge has largely been on defence and building a border wall. But the change in the ideological agenda is too striking to ignore.Jeremy Corbyns  Labour Manesto emerges, in retrospect, as relatively modest in its spending proposals. The SNP under Nicola Sturgeon is also beginning to look a little, er, conservative in its approach to public finances.As the former SNP MP George Kerevan pointed out, the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission report, with its plans to hold spending to % below GDP, has many similarities with the austerity programme of George Osborne after . At the very least, the SGC represents a covenant with the Scottish electorate that an independent Scottish Government would only spend within its means and would not indulge in radical deficit financing.Tell that to the Tories! Theyve discovered the magic money tree. They seem to be adopting the left wing economics of Modern Monetary Theory, which says that public spending deficits dont matter because governments can always print money.Of course, this is all in the context of Brexit. We are in an age of febrile politics. There will be a reckoning.

Dont politicians always over-promise, throw money at the voters, spend astheres no tomorrow  Well, no actually they donrsquot ndash especially not Conservatives. You dont have to go back to the fiscally dry-as-dust Thatcher era to hear the mantra: ldquoonly spend what we can afford. The former Labour Chancellor, Gordon Brown, worshipped a god called ldquoprudence in the s, believing that Labour had lost successive elections because it couldnt be trusted with the purse strings of government.In  the Tories formed a government with the Liberal Democrats, which pledged to restore the nations finances by the most radical cost-cutting. It was called ldquoausterity\". George Osbornes programme was compared to the ldquoGeddes Axe ndash the eye-watering spending cuts imposed by the coalition Chancellor, Sir Eric Geddes, in .:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyIts worth reminding Jo Swinson, as she bids to be the next LibDem leader, that the Liberal Democrats endorsed Osbornes austerity. Indeed, Vince Cable, still says that austerity was ldquonecessary\".No one  seems to be saying that. There has been a seismic sht in the politics of public finance as politicians have suddenly abandoned the old language of fiscal rectitude. And not just in Britain. President Macron of France has had to reverse his public finance reforms. Donald Trump, despite all his rhetoric, has just put forward a record . trillion budget.What seems to have happened is that politicians of left and right, but most strikingly of the right, have become influenced by the rise of the populists. Populism is often wrongly regarded as a traditional conservative ideology boosted by anti-immigration nativism. This is a mistake. Asand YouGovs six-month study of the phenomenon pointed out, populists are much more left than conventional right, and generally seek to reduce inequality.ldquoThis is not something we expected to see, said Kirk Hawkins of . ldquoPopulism, in the end, is attractive because it takes seriously the grievances of people who feel abandoned and unfairly treated. In the crucible of Brexit, the traditional party of the right has realised that it must do something to address these grievances, or cease to exist as a political force.Im not suggesting that populists are the New Left. Only a fool would believe the promises being made on public spending. Donald Trumps spending splurge has largely been on defence and building a border wall. But the change in the ideological agenda is too striking to ignore.Jeremy Corbyns  Labour Manesto emerges, in retrospect, as relatively modest in its spending proposals. The SNP under Nicola Sturgeon is also beginning to look a little, er, conservative in its approach to public finances.As the former SNP MP George Kerevan pointed out, the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission report, with its plans to hold spending to % below GDP, has many similarities with the austerity programme of George Osborne after . At the very least, the SGC represents a covenant with the Scottish electorate that an independent Scottish Government would only spend within its means and would not indulge in radical deficit financing.Tell that to the Tories! Theyve discovered the magic money tree. They seem to be adopting the left wing economics of Modern Monetary Theory, which says that public spending deficits dont matter because governments can always print money.Of course, this is all in the context of Brexit. We are in an age of febrile politics. There will be a reckoning.

His take is that Spaniards are moving on to his patch.He said: ldquoWersquove been fishing here for the last  years, but this year there was a line of three boats with enough nets to cover the whole area.ldquoAll in all there were  German-flagged Spanish boats with no track record of fishing here, taking up, I reckon,  square miles.ldquoIn years gone by they may have been here, but there were fewer of them and they were much further out, much deeper.

Dedication and accessibility   is the least voters now expect. No wonder so many images of MPs shows them in running gear, pounding the pavements and turning strawberry pink. This is not just a metaphor but a practical necessitythey are to survive the punishing regime their role demands.Despite much talk about our fast-ageing population, there has never been a period that is so youth-driven, or when the old have been so easily and cruelly dismissed as irrelevant or past-it because they have one foot still in a pre-tech world. The gulf between those born while ration books were circulating, and those whorsquod mastered an iPhone before their milk teeth were cut, is eye-wateringly wide. What does someone of pensionable age understand of the Snapchat generation  Other than the most basic human needs, such as security, work, and dignity, which transcend any barriers of time and class, colour and creed, what can an elderly politician offer a youthful electorate Well, perhaps more than yoursquod think. Clearly, what wersquore witnessing with the ongoing popularity of those like Mr Saunders and Donald Trump, is the triumph of longevity and experience over vigour. Their retro appeal is in part thanks to a letimersquos accumulation of high-powered connections and skills. Why be surprised that some dream even now of Ken Clarke taking over the Tory Party to bring it to its senses, despite him being almost as ancient as the Fortingall yew  Or that others rejoice at the distant prospect of Ann Widdecombe resurrecting her political career and ing as a Brexit Party MP.Experience, and the informed perspective it allows, is by far the greatest advantage of seniority. Is this what the young see when they look at people like Mr Corbyn, who lavishes more care on his allotment than on clear-cut policy yet commands widespread respect and even affection or why the venerable-looking Mr Saunders made such an impression with his brand of democractic socialism that he threatened to make Hillary Clinton toast It would seem so. Evidence suggests, indeed, that despite living in a world designed for youth, where to be in any way incapacitated or slow is to be invisible and ignored, we are nevertheless hard-wired as humans to defer to age. Rightly or wrongly, our instincts tell us that with wrinkles or bald pate, dentures or dodgy knees, comes hard-won wisdom. You might even argue that, far from being a handicap to reaching power, advanced age is actually an asset."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-laboured-in-his-hearing","story":"OUR story of the girl telling the astrophysicist that she was a Gemini reminded Archibald Crichton: \"I was in Northern Ireland at a party once and was introduced to a young lady from New Zealand who told me she was a Libra.

You might remember what happened: the house went up for sale in  and it looked like the estate would be broken up. The Chippendale furniture would be sold and the house emptied, and weather, vandals and entropy would be left to do the rest.:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyHowever, thatrsquos not what happened, thank God: the consortium led by the prince was successful in buying the house and, in the years since, it has spent many millions in renovating the buildings and the estate. But itrsquos the effects in the wider community that are particularly striking ndash effects Irsquove seen for myself as someone who lives nearby.Our local swimming pool was on the point of being closed for example. The Princersquos foundation renovated it and saved it. The same with our once decrepit town hall. I was there on the day it reopened and I listened to Prince Charles talk about why he got involved. Dumfries House had a special place in his affections, he told us, but he also wanted to do what he could for the people of Ayrshire.And he has. Partly, itrsquos been through some of the softer benefits Dumfries House has brought, such as a new book festival and classes for local children on food and farming. But there have been hard benefits too, such as new jobs. In fact, you may have read the testimony of some of the people whorsquove benefited in this way when The Herald featured their stories the other day.People like Graeme Bone, who took a course in one of the training centres at Dumfries House and now works on upcycling factory offcuts to make bags. ldquoItrsquos hard not to be inspired here, he said. Or Kris Muir, who used to be unemployed but is now a gardener on the estate. ldquoThis place has lted New Cumnock, he said.There are lots of other people like Mr Bone and Mr Muir in the villages around Dumfries House ndash in fact, the estate is now the second biggest employer in the county ndash and I think their stories matter because they undermine one of the traditional arguments of republicans, which is that the Royal Family costs too much. It sometimes seems like British citizens who take this viewwould apply a kind of reverse austerity to the country, stripping it of everything that glitters and leaving only the useful and the utilitarian they would reduce it all to figures that can be balanced on a spread sheet. Perhaps they could print it out and take it down the Mall in a horse and carriage and see what kind of reaction it gets.However, the truth is the Royal Family is more complicated, and wonderful, than that. I know that some royalists talk about the benefits to tourism but Irsquove never been entirely convinced by that argument ndash who can say how many visitors come because we have princesses and dukes  I would point out, instead, that the monarchy costs less than a pound per person per year, but more importantly I would point to the bag-maker Graeme Bone and the gardener Kris Muir and the thousands of others like them who live near me. Their lives have been improved by the influence of the Prince of Wales and the investment and attention he attracts.And anyway, money is never what really matters in the end is it, even with the royals  The other day, Prince William did the most extraordinary thing: he told young members of an LGBTQ group that he would be fine with any of his children being gay. It reminded me of the moment his mother put aside the prejudice of the s and shook the hand of an Aids patient without her gloves. It demonstrates, then and now, that an institution that is accused of being behind the times is often ahead of them.:Mark Smith: A new secret weapon in the fight against Scottish nationalism: the pamphlet of loveThink about this too: the Royal Family does cost a lot of money ndash in  , pound million ndash but so would the paraphernalia and pomp of its replacement: a president or head of state. And we need to think carefully about what we want to spend that kind of money on: a monarch who, in the age of populism, has an approval rating of some  per cent, or some of the alternatives Sadly, you know what they are: the Scottish nationalist in Bute House or the British nationalist whorsquos about to be in Number . Some people think those two would be value for money. I would rather spend my pound per year on something better."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-english-nationalism-demeans-our-politics","story":"English nationalism is not mentioned in Mr Smithrsquos column, but it is arguably the element which has driven Brexit and left the country in its present state of lemming-like idiocy. Is it not noticed by media commentators, because it has become so normalised and taken for granted  It does appear to be a signicant mote in Mr Smithrsquos eye and it greatly diminishes his arguments for a better style of politics.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.IT is a lovely idea that a kinder politics could flourish in Scotland rather than that which we have become accustomed to. Mark Smith points out that the remarkable victory of Ekrem Imamoglu as mayor of Istanbul was based on just such a strategy, having concluded that ldquoyou cannot fight polarising populists by being polarising.Those who have become hardened by the angry confrontation that so often accompanies exchanges over Scotlandrsquos constitutional future might think it naiumlve to imagine that we could get away from all that rancour, yet the Istanbul example shows otherwise. Turkish politics has after all suffered more than its fair share of isive and angry political struggles over the years.Personally, I believe one of the biggest turn-offs when it comes to considering future options for Scotland is the grievance-led narrative favoured by the SNP leadership. The challenge for those who value Scotlandrsquos positive place in the UK is to try to dfuse discord, and to emphasise the positives we share with family, friends, colleagues and fellow citizens across the UK. Many of the dferences that nationalists seek to exploit are short-term or exaggerated, whereas the advantages of being in the closest of possible unions have lasted over the course of many generations.Keith Howell, West Linton.RORY Stewart was right to be ldquoafraid of the word ldquolove in political discourse. All you need is love, said the Beatles, and that ended in an acid trip at Haight-Ashbury. Mark Smith seems to regard love as a political tool that might be utilised so that ldquowe might be able to take on popular movements that rely on national identity, such as Scottish nationalism. His particular brand of love does not seem to be universal. Who are ldquowe Tricky word, love. Professor William Barclay used to lecture us on prime-time telly, to the signature tune of Mendelssohnrsquos Scottish Symphony, on the dference between ldquoeros and ldquoagape . The trouble is that a lot of people who think they are in love are actually in a relationship of coercive abuse. The greatest act of love you can possibly bestow on a person about whom you are crazy, but who just isnrsquot right for you, is to let her go.Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.MARK Smith comments on the positive nature of ldquolove in the political sphere. What he doesnrsquot say is the first proponent of inclusive political positivity was Alex Salmond in the  referendum, and who always referred to our big southern neighbour with complementary affection. Of course his objective was Scottish self-government and his opponent was Anglo-British nationalism, the nationalism seldom referenced in the media. The term ldquoUnionist, in the time of Brexit surely being an oxymoron, and certainly contrary to majority opinion within the Tory Party.Mr Salmond gained nothing for his positivity, being told a Scottish English border would be ldquocustom posts, barbed wire, and armed guards: contrast that with the proposed ldquoinvisible border in Ireland. Or Scotland being rebuffed on a currency union, oddly this is now cast as the ldquoSNP ditching the pound by todays British nationalists.And there is not much love coming from the Tory leadership contest. What we are told by the contestants is that Scotland will not be ldquoallowed to be independent: that while border polls in Northern Ireland are guaranteed by international treaty , that winning elections with a Scottish electorate, or gaining a majority in Scotlandrsquos parliament is not ldquoa mandate for a plebiscite.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I NOTE with wry amusement the ambitions of Jo Swinson, prospective Liberal Democrat UK Leader .Ms Swinson will have no truck with the SNP or an independence referendum she hopes for a Liberal Democrat government after Brexit. Again we read about the LibDems breaking the mould of British politics, something they have forecast every time they make a small advance. The mould of British politics was well and truly broken by the Brexit Party in this yearrsquos European election  seats, with the LibDems on . I might also point out that the Tories got four and Labour .Two things she hinted at: she is not completely against co-operation with the Tories, despite their previous alliance with that party destroying any credibility the LibDems had. And her ambition to be Prime Minister would be dunted by the fact that there is a thing called English Votes for English Laws which could debar her from any Cabinet office on that score I am constantly surprised at the survival of David Mundell.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmAn innovative partnership between NHS Orkney and Girlguiding Orkney, aimed at raising awareness of antibiotic resistance, has picked up a national award.

HIAL have note received any further proposals for strike action.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s managing director said: “We are obviously disappointed that our latest offer has been rejected by Air Traffic Control Officers, despite enhancing our formal offer following last-minute discussions with Prospect.“It is unfortunate that the industrial action has been reinstated during the peak holiday period and I would like to apologise in advance to our passengers, customers and local communities for the disruption this will inevitably cause.“The offer was made within the parameters of the Scottish public pay policy in a bid to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of both parties.  We have encouraged Prospect to meet and discuss an alternative solution within the flexibilities afforded to the company. We remain committed to resolving this dispute and a meeting with Prospect will take place on Thursday  July.”David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “Prospect members in HIAL have overwhelmingly rejected the revised pay offer made by HIAL. The work to rule which was suspended during the ballot will restart tomorrow, Saturday, June . Prospect will meet with representatives on Monday to consider the ballot result prior to a meeting with HIAL on Thursday to try and resolve this dispute and reach an offer which is acceptable.”Responding to news of the rejected pay offer Orkney MSP Liam McArthur said: “This is deeply disappointing news. The long-running industrial dispute has already caused serious disruption to those using our leline air services and this now looks set to continue. With a busy summer period now underway, the potential impact of this action is likely to be greater than ever.“What is abundantly clear is that absolutely no-one benefits from this damaging dispute. I, therefore, urge the unions and HIAL to get back round the table as soon as possible and find a solution.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines. Today’s meeting in Edinburgh seems to be the last chance for input from outside government. I fully support the call made by Councillor Steven Coutts for an extension of the time for responses.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course. Ongoing funding will be needed to support the work of the local management group and allow coordination to take place.#The minister agreed to look at ways in which this might be achieved and to come back with more detailed thoughts in due course.“I am encouraged by the developments today but also determined to make sure that this now translates into effective action to address what has been a long-running issue affecting Orkney’s farming community”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’ve declared a climate emergency! However, it doesn’t really feel like an emergency yet. It feels more like waiting in an emergency room which is slowly filling up with impatient in-patients.All that’s happened so far is the Scottish Government has scrapped their proposed cuts on the air departure tax. An important move, as, given limited technological options, we need to curtail increasing aviation demand. Some people are afraid of flying. I think we need to make more people afraid of flying. Perhaps glass floors or actual snakes on a plane  A first step amongst many on the path to consistent decision-making across the economy. But we now need to even the playing field by taxing aviation properly compared to other forms of travel.The Committee on Climate Change’s advice is to make the UK emissions reduction target net-zero by  and that Scotland should do it even faster, by . In typical Scottish fashion, what will spur us on is proving we can do something better than the English. The race is on. You may take our condensing boilers but you’ll never take our freedom !It may very well be rivalry that spurs us on to greatness. Like Andy Murray in the tennis, it is the achievements of those around him that made him work harder to reach the top. Glasgow and Edinburgh are now in direct competition to become the UK’s first net-zero city. Having lived in both cities, I am looking forward to a wind turbine on the top of the Duke of Wellington’s cone and tourists’ footsteps on the Royal Mile powering local homes. If we could harness the unleashed rivalry of Scottish sports fans and turn that into something positive, like ‘nine in a row’ for largest emissions reductions, then we’d sort the problem in absolutely no time. We always want to feel we’re better than our neighbours so get out there, start telling Susan next door about how little you drive and watch her sell that Volvo and become an eco-warrior.: The proof that the private sector cannot secure just transition to green economy – Richard Leonard: Scotland fails to hit climate change targets for past two years in a rowWe have done well so far, especially on decarbonising the power sector, as Scotland’s actual emissions are now half what they were in , back when coal reigned supreme and wind power was virtually non-existent. That is the easy stuff. Heating is next and I don’t knowyou’ve noticed but we are a Baltic nation, so we use an awful lot of it. I think  per cent is my gran. However, there has been very little progress in emissions reductions in transport, agriculture, forestry and land-use sectors, although some plans are now in place.We need to drive electric cars but also have more car-sharing options and to drive less. Changes in road transport will also have extra benefits, mostly health related. Firstly, it will reduce air pollution which hopefully means the only filter kids will need on their face is on Snapchat. Parents often choose quieter routes to walk with their children, away from traffic, as this can cut pollution exposure by almost two-thirds. We’re so afraid of inconveniencing drivers that the people being poisoned are the ones having to change their behaviour. If we continue with that logic we’ll soon just be telling children to stop breathing.Secondly, there’s the benefits of walking and cycling more. Run to the gym to cancel your membership. Then there is changing our diets. To cut emissions I have changed my milk. I now only drink oat milk, which is especially weird when I have it in my porridge. Oat on oat action. I feel like the most Scottish man in the world. I want my oats ground into liquid and poured over more oats. I’ve also gone from eating meat in most meals to only a couple times a week, which has been hard as I like a burger as much as the next Five Guys.In Scotland, it is quite clear that the view on the role of the oil and gas industry has changed since the independence referendum in . This industry which has given us all so much will, whether as part of the UK or not, need to be mostly dismantled over the coming decades. Here, with the current expertise, we have the opportunity to become a world leader in carbon capture and storage that will be required for hard to decarbonise sectors in industry. But it requires signicant policy support to come to fruition.It has been quite the year for climate change in Scotland. School strikes, dire climate reports, wildfires, protesters gluing themselves to buildings, and the warmest February on record. And now a climate emergency. It feels like a turning point. I started my PhD on this very topic about  years ago. Back then we were the first nation to introduce legislation on limiting our contribution to climate change. We paved the way and other countries followed suit. We now have  years to reduce global emissions by  per cent in order to stay below .C increase. It’s time for us to show the way once again and finish the job. Show them how it’s done.However, we cannot underestimate the scale of the challenge required. Achieving this is going to require everybody throwing everything at the wall. This will not be easy. Almost every aspect of society will see signicant adjustments. How you get to work, where you work, how and where you take holidays, what you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner, what you buy, and how your home is heated. People often say we could do with a war, well here it is, it’s against our carbon-intensive society. Treat it like an emergency and do your part in your personal, professional and political lives.Matt Winning is a comedian and podcaster of Operation Earth, who works by day as an environmental economist at the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources.

Members’ travel and accommodation and other reasonable expenses, such as child care, will also be reimbursed.The first meeting will be held in Edinburgh, with subsequent meetings in Glasgow. Details of the venues have yet to be released.David Martin, the former Labour MEP chosen to chair the group, has appealed for the Conservatives and Lib Dems to give it another chance after the parties announced they would not work with it.Pro-Union group Scotland in Union warned the assembly could be “misused” by only promoting the idea of breaking away from the UK.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course.

Our patrols also act as a means of deterrent to offenders and to reassure residents that patrols are being undertaken. Patrols are carried out on foot, bicycle, in marked and unmarked council vehicles and in private vehicles.“In order to try and tackle part of the problem, council has also adopted a robust enforcement policy in relation to stray dogs.”The spokesperson continued: “We also know that there unfortunately remains a small number of irresponsible dog owners who fail to clean up after their dog whilst out walking or by owners letting their dogs out of the house or pen to run around the neighbourhood late at night or early in the morning to foul. Dog owners know it is not acceptable to leave dog foul lying in the park or on the pavement. The message is clear, ‘Your Dog, Your Mess, Your Responsibility’.”Council initiatives aimed at tackling the issue of dog fouling include educating people about the importance of responsible dog ownership, the Green Dog Walker scheme encouraging people to clean up after their pets and the ‘Fed Up With Fouling’ campaign, which encourages people to report fouling offences.“Other ideas to tackle irresponsible dog owners are currently being developed as part of the Clean Neighbourhood project. These include the design of new publicity materials and introduction of dog control areas,” the spokesperson added.Anyone who witnesses a dog fouling offence is asked to report it to the council’s Enforcement Officers on    or by email - ehealth@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.ukThe council can issue fixed penalty fines by postit has the date, time and location of the incident, the name and address of the ownerand a description of the dog.Dromara and Community Art Group Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"day two of the balmoral show in partnership with ulster bank at balmoral park outside lisburn","story":"The weather stayed kind for visitors and exhibitors at the annual show window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringThursday  May  :Picture DeskPictures from PressEye and Pacemaker PressPACEMAKER BELFAST  :Day two of the Balmoral Show at Balmoral Park outside Lisburn.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ardoyne dancers top of the world","story":"AN Ardoyne-based Irish dancing school are celebrating after their success at the An Chomhdhail World Championships in Killarney.Lawrenson-Toal Academy of Irish Dance brought home a world champion to North Belfast with Caragh Hendron scooping first place in the under- category.

That completely misses the basic point that in any democracy you are very likely to see or hear things with which you may disagree.  “A shared future – by any reasonable definition - means that Orange Parades should be facilitated not prevented. The Orange Order is part of the rich history of Belfast, and the lack of tolerance shown towards the Order is a problem that must be addressed.” Its the fourth year the parade has been restricted.The Parades Commission said it restricted the parade after considering its potential for public disorder and its impact on community relations and community le.In its determination it noted the \"tensions\" surrounding the parade, in particular at the peace line at Workman Avenue. It stated the parade organisers had not engaged with the local community in a bid to broker a local agreement. The Nationalist community in the area, the Parades Commission said, had said an agreement was \"feasible\" to allow the parade to pass. The Parades Commission Code of Conduct statesa parade is to \"pass through an area where the majority population is from a dferent tradition, or through an interface area, it would be important for the organiser to take steps to establish a line of communication\".\"Efforts should be made to meet reasonable concerns of residents.\"The Parades Commission added: \"Such an accommodation would build confidence within both communities but requires dialogue between parade organisers and residents groups.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In principle, we all want this tribunal to work and be effective, but in doing so we have to make sure that women and their families see it as the best route and it’s as inclusive as possible.“There’s a cohort of women who are outside of this and are almost blindsided by the fact that they could have been advised for many dferent reasons not to go through the RCOG review, and because they didn’t go through they don’t have access now.“That can’t happen so we have got to find a solution. They have to have the option.“We can pass this legislation, but we can do so with an amendment that there will be a mechanism found to deal with these women who are outside this process.”Mr Harris said that no one chose to enter the RCOG process as a “passport” to go into the tribunal because no one knew about the existence of the tribunal at the time.He added: “Women who chose to do it to have the option as having an independent external review of their screening history and a determination or notthere was a discordance.“I would respectfully suggest that I would reflect and engage further with members of this committee between now and report stage.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs Mr Weber, the German conservative whose centre-right EPP is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and government experience for such a high-profile role.Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EU’s only elected institution.Mrs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, the top centre-left candidate from the SD group, to be among the winners of the top positions. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the EU summit Other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The EPP and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU, but both lost seats in May’s polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker. The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia. Others mentioned include Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier of France, Greens leader Ska Keller of Germany, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief since .On Monday a spokesman for Mr Tusk said the summit had been suspended and would reconvene on Tuesday morning."},{"url":null,"title":"campbell welcomes confirmation dup role securing winter fuel payments","story":"East Derry MP Gregory Campbell has welcomed confirmation from the British government that Winter Fuel Payments will remain a universal benefit for all older people thanks to the DUP’s Confidence and Supply Agreement.Mr Campbell received the assurance following a Parliamentary Question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on means testing of the benefit.Commenting, the DUP MP said: “The decision by the BBC to remove free TV licences from over-s has renewed the focus on universal benefits for our older people.“The future of some universal benefits was drawn into question at the last General Election, but thanks to action from the DUP, a commitment to maintain the pensions triple lock and the universal nature of Winter Fuel Payments was secured.”\"The Winter Fuel Payment is extremely important for many people to ensure they are able to live more comfortably during the colder months of the year. I asked the Chancellor about recent speculation regarding means testing and there was a definitive answer:“The Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party sets out that there will be no change to the universal nature of the Winter Fuel Payment.”He continued: “This is a clear and specic confirmation relating to just one element of what the DUP has already secured through the Confidence and Supply Agreement. It is also a reminder that this agreement was not designed to deliver for sectional interests, but for everyone in our society and applies both in Northern Ireland and right across the whole of the United Kingdom.“Older people in particular should take heart from this statement.

One will not understand this feelinghe is not hungry or thirsty themselves.“The Muslim community in the city has merged these two principles together to raise donation for the people who need food to feed their families.“There is no better time to run this campaign than the month of Ramadan and there is no better local charity to support this good cause than Foyle Foodbank.“We are collaborating with Foyle Foodbank third year in a row for Ramadan fasting challenge. We managed to raise £, first year, £, second year and £, this year with our Ramadan charity fasting challenge donation project.”Foyle Foodbank manager James McMenamin thanked the NW Islamic Association for their continued support.“There has been a steady increase in the amount of money they have donated each year. This enables us to buy food that we’re running low on and will also help with teaching courses in debt management.”InclusionEach year in the month of Ramadan the North West Islamic Association invites members of the local community to take part in a fasting challenge where participants fast for a few hours up to full day depending upon their capability and preference.Families, friends and colleagues sponsor the participants by donating money.“At North West Islamic community centre we also run this donation appeal and set up donation box as well. Most of the people from Muslim community who attend for prayer and other events put money in this box to support this campaign as well in addition to show support for the participants,” Mr Bahli said.“The most impressive thing is that kids at the Islamic community centre break their kitty boxes to participate in this campaign.“All the participants are invited to join the Muslim community at the time of breaking the fast in Islamic community centre on the day of the challenge. There are a selection of dishes prepared for this day by the Muslim families from dferent countries“This project strengthens the bonds between communities and helps to know each other and to understand ious cultures and traditions in a multicultural environment. There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public purse and Sinn Féin believes payments should be paid over a timescale which “protects the viability of public services and businesses.\"Ulster Unionist Finance Spokesperson, Steve Aiken MLA, said “urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
