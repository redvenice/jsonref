Pictured: A container ship docked at a Qingdao port on July 6Washington imposed 25 percent duties on $34billion of Chinese goods on July 6 in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing retaliated by imposing similar charges on the same amount of US products.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman had earlier called on Washington to \u0027come to its senses\u0027 and settle the dispute.NRA has gone BROKE and \u0027may soon be unable to exist\u0027, court...Share this articleChinese leaders have offered to narrow their politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more American goods, but they have rejected changing technology development plans they see as a path to prosperity and global influence.There\u0027s no end in sight, and the dispute could chill global trade and economic growth.China\u0027s new threat targeting a smaller amount of US goods reflects the fact that Beijing is running out of products for retaliation due to its lopsided trade balance with the United States.China\u0027s imports from the United States last year totaled $153.9billion. After the earlier tariffs $34billion of US goods, about $120billion is available for retaliation.The highest penalties on the new list would be imposed on honey, vegetables, mushrooms and chemicals, targeting farming and mining areas that supported President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The new list includes products as varied as snow blowers and 3D printers, suggesting Chinese authorities are struggling to find enough imports their own economy can do without.          White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a briefing Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027Beijing\u0027s earlier round of tariffs appeared designed to minimize the impact on the Chinese economy by targeting soybeans, whiskey and other goods available from Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.Trump initially proposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200billion of Chinese imports, but he told trade officials this week to consider raising that to 25 percent. It will be September at the earliest before the U.S. decides whether to impose those tariffs.Chinese authorities warned earlier that if the dispute escalated, they would adopt unspecified \u0027comprehensive measures.\u0027 That prompted concern among American companies that retaliation might expand to disrupting their operations in China.The United States and China have the world\u0027s biggest trading relationship but official ties are increasingly strained over complaints that Beijing\u0027s technology development tactics hurt American companies.Trump\u0027s tariffs target goods the White House says benefit from industrial policies such as \u0027Made in China 2025\u0027, which calls for developing Chinese competitors in robotic, artificial intelligence and other fields.The dispute is part of broader US complaints about global trading conditions that have prompted Trump to raise duties on steel, aluminum, washing machines or solar panels from Canada, Europe, Japan and South Korea.A spokesman for China\u0027s foreign ministry appealed to Washington to negotiate but could not confirm reports the two sides were setting up talks.\u0027We urge the United States to come to its senses, correct its erroneous acts and create the necessary condition for a proper settlement as soon as possible,\u0027 spokesman Geng Shuang said.Trump campaigned on a promise to bring down America\u0027s massive trade deficits by renegotiating trade agreements and getting tough on countries like China that sell the U.S. far more than they buy from it.But the US Commerce Department reported Friday that the American trade deficit climbed to $46.3billion in June from $43.2billion in May. The deficit in goods trade with China also rose. So far this year, the trade gap is up more than seven percent from January-June 2017."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/02/09/4EC164CD00000578-0-image-m-10_1533198871710.jpg","title":"Seth Rogen apologizes child stunt double latest film blackface","story":"    A child actor was put in blackface on the set of Seth Rogen\u0027s new film to match the skin tone of the star he was standing in for  He had dark brown makeup applied to more closely resemble 11-year-old actor Keith L Williams (right), who has darker skinRogen said he was not aware the child\u0027s skin was darkened and ordered the practice to stop immediately when he found out.The comedy actor who is one of three producers on the film said it \u0027shouldn\u0027t have happened\u0027 and he was terribly sorry\u0027 that it did.\u0027I won\u0027t give excuses for why it happened.

The event takes its name from the 1976 comedy movie The Gumball Rally and raises funds for youth projects.Cooper also reportedly chose the term ‘Gumball’ to describe the rally because iconic artist Andy Warhol used it to describe the way that the population chews up and eventually spits out pop culture like gum.The inaugural rally, in which Cooper and about 50 of his friends participated, took place between London and Rimini, Italy, passing through cities like Paris along the way.The 2001 rally, which stretched between London and Berlin, Germany, is often seen as a turning point for the race as its popularity and global awareness rose sharply around that time.In 2002, the rally moved from Europe to the United States, starting in New York City and ending in Los Angeles, California, passing iconic landmarks like the White House in Washington, D.C. and the Grand Canyon in Arizona along the way.In 2004, the race returned to Europe, taking place between Paris and Cannes, France. Sadly, the 2007 rally ended early after a traffic accident in Macedonia resulted in the deaths of two nonparticipants.The 2008 and 2009 rallies were held entirely in the United States while the 2010 rally was notably the first transatlantic race as participants were flown between Europe and the U.S. The 2014 and 2015 rallies also featured a similar transatlantic route, flying participants between Miami, Florida and Ibiza, Spain in 2014 and Stockholm, Sweden and Las Vegas in 2015.When is the 2018 Gumball 3000 Rally?The rally is set to begin on Saturday, August 4 and continue until Sunday, August 12.2018 Gumball 3000 Rally trophyTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the rally, Asprey has made a new ‘Spirit of Gumball’ trophy to mark the event.

And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.\u0027So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. I want you to challenge yourself.\u0027I want you to stop gossiping, to try a food that scares you, to buy a coffee for someone just because, to tell someone you love them…and then to tell yourself right back.

My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.\u0027Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So every day during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and 1pm, I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone,’ she wrote.For her birthday, Markle is reportedly planning to celebrate in Surrey at the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee, one of Prince Harry’s best friends who also served as an usher at the Royal Wedding.Per Royal tradition, birthdays are usually low-key affairs celebrated at home.

Julia Bradbury inside her holiday home in Portugal before it was done up in a new six-part series for ITV          The Portugese property, which she purchased £10,000, looks unrecognisable after renovationsThe six-parter, which begins on Tuesday, discovers holiday hideaways in a treehouse, shepherd’s huts, a river boat, troglodyte caves, and other homes in more traditional bricks and mortar. The countries they were found in include Bulgaria, Spain, France, Hungary and the region that captured Julia’s heart – northern Portugal. She found herself there in May last year after giving up on her dream of buying in the Algarve, where property was well beyond her budget.The Little Blue House, as it’s known, became hers in June 2017. A dozen visits, some which saw Julia flying out from the UK, others involving a detour while on the road filming elsewhere in Portugal, helped ensure its renovation was finished by last September.          The Portuguese property Julia Bradbury bought for £5,700 and renovated for less than £5,000‘I saved money by haggling over the asking price and then cheekily requesting all the rustic furniture be included in the deal too. The final purchase price was £5,700. I spent about £900 on legal fees, and the remainder went on tradesmen and building materials. Spectacular mansion where the Queen\u0027s party planner made her...One in three back property to pay for retirement: Britons...Share this articleI allowed myself a contingency fund, and when I discovered the nastiest of plumbing problems – a cesspit under the bathroom – I was very glad of it.’As well as extensive plumbing, Julia had to have the house connected to mains electricity and rewired, the kitchen and bathroom refurbished and the whole place made snug and secure. In the show she is seen calling on her friend, TV salvage expert Max McMurdo, for ideas and practical help.‘I’m pretty handy with a sledgehammer, am happy to try tiling and anyone can paint a wall, but Max was the one who said, “Bradbury, I’ve found a way to turn your entire staircase around,” ’ she laughs.          Basics: The primitive but stylish kitchen sink area in Julia’s idyllic cottageAnother friend who speaks Portuguese also proved invaluable, liaising with builders and keeping neighbours informed of developments. ‘I can speak enough Portuguese to order a custard tart and a cup of coffee,’ says Julia. ‘As with any project anywhere, I had issues with builders, including one who tried to get us to install a lighting system that would have lit up a mansion, never mind my one-up, one-down cottage. We agreed a deal with him and then he disappeared anyway. That’s not the kind of problem you can solve with sign language.’Max’s innovative approach and zeal for recycling helped turn Julia’s cottage into a budget-friendly bolthole. ‘For example, he helped me create a pulley-system partition with bunk beds attached which slides across the master bedroom, iding one big room into two smaller spaces. The idea works well and it gives us – a family of five – the space we need,’ she says.Julia hopes to spend at least a couple of weeks a year in Portugal as she takes a break from her hectic filming schedule. Friends and family have an open invitation too.

He was arrested as soon as he hit Braintree High Street, stark naked, semi-raving and certified by Braintree police as suffering from ‘heat insanity’. Then, like now, it was a summer of unprecedented heat lasting from May to September, as temperatures rocketed above 100F. This was the steamy backdrop for another big Royal event (a Coronation of a new King) and an official visit to London by a controversial potentate – not Donald Trump, but the German Kaiser, the new monarch’s power-hungry first cousin whom no one quite trusted to be Britain’s friend.          The heat was too much for these men who fell asleep in the park on the hot summer\u0027s dayIn some ways 1911 is a world lost to us, a past that is a foreign country where they did things differently, where cars were outnumbered by horse-drawn carriages, where motorised fire engines tested their water jets for the first time on St Paul’s Cathedral, and where the only means of mass communication other than newspapers was to be found in the crowds attending every national and local event.The European Union was still two world wars away and Brexit a term 100 years from being invented.Yet then, too, Britain seemed as if it was on the edge of momentous change. Germany, with whom we had such a ‘special relationship’, felt menacing, a fear that would prove well-founded. Scorched Earth: Spain hits near-record temperatures of 108F...Hot, deadly summer on the way: The terrifying map that shows...Share this articleThe country was in conflict. But it wasn’t Brexit that ided the nation. The railway and dockers’ unions went on strike and women, campaigning for the vote, lost all confidence in the Prime Minister.Some wonder if anything much has changed. Despite the sunny, blue-sky idyll of this summer, we share with the Edwardians a sense of foreboding about what fearful news might be on the horizon when the rain eventually arrives.Heat affected everyone, no matter what their background. The fashion pages today are full of the scantiest swimsuits and T-shirts aimed at coping with the heat. It is easy to forget the advantages we have over the super-clothed, electricity-deprived, unrefrigerated, sunburnt Edwardians – and I’m not just thinking of our air-con, plentiful ice cream and sunblock.          Women try to avoid the sun in 1911 with parasols and wide-brimmed hatsOn June 22, 1911, the peers and their peeresses arrived at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of George V and his wife, Queen Mary, in full ermine rig, tiaras and ball gowns. Knowing the service would last several hours cucumber sandwiches had been hidden in the silk lining of their coronets. As the heat in the abbey rose, so the butter began to melt and rivulets of grease ran down their lordships’ faces on to the service sheets.In August, those same butter-drenched lords – who made up the few hundred families who collectively owned a quarter of the country – saw their voting rights restricted in the Parliament Bill. They would not be able to obstruct a Bill passed by the House of Commons for longer than two years. Many thought this was the beginning of the end.For some, the exuberance of life continued unextinguished by heat and enhanced by the long daylight hours. Socialites crammed in their usual programme of gaiety as intensively as the poor made their grievances apparent. It was as if time was running out.If today we have been engrossed by the antics of Love Island, 1911 saw sell-out audiences for the mesmerisingly sexy Ballets Russes at Covent Garden, brought to England for the first time by the impresario Serge Diaghilev. His lover Nijinsky spellbound audiences with his gravity-defying leaps.          Some like it hot! Boys bathe naked in London\u0027s Regent\u0027s CanalThe ballet enchanted Rupert Brooke, a young poet at work during the day on his first volume of poetry, spending evenings swimming naked in the river near his home in Grantchester and travelling up to London for the ballet 17 times that summer.For others, the sunshine guaranteed the summer of their lives. Beaches up and down the country were packed. Bathing huts in Brighton preserved the modesty of those pulled down to the water’s edge by horses or muscly young men before they were released into the waves without revealing so much as a naked ankle. Up on dry land, ladies in their finest lawn tea dresses twirled their lacy, voile parasols as they promenaded along the seashore for onlookers to admire.Those unable to afford the rent for a deckchair simply stood and stared. Brian Calkin, a young St Paul’s choirboy who had been lucky enough to be chosen to sing at the Coronation on June 22, was spending his summer holidays with his family in Felixstowe. There were donkey rides, fortune-tellers, candyfloss sellers and ‘real-live’ mermaids complete with long rubbery tails. One day when the summers of his childhood were over, Brian privately pledged he would join the Army even if he had to fudge his date of birth. He did just that, and died defending his country in July 1918.Of course the Edwardians lived in a more innocent, technology-free age when the public were ‘protected’ from knowing what did not concern them. Press control was absolute, with the editors of newspapers co-operating with the Government and Royal Family to keep confidential or alarming stories out of their pages. Tweets were several lifetimes away and transgressions were rare and dealt with at once.No prying lenses penetrated the basement of the swanky RAC Club in Piccadilly where the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill, and his friend and lodger, Foreign Secretary Edward Grey, pounded up and down the brand-new, mosaic-lined swimming pool discussing in total privacy the impending domestic and foreign crises for which both men were responsible.On July 1, just ten days after the bellicose Kaiser, Queen Victoria’s grandson, strode up Westminster Abbey’s red carpet as guest of honour at the Coronation, a German warship had sailed towards North Africa and invaded Agadir in French-occupied Morocco France was Britain’s ally. The story at home was no less alarming. The suffragettes had all but given up hope in their dealings with the indecisive Liberal Prime Minister Herbert Asquith. In response to his procrastination over their campaign for the vote, the violence of suffrage action was in danger of sabotaging itself. In 1911, in deference to the respect they held for the monarchy, the suffragettes promised to stick to a summer truce if Asquith would act on their case in the autumn.           Star turn: World famous ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky danced in Covent Garden in 1911When, in August, the newly crowned George V and his family escaped from London and the public eye for a private holiday on the Isle of Wight, the paparazzi found them snatching a pre-breakfast swim in Osborne Bay.After photographers jostled to get shots of the sovereign and his heir in voluminous swimming dress, Buckingham Palace issued a statement: ‘If less objectionable behaviour is not observed by photographers they are warned that steps will be taken to stop the nuisance.’ Some things never change. Fears of an impending war were confined to the most senior members of the Cabinet. But although Britain was at peace, there was an eerily familiar feeling of unease at the heart of society, not least among the women who worked under horrifying conditions in Victorian-era factories.By the middle of August, the workers at Bermondsey’s jam factories had suffered enough of the boiling, sugary liquid that spat at and burned their bodies.They dressed in their Sunday best – laced-up boots and feather-decked hats – and took to the sweltering streets. They were joined by pickle-makers, tea-packers, glue-mixers and biscuit-bakers.Although trade unions were still in their infancy, Mary Macarthur, a chain worker, negotiated on behalf of all her co-workers and, miraculously, an increase in wages was eventually agreed.The women returned to work two weeks later, armed not with the vote but with more money and an unprecedented sense of self-reliance, solidarity and optimism about women’s position in the workplace.Negotiations by the men who went on strike that summer were not so successful. Several thousand dockworkers and railway men had downed tools to protest against irregular employment and atrocious working conditions. Haunches of beef arriving by ship from South America lay unpacked, stinking and rotting on quaysides up and down the country. Dry goods remained undelivered as trains stayed motionless in sidings, the drivers inflexible until their pay disputes could be settled.Despite precautionary stockpiling of food and medicines, much of Britain approached standstill, teetering on the brink of catastrophic illness and famine.The 36-year-old Home Secretary, Winston Churchill (who had himself almost been pushed under a train a couple of years earlier by an exasperated suffragette), sent troops to parts of the country where rioting had erupted.By August, the effects of a rain-free summer had taken hold. Wells dried up and thousands of livestock perished through lack of water. In the parched countryside, birds lost the energy to sing. Each week there were reports of children who had not learned to swim but, longing for coolness, drowned in the shallowest of ponds.Schoolgirl Amy Reeves, aged ten, took off her boots and stockings and left them on the grass beside a shallow lake at Chertsey in Surrey. She was discovered later that afternoon, her head caught in the weeds beneath the water.In the slum areas of big cities, cholera and typhoid began to spread.

It has led to repeated attempts by Left-wing activists in the pro-Corbyn Momentum group to sack her as MP for Liverpool Riverside.A former aide to Mr Corbyn told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard him describe Dame Louise sarcastically as \u0027the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv\u0027 when her name was mentioned. \u0027I was very surprised and when I asked other members of staff they said he often did it in private, though not to her face,\u0027 said the Labour insider.          The \u0027spiteful\u0027 jibe by the Labour leader was reportedly aimed at Louise Ellman (pictured)Another senior Labour source said Dame Louise was commonly referred to as \u0027the Hon Member of Tel Aviv\u0027 by members of Mr Corbyn\u0027s staff. \u0027If her name crops up, or she appears on the office TV, they\u0027ll say, \u0027There she goes again, the Honourable member for Tel Aviv.\u0027 They can\u0027t stand her.\u0027 Last night, Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, condemned Mr Corbyn\u0027s \u0027spiteful\u0027 comment.Born into a Jewish family in Manchester, Dame Louise, 72, was chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement until 2016 and is vice chairman of the Labour Friends of Israel. She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years.

In her tweet, Ms Laing said she had had a ‘busy and productive week’ in the UK. A delighted Mr Mnangagwa was first to respond on Twitter, telling her that Zimbabwe’s prospects were ‘as bright and positive as your wonderful scarf’.Ex-Zimbabwean cabinet minister Jonathan Moyo accused Ms Laing of wearing a ‘dictator’s voodoo scarf’ and endorsing a ‘mass murderer’.An ally of Mr Chamisa told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Putting lipstick on a crocodile shouldn’t work, but it didn’t stop the ambassador trying.UK to DOUBLE aid cash handouts: Bill for debit card scheme...Share this article‘Everyone who has cosied up to this monster should be ashamed after his narrow win.

It was a ‘Christmas present from the designer’ and she ‘had it long before anyone else’.She was ‘not supporting anyone or anything other than a better future for Zimbabwe’, she said. She also denied backing police violence.There was similar criticism in 2016 when a photograph of a beaming Ms Laing and Mr Mnangagwa appeared after her ‘courtesy call’ to his headquarters in Harare.The British Embassy denied Ms Laing had sided with Mr Mnangagwa, saying it had spent £24 million on trying to ensure a fair election.‘Would we bother if we wanted one candidate to win?’ said a British diplomat.The Foreign Office announced in June that Ms Laing is leaving Zimbabwe to become Ambassador to Nigeria.

Pictured: A container ship docked at a Qingdao port on July 6Washington imposed 25 percent duties on $34billion of Chinese goods on July 6 in response to complaints Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. Beijing retaliated by imposing similar charges on the same amount of US products.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman had earlier called on Washington to \u0027come to its senses\u0027 and settle the dispute.NRA has gone BROKE and \u0027may soon be unable to exist\u0027, court...Share this articleChinese leaders have offered to narrow their politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States by purchasing more American goods, but they have rejected changing technology development plans they see as a path to prosperity and global influence.There\u0027s no end in sight, and the dispute could chill global trade and economic growth.China\u0027s new threat targeting a smaller amount of US goods reflects the fact that Beijing is running out of products for retaliation due to its lopsided trade balance with the United States.China\u0027s imports from the United States last year totaled $153.9billion. After the earlier tariffs $34billion of US goods, about $120billion is available for retaliation.The highest penalties on the new list would be imposed on honey, vegetables, mushrooms and chemicals, targeting farming and mining areas that supported President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.The new list includes products as varied as snow blowers and 3D printers, suggesting Chinese authorities are struggling to find enough imports their own economy can do without.          White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a briefing Friday that \u0027instead of retaliating, China should address longstanding concerns about its unfair trading practices\u0027Beijing\u0027s earlier round of tariffs appeared designed to minimize the impact on the Chinese economy by targeting soybeans, whiskey and other goods available from Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.Trump initially proposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200billion of Chinese imports, but he told trade officials this week to consider raising that to 25 percent. It will be September at the earliest before the U.S. decides whether to impose those tariffs.Chinese authorities warned earlier that if the dispute escalated, they would adopt unspecified \u0027comprehensive measures.\u0027 That prompted concern among American companies that retaliation might expand to disrupting their operations in China.The United States and China have the world\u0027s biggest trading relationship but official ties are increasingly strained over complaints that Beijing\u0027s technology development tactics hurt American companies.Trump\u0027s tariffs target goods the White House says benefit from industrial policies such as \u0027Made in China 2025\u0027, which calls for developing Chinese competitors in robotic, artificial intelligence and other fields.The dispute is part of broader US complaints about global trading conditions that have prompted Trump to raise duties on steel, aluminum, washing machines or solar panels from Canada, Europe, Japan and South Korea.A spokesman for China\u0027s foreign ministry appealed to Washington to negotiate but could not confirm reports the two sides were setting up talks.\u0027We urge the United States to come to its senses, correct its erroneous acts and create the necessary condition for a proper settlement as soon as possible,\u0027 spokesman Geng Shuang said.Trump campaigned on a promise to bring down America\u0027s massive trade deficits by renegotiating trade agreements and getting tough on countries like China that sell the U.S. far more than they buy from it.But the US Commerce Department reported Friday that the American trade deficit climbed to $46.3billion in June from $43.2billion in May. The deficit in goods trade with China also rose. So far this year, the trade gap is up more than seven percent from January-June 2017."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/15/4ED24E5900000578-6026421-image-a-24_1533392403111.jpg","title":"Prince Harry Meghan spotted friends wedding","story":"    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex held hands in a public display of affection following the wedding ceremony in Frensham earlier today          The Duchess of Sussex was seen enjoying a joke outside the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Frensham, before the wedding          Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, walk out of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, after the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee          The happy couple looked delighted as they made their way out of the church on three wheels          Meghan\u0027s 37th birthday celebrations today were vastly different to her last.

Julia Bradbury inside her holiday home in Portugal before it was done up in a new six-part series for ITV          The Portugese property, which she purchased £10,000, looks unrecognisable after renovationsThe six-parter, which begins on Tuesday, discovers holiday hideaways in a treehouse, shepherd’s huts, a river boat, troglodyte caves, and other homes in more traditional bricks and mortar. The countries they were found in include Bulgaria, Spain, France, Hungary and the region that captured Julia’s heart – northern Portugal. She found herself there in May last year after giving up on her dream of buying in the Algarve, where property was well beyond her budget.The Little Blue House, as it’s known, became hers in June 2017. A dozen visits, some which saw Julia flying out from the UK, others involving a detour while on the road filming elsewhere in Portugal, helped ensure its renovation was finished by last September.          The Portuguese property Julia Bradbury bought for £5,700 and renovated for less than £5,000‘I saved money by haggling over the asking price and then cheekily requesting all the rustic furniture be included in the deal too. The final purchase price was £5,700. I spent about £900 on legal fees, and the remainder went on tradesmen and building materials. Spectacular mansion where the Queen\u0027s party planner made her...One in three back property to pay for retirement: Britons...Share this articleI allowed myself a contingency fund, and when I discovered the nastiest of plumbing problems – a cesspit under the bathroom – I was very glad of it.’As well as extensive plumbing, Julia had to have the house connected to mains electricity and rewired, the kitchen and bathroom refurbished and the whole place made snug and secure. In the show she is seen calling on her friend, TV salvage expert Max McMurdo, for ideas and practical help.‘I’m pretty handy with a sledgehammer, am happy to try tiling and anyone can paint a wall, but Max was the one who said, “Bradbury, I’ve found a way to turn your entire staircase around,” ’ she laughs.          Basics: The primitive but stylish kitchen sink area in Julia’s idyllic cottageAnother friend who speaks Portuguese also proved invaluable, liaising with builders and keeping neighbours informed of developments. ‘I can speak enough Portuguese to order a custard tart and a cup of coffee,’ says Julia. ‘As with any project anywhere, I had issues with builders, including one who tried to get us to install a lighting system that would have lit up a mansion, never mind my one-up, one-down cottage. We agreed a deal with him and then he disappeared anyway. That’s not the kind of problem you can solve with sign language.’Max’s innovative approach and zeal for recycling helped turn Julia’s cottage into a budget-friendly bolthole. ‘For example, he helped me create a pulley-system partition with bunk beds attached which slides across the master bedroom, iding one big room into two smaller spaces. The idea works well and it gives us – a family of five – the space we need,’ she says.Julia hopes to spend at least a couple of weeks a year in Portugal as she takes a break from her hectic filming schedule. Friends and family have an open invitation too.

It has led to repeated attempts by Left-wing activists in the pro-Corbyn Momentum group to sack her as MP for Liverpool Riverside.A former aide to Mr Corbyn told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard him describe Dame Louise sarcastically as \u0027the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv\u0027 when her name was mentioned. \u0027I was very surprised and when I asked other members of staff they said he often did it in private, though not to her face,\u0027 said the Labour insider.

She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years.

It was only returned in 2015, and since then, he has lived in self-imposed exile in Berlin.Ai had been expecting to leave the studio soon, his assistant Ga Rang told AFP, because the rental contract on the space had expired last autumn.However, Ga said, it had not been possible to remove all the artwork stored in the space because there was so much of it, and the sudden destruction put some of it at risk. “They came and started knocking down the windows today without telling us beforehand. There’s still so much stuff inside.”It was not clear if the destruction was targeting Ai directly.

To explain his predicament and his dejected air, just look at his location. He is standing in Queens, across the river from Manhattan although the Queensboro Bridge connects the factories and taxi garages of Long Island City with the penthouses and roof gardens of the Upper East Side, he remains stranded in what snooty Manhattanites call “the outer boroughs”.In the hazy distance, the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan are out of reach and almost out of sight. Under the bridge’s anchorage there is another barrier – the ruins of the asylums, quarantine hospitals and penitentiaries on Roosevelt Island, a sliver of rock in the East River where New York once confined those it considered insane, infectious or unrespectable. In the 1920s Mae West was briefly locked up there as punishment for being too sexy (though she revenged herself by romancing the prison warden). Half a century after Evelyn Hofer took the photograph, the exclusion zone has widened. That grassy verge has been privatised: the Queens shoreline is now occupied by a glazed rampart of forbiddingly expensive apartment towers. Roosevelt Island too is a dormitory for the rich, with a park that ironically commemorates the American freedoms extolled by President Franklin D Roosevelt – elusive ideals, still not available to\u0026nbspall.Hofer’s subject is pausing to consider his options.

The short-term loan firm said the development was a way of coping with a surge in claims from former customers seeking compensation.The claims, said Wonga, related to loans taken out before 2014, when outrage over its payday lending offers prompted new rules to cap the cost of borrowing. The UK’s payday lending industry has been criticised by campaigners who claim its high interest rates and marketing tactics unfairly target vulnerable borrowers. A Wonga spokesman, confirming the £10m injection, said its shareholders remained “fully supportive of management’s plans for the business”. “Wonga continues to make progress against the transformation plan set out for the business. In recent months, however, the short-term credit industry has seen a marked increase in claims related to legacy loans, driven principally by claims management company activity.” The lender was forced to scrap its business model after running into regulatory problems and because of the cap on loan rates introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2015.Wonga announced a loss of nearly £65m in 2016, but insisted it was on track to return to profitability in 2017. The company has had a controversial past. In 2015, an inquest into the death of Kane Sparham-Price, a disabled teenager from Greater Manchester, found that he had had “numerous problems including those connected with his mental health”. He killed himself on the same day that Wonga emptied out his bank account for debts he owed the firm.The archbishop of Canterbury attacked payday lenders in 2013, claiming they had destroyed lives and said that he wanted to “compete Wonga out of existence”.

In just the same way the performers’ pavement-blocking antics inexplicably seem to. “Oh look, how marvellous – he’s swallowing fire and he needs a haircut! Let’s go and stand around that for a bit. Oh great! I mean, it’s a bit repetitive but, in my mind’s eye, I’m watching us watch this and it’s exactly how I imagined the weekend. Pity about the overpowering smell of paraffin.”Once you hit middle age, you might as well be honest about what you dislike – unless you’re running a political party, in which case it can be more prudent to keep it to yourself. Intellectually, I know that buskers probably possess the same average level of niceness as the wider population, but if I got chatting to one and they actually seemed nice, I would be doubly charmed because of my prejudice that they were going to be a twat. That would show me, wouldn’t it?! Well, I’m not worried – I bet they’re all twats.I’ve never liked buskers and street performers because I’m instinctively very anti-fun. Group fun, that is. The social totalitarianism of the organised, collective, forcedly inclusive fun activity has always made me come over all nervous and contrarian. I don’t mind private fun, and I’m not just talking about masturbation – it could be as simple as reading a book while eating a club sandwich, a long evening of drinking with three or four people who hold exactly the same opinions as you, or watching a Poirot you’ve only seen twice. That’s all great, but group fun, and I’m not just talking about orgies, makes me sneer.And those Edinburgh fringe or Covent Garden buskers and street performers completely tap into that. Surrounded by thick semi-circles of smiling tourists, everyone having a brilliant time because they’re all “up for” the same thing, they make me shudder. “Is the whole world to be turned into a disco?!” I want to shout. “Stop joining in, you big group, and go back to singly joining in with my approved urban activity of scuttling along the streets, eyes glued to the pavements to look out for dog shit.”That’s probably why I don’t mind unsuccessful buskers so much. The ones on their own in a tube station corridor, mournfully strumming Oasis next to some 2ps, provide a much more relaxing aesthetic, in my view. And these are only aesthetic preferences I’m expressing, I should probably clarify. I don’t like buskers in the same way I don’t like barn conversions and herbal tea and The X Factor. I don’t actually think they should be\u0026nbspbanned.But that’s only because I’m an incredibly nice guy, let me add, because they’ve really pushed me to the limit. Over my many years of taking loss-making comedy shows up to Edinburgh, the buskers and street performers of the Royal Mile were a stinging rebuke. Every hungover morning, as I slunk along trying to give out flyers, the bored coughing of the dozen punters who’d watched me bleat clever-clever attempts at wordplay on the previous afternoon still ringing in my ears, the buskers would be there. And the jugglers and sword-swallowers and magicians – all surrounded by adoring throngs.So vast were the crowds they drew, I could seldom get close enough to hear what they said between songs or feats, but I could hear the laughs they got, and then the “oohs” and then the applause. “And they haven’t even hired an incredibly expensive and hot room to perform in!” I fulminated (a small venue at the Edinburgh fringe will, as a result of the cumulative body heat of the audiences and performers occupying it for 14 hours in every 24, reach a temperature roughly halfway between that of a sauna and what Delia Smith describes as “a cool\u0026nbspoven”).“They’ve just made an impromptu theatre out of a pedestrianised bit of street and everyone is loving it because it’s free! So much so that they’re going to express their appreciation for its freeness by paying! It’s like the direct inverse of asking for your money back!”And through the green envious mist – and I’m not just talking about the Scottish weather – I could clearly perceive the performers’ enjoyment of the attention and their success, a very tough thing for a mean-spirited person like me to endure. Really, I should sue for being put through that.So the news that these guys are now edging out of the cash economy is peachily annoying. The fact that they relied on cash was one of the few things I’d previously have said in their favour. It feels like my enemy and my enemy’s enemy have just made friends.Much more than I dislike buskers, I hate the way the superficial convenience of contactless payments, to both purchaser and vendor, is luring us into thoughtlessly accepting the end of cash as the fundamental form of money. If we get to the point where hardly anyone uses it, it will soon cease to be usable. That would bring an end to the most ancient and convenient means we have of anonymously buying, selling and giving.Suddenly all of our payments would be traceable, and stoppable, by governments and credit providers. All access to the numbers in a computer denoting how well off we are will be completely dependent on the competence and goodwill of large, deeply flawed organisations. Maybe it’s inevitable, maybe it’s even broadly for the best, but it shouldn’t happen without an enormous amount of public scrutiny. And when buskers start going contactless, it feels like that’s not happening.On the plus side, the traceable nature of the payments will presumably make it harder for those guitar-playing hippies to completely avoid tax. So well done, the authorities – they’re certainly getting to grips with that issue. Admittedly, Amazon, Google, Apple and the non-doms still represent a challenge, but we’re really cracking down on the street performer sector of the economy. Screwing a bit more out of travelling players will have a powerful “trickle-up” effect that will surely benefit us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8610cdb217ba86a4832a393c428cd0a47e2a36e5/0_2_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d58316156fb9f4561b05debaa72f1706","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of soar","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘soar’The closing date is Wednesday 8 August at 10am.

But how much difference the package will make is unclear.Dairy farmer Ashley Gamble, from near Toowoomba in Queensland, is frightened about the future.He said $12,000 might put food on the table for his children, but would go nowhere on the farm because it was less than the cost of a load of grain or hay.“I wouldn’t wish this on anyone,” Gamble told the Nine Network on Sunday. “It’s like you are in jail every day. You turn up here because you’ve got to turn up. It’s just depressing.”Turnbull defended the figure, promising to monitor the situation given grave forecasts of drought continuing through spring and summer.“We are dealing with a dynamic situation. There’s no set and forget here,” Turnbull said.Eligible farmers will receive the first payment on 1 September, with another round of funding to flow on 1 March next year.The FHA allows farmers to access a payment equivalent to the unemployment benefit, worth about $16,000 a year.The extra relief payment will allow couples to get up to $12,000, while singles will be able to access up to $7,200.Turnbull said long-term measures to improve the resilience of rural communities to handle drought conditions were in the works.As part of the government’s package, struggling farmers will no longer have to trek to town for counselling appointments under new measures to make seeking mental health support easier.Turnbull announced the change on Sunday, along with $11.4m in funding for other initiatives supporting the mental wellbeing of farming families and their communities.Instead of three out of 10 Medicare-supported psychological consultations needing to be in person, rural people can now access all of them over the phone or through Skype under the changes.Turnbull said the government recognises the dry conditions have been taking a mental toll on farming communities. “These are bleak times and a lot of people find it very hard to cope,” he said. “A lot of people don’t want to go into town, they don’t have the time to go into town, they’re shy about doing so.” Eligible drought-affected communities will be able to apply for grants up to $1m to run mental health programs tailored to their needs. It is expected that communities will receive between $200,000 and $300,000 each. Primary Health Networks will also get some of the money to help them cope with increasing demand for their mental health services.Youth mental health organisation ReachOut will be funded to visit drought-affected communities to make young people more aware of their e-counselling services.The initiatives have been embraced by the National Farmers’ Federation. “It’s vital that we help farmers and families that are dealing with the stress and pressures drought brings,” the NFF president, Fiona Simson, said in a statement.Labor welcomed the drought relief package, but called on the government to ensure farmers seeking assistance could contact and access Centrelink.Last week, Labor announced a policy to use agriculture-based research and development corporations to prepare farmers for future droughts.On Sunday Queensland cabinet minister Kate Jones told reporters the federal government’s package would be welcome relief for those in the state battling the drought and the announcement was an example of the Coalition “finally listening to the needs of Australia”.• In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Now, a new crop of beauty bloggers in their 60s and 70s are getting behind their laptop cameras to share the beauty hacks that work for them. Fighting the stereotypes of being seen as “old ladies”, they’re demanding the attention that the beauty industry has denied them.I decided to take on the beauty industry as a political act. It might sound grandiose but I’ve always loved make-up and in my 60s I felt angry with the industry and wanted to disrupt it. Casual ageism is rife. I was gobsmacked when Dior announced that Cara Delevingne was going to be the face of their new anti-ageing products. She’s 25. The outrage should have been loud but hardly anyone batted an eyelid. The industry language of “anti-ageing” is profoundly insulting. Adding that phrase to any product tells me, as a woman who is 70, that I must do everything in my power to stop this natural process.I started getting involved in beauty in my 60s when I noticed a lot of changes happening to my face. Take my eyes. Because bones shrink as you age, my eye sockets got deeper the skin on my eyelids became crêpe-y and my eyebrows became less prominent. I kept trying different products to adapt to the changes and spent money on good stuff because I thought it would be better, but so much turned out to be a waste. At no point was anyone from the beauty industry telling me what would work better on my older skin. They don’t want to show their products on a face that’s less than perfect.My most popular video is about eye and lip make-up for older women, and it has had more than 2m views. The products and techniques younger bloggers use just don’t work the same for older women. The beauty industry, like the fashion industry, designs for the perfect form – young skin. With older skin, you’ve got a loss of melanin that makes features fade, skin becomes dryer and make-up bleeds and doesn’t last as long. There’s a fashion at the moment for a feline flick with a dark, heavy line. If you tried a strong, straight line using a gel eyeliner on my eyelids, it would look ragged and messy.But as older women, we don’t have to follow what the young ones are doing. In my videos and with my products I suggest not trying to get a perfect black line. Instead, use a dark powder eyeshadow and push it into the base of the eyelashes with a tiny wedge brush, making it slightly smudgy. It looks lovely and is a real solution to the problem.Wearing make-up, for me, is about feeling able to face the day, not about looking younger. I like to wear nice clothes, do my hair, put my face on and feel the very best version of me that I can create. I love the transformation that make-up creates and I’m not ashamed to say it.Make-up is so much better quality and more fun than it used to be. When I was young, we didn’t have highlighters, bronzers and contouring. There was just lipstick and powder. I love to mix my make-up and browse the beauty shops that young people go to. I hate feeling forced to be old-lady like.A year ago, my granddaughter started to worry about me getting dementia because most of my older friends had started to. She wanted to keep me busy. So she quit her job and took me to Australia and we started making videos and posting them on YouTube as korea_grandma.The most popular videos have been my make-up tutorials. The first one was me getting ready for a visit to the dentist. I used a cheap lipstick that cost 1,000 won (about 70p) and a very old technique to curl my eyelashes where you heat a toothpick with a lighter and press it against the hairs. It’s very different to what young women do these days. The video has had more than 2m views and it made me well known online in Korea.In Korea, old women perm their hair, wear old people’s clothes and limit make-up to the basics. But it’s other old people that demand we stay that way, not young people.Because of YouTube, my life has turned around completely. I’ve seen so much of the world, been kayaking, eaten the most expensive food in Korea. Unfortunately my friends don’t even know how to get on YouTube so they don’t watch my videos. I like to watch younger people’s YouTube channels and get inspired. Sometimes I miss my younger days. I’ve continued making the videos because they make me happy. It’s just me being myself and having fun. People have stereotypes of how “old people” should do their make-up, but my make-up is far from that. And what I’m doing is giving other women courage to do what they want.youtubekorea_grandmaBack in 2013, I was watching some younger people’s vlogs on YouTube and when they talked about beauty I thought, “Well, gosh, I’ve been wearing make-up for 50 years, I’ve got a lot of experience, too. I wonder if I could do that.” I sat down in my son’s old bedroom and filmed myself. Then I researched how to upload a video. Two people watched it. But I didn’t care – I just kept going. I’ve now got 70,000 subscribers to Melissa55.I didn’t necessarily feel I had anything to offer anyone else. I’m an average person. Like so many other women in America, I got married, raised children, haven’t had a big career – but I did want to show that you can still feel good about yourself when you’re elderly. My generation’s not ageing like our mothers did – we wear jeans with holes in them and keep our hair long or go grey if we want.Over the last few years, more people have been searching online for videos of women over 50 doing make-up, and that’s really helped me and other older beauty vloggers to grow. My top make-up tip is to visit a beauty store and have a free makeover to find the right foundation for your skin type – it’s the base for everything else. I use a Laura Mercier oil-free one that gives me a glow. I’ve stopped applying powder altogether. For cleaning my face, I find regular terry washcloths too harsh, so I knit my own for the perfect texture. Skincare’s always been important to me and since my 30s I’ve used Retin A from my dermatologist.I’m friends with other older vloggers and we all buy the newest technology. We’ve learned how to edit nicely, add music, set up lighting. It takes time to do it well. We do get comments like, “You old hag, why don’t you get off YouTube?” But we continue to fight to be heard.It’s hard being an older woman in society in general. Much of our lives we did our duty and mattered to our children and it can be a challenge to feel relevant. Advertisers don’t recognise us. When we look at the TV or at models, we don’t recognise those girls. It bothered me when Estée Lauder used Kendall Jenner to advertise wrinkle cream when she doesn’t have a wrinkle on her.Most of my audience is women my age. I’ve become close friends with many of them and that kinship is part of the reason I make the videos. There’s a group of us that met online and talk every day. We lift and support each other, whether it’s problems with kids or health or husbands, or just feelings about getting older. It means everything to me.My children don’t really like me doing beauty vlogging but they’ve learned to accept it. If you have the right attitude about it, this is a time in your life where you feel a lot of freedom to try new things.youtubevolmel55I started my YouTube channel because I couldn’t find many people reviewing wigs for hair loss. Lots of younger women were reviewing wigs for fashion, but I didn’t see anyone else going through all the heartache and pain of losing their hair and turning to wigs as a necessity. When I started, my two children were like, “Mum, are you really going to be on YouTube with your bald head and no make-up?” I thought, “Yes, because you don’t see it and we need to be represented.” It shouldn’t be anything to be ashamed of. It happens. People lose their hair, especially women of colour.My hair loss began in my late 30s. Then when my son went through chemotherapy aged 15 for cancer, I cut my hair off too, so that he could feel more comfortable. With the stress of his chemo, plus just ageing, and years of wearing weave and braids, my hair didn’t really grow back. But I decided I wanted to be an example to others that you can get through it. I received so many emails from women, men, even young children, who thanked me for being out there. Even though my channel wasn’t drawing the masses, I was helping others.My subscribers started asking if I could do make-up for bald women and older women. For example when you wear a wig, you can’t put make-up on parts of your forehead because it stops the wig sticking. You also have to think about how bright you want your make-up to be, depending on the wig’s colour and style.My channel now focuses on beauty for older women and is called Ageless Beauty. I use the term pro-ageing rather than anti-ageing, because I’m not trying not to age. For me it’s about skin and hydration. I’ve been using Ambi Skincare every day for over 30 years and that’s kept the elasticity in my skin. When I went through the menopause I shared tips like putting powder on before foundation to help prevent make-up melting when you’re having hot flashes. Although sometimes nothing can stop it.It takes a lot of courage to remove your hair and make-up and put yourself on YouTube to be judged and criticised. There are days when I don’t want to turn the camera on, but by the time I’ve finished the video I’m pumped up. Make-up and hair can change how you feel and get you out of a funk, and I love showing that.For four years, I pretended I was 59. I just didn’t want to embrace that 60-year-old milestone. I’d worked at Microsoft for a long time and it’s a young culture. While I felt vibrant, I was afraid that other people would view me differently.Then when I was 64, I was on holiday and had a nasty fall. I was in bed for five days and it gave me time to think. I realised I’d fallen because I wasn’t connected to my body and to the real me. It was time to accept that I had to look after myself, physically and emotionally, to let the old me go. I knew there had to be other women holding back from making that leap into 60. From that bed, I launched Sixty and Me via Facebook.It took off immediately. I work with my son and his wife and we produce content for women over 60. From listening to the community, we saw older women feeling invisible in society. People see them differently and when they look in the mirror, they see themselves differently. The beauty articles I write and videos I make address this.I like to empower women and pull them into our shared experience. I’ll look into the camera and say, “I wouldn’t worry too much about us having wrinkles under our eyes, because that’s just what happens when we turn 60, right?” My beauty videos are about simple things. For example, I don’t use concealer to erase the lines around my eyes any more – what’s the point? It can’t do it. But I do use it to mask shadows when I haven’t had enough sleep. If you apply it quite low, almost above your cheekbone, it reflects back up to your eye and hides the darkness.A lot of women in their 60s are dealing with a reinvention that s relationships, family and work. In my late 50s I went through a orce and in the 2008 financial crash I lost my house and savings. Many older women are also very creative. My approach to make-up is: “Just try it.” You see the years ticking and you know there’s less ahead than there is behind, and this is a time to really express your true nature. When people say they want to age gracefully, I think, “How about magnificently? Or creatively?” Pink hair. That’s what I’m trying next.Now when people ask me how old I am and I say almost 70, they stop and say, “Oh wow, you don’t look it.” Remembering Gloria Steinem’s quote, I reply, “This is what 70 looks like.”sixtyandme This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

She had a string of romances with beautiful, troubled men. Further boxes are ticked on the biopic checklist by the fact that she struggled with demons – heroin was her drug of choice.But Nico, 1988, the daringly unconventional biopic by Italian director Susanna Nicchiarelli, which has just opened in the US, is not about the singer in her iconic phase. Instead it deals with the last two years of her life: Nico prefers to go by her birth name, Christa Päffgen she performs avant-garde proto-goth dirges while scowling through her fringe in European e bars the decades of addiction have taken their toll, but she doesn’t care: “I wasn’t happy when I was beautiful.”Nico’s value to Warhol was inextricably linked to the way she looked. When asked what became of Nico after she left his studio, the Factory, Warhol was dismissive: “She became a fat junkie and disappeared.” But what interested Nicchiarelli was her resilience. Unlike other Warhol superstars – such as Edie Sedgwick and Candy Darling – who crashed and burned once their 15 minutes of fame were snatched away, Nico reclaimed herself. Talking at the Rotterdam film festival, Nicchiarelli said, “The intriguing thing about Nico was that she survived. She was so much stronger.”The focus of this film – on unglamorous middle age rather than gilded youth – is significant. It is representative of a change in the way biopics – for so long dominated by white, male stories – approach female subjects. There’s no doubt that we are in the midst of a particularly rich period for female-led real-life dramas. Alongside independent productions such as Nico, 1988 and Christine (about TV news anchor Christine Chubbuck), Hollywood has also got in on the act. The last 18 months have seen the release of studio productions such as I, Tonya, Battle of the Sexes, Molly’s Game, Queen of Katwe and Hidden Figures.It’s tempting to assume that this wealth of female-led biopics represents a surge in the number of films about women that have been produced. A look forward to the coming award season certainly seems to back that up. Forthcoming female biopics include those of two writers, two queens, a spy, a wrestler and a US Supreme Court Justice.But statistics tell a different story. Just last week, the University of South California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which analyses the representation of women, along with people of colour, LGBT characters and characters with disability in cinema, released a study entitled Inequality in 1,100 Popular Films, which covers the top 100 movies each year from 2007 through to 2017 and shows no significant statistical improvement in the representation of women. Study co-author Katherine Pieper attributes the impression that there are more female-led films than there actually are to “the availability heuristic”. This, she says, is “the tendency of people to overestimate the occurrence of a particular item because of examples that easily come to mind”.But there is something else at play. What is harder to define, but does seem like a genuinely positive trend, is a shift in the narratives of female-led biopics, a change in the kind of stories that get told. Previously, the main criterion for biopic treatment seemed to be a set of male genitalia, and failing that, royal blood or a singing career. The Hollywood approach suggested that women’s stories were more valuable if youth and beauty were key plot points. And for some reason, doomed and tragic tended to be an easier sell to financiers than difficult and complex.Now, bad behaviour is not just permitted, it’s positively encouraged. Last year saw Molly’s Game showcase poker queen and FBI target Molly Bloom, while I, Tonya got under the sequined Lycra of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding. Flawed female characters continue to exert a fascination. This autumn will see Can You Ever Forgive Me?, starring Melissa McCarthy, which tells of American author turned literary forger and thief Lee\u0026nbspIsrael. And Red Joan, starring Judi Dench, is inspired by the life of the KGB’s longest-serving British spy, Melita Norwood.Female biopics are not shying away from racial and sexual politics. Hidden Figures, which explored the role of a team of female African American mathematicians in the Nasa space programme, was hugely\u0026nbspsuccessful. And Mimi Leder’s On The Basis Of Sex, about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, her struggles for equal rights and her journey to become a US supreme court justice, is already tipped for the awards circuit this year.Although suspicious of the subjective nature of biopics and their often stodgy approach, Mia Bays, director-at-large of Birds’ Eye View, which campaigns for gender equality in film, concurs. “It seems the net has been cast a little wider of late and the biopic is no longer the preserve of the damaged musician and royalty,” she says. “The 1970s appears to be a recurring period in terms of female-led biopics, and may say more about the times we are living in now – as the fourth wave of feminism surges, we look back to an earlier age for answers.”While cinema is notoriously slow to react to social movements, it’s hard not to view the new wave of female-led biopics through the lens of the post-#MeToo era. There is a fresh awareness not only of the treatment of women within the film industry but also of the telling of their stories. The term “inclusion rider” (a contract term requiring ersity in cast and crew) has\u0026nbspentered industry consciousness, and lobbying groups such as Era 5050 and Women and Hollywood are calling for equal representation for women in front of and behind the camera.While we are yet to see what effect this all has on the films that get made, it has certainly had an effect on the audience reaction to them. Bays says: “We need to keep up the pressure to tell more women’s stories as there’s a hunger out there for them – we hear and see it every day in our work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd78c31ac7813846bc1b3874d7ee833d4627bf3/0_193_2344_1406/master/2344.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82af650ea731dbdbdd8b747ce55d68d","title":"premier league 2018 19 fans previews part 1 arsenal to huddersfield","story":"Fans have their say on key players, weak links and summer spending – and make their predictions for the season ahead Gooner excitement levels are at fever pitch. Optimism abounds, since at the very least we know we’re in for a fascinating ride. Even if a title challenge proves beyond us, so long as we’re capable of competing with the best and Unai can achieve a more consistent, hungrier-looking Arsenal that can restore the natural order of things – a top-four finish above our noisy neighbours – our new leader will have more than sated the Gooner faithful.Key menweak links Can Torreira consistently reproduce the same garra charrua tenacity witnessed in Russia and, crucially, will Leno establish himself as our No 1? Losing Ramsey, after both Wilshere and Cazorla have made their exits, could leave us somewhat bereft of midfield creativity.

First manager sacked: Claude Puel (Leicester). Bernard Azulay, GoonersDiary, @GoonerN5I’m not confident the Cherries will improve on last season when we finished a respectable 12th. The team need to be able to produce more clean sheets and in buying just one new defender I’m not sure we’ll have tightened up enough in that area.Key menweak links Aké will again be the rock on which the defence is built and our hopes are that Lewis Cook has an even better season. We’ll hope to see more of Jack Simpson as well at centre-back, but he could be limited to cup games. A centre-back and a strong ball-winning central midfielder would be ideal additions and Colombia’s Jefferson Lerma is set to come in for a club record £25m from Levante.Headline maker I expect all the focus will be on our new £10m signing Brooks, if he gets some starts. He is only 21 and he has been really impressive in pre-season, so we are hoping for big things from him.Predictions: We will finish: 14th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Arsenal 4. Tottenham.

Peter Bell, afcbchimes.blogspot, @CherryChimesAfter an unbelievable summer in the transfer market another season in the Premier League is just so exciting with nine major signings. The battle with Leicester to land Jahanbakhsh, last season’s Ereisie top scorer and our record signing, had the whole city on tenterhooks. Chris Hughton is just the manager to get the new players to gel.Key menweak links So many key players! Dunk and Duffy were monsters in defence last season and will surely be even stronger with our first Brazilian Bernado alongside them. Gröss will be a huge influence again with Stephens and Bissouma in a magical midfield. And we finally signed a top striker in Andone. A weak link? Southern Rail’s hopeless train service to the Amex.Headline maker Our recruitment dept led by Paul Winstanley with the backing of Paul Barber and Tony Bloom – chairman, local hero and lifelong fan. They have done wonders this summer.Predictions: We will finish: 9th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Chelsea 4. Arsenal. Bottom three: 18. Crystal Palace 19. Watford 20. Cardiff Promoted: Aston Villa, West Brom and Brentford. First manager sacked: Mourinho (Man Utd). Steph Fincham, Observer reader Having enjoyed such a good 2017-18 season there is every cause for optimism looking ahead to the new season. We keep on improving season by season, although I suppose it will be difficult to get any higher than last season’s seventh place. A similar season with a really good cup run would be excellent, even more so if that cup run comes in the Europa League.Key menweak links It’s always a team game at Burnley but, as always, it’s goals that win games and so our strikers will be key players. I wrote a year ago that we were a central defender down and we still are. I’d like a new central defender, a wide player and a forward.Headline maker We don’t do controversies, rows and bust-ups, certainly not publicly. It’s a well run club where the headlines come from the performances. Sean Dyche, as ever, will get plenty of attention and his press conferences get better and better.Predictions: We will finish: 10th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Man Utd.

Tony Scholes, UpTheClarets, @UTCdotcomAfter the disastrous Premier League adventure in 2013-14 I’m expecting a much more united front. With Warnock in charge you know your team is going to give plenty of effort and with the fans fully back on board I’m confident we can avoid the bottom three.Key menweak links Cardiff have signed two exciting attacking players. Murphy and Reid. They will enhance the club but I think the key players are going to be defenders Morrison and Bamba. Both were heroes during promotion. They could be the difference as we will rely on not conceding goals as much as scoring them. We lack proper Premier League experience in midfield and attack. Headline maker Warnock will be in his element in front of the press and won’t disappoint in interviews. He had a run-in with the Wolves manager last season and is never short of a word or two if he feels things are not going his way.Predictions: We will finish: 15th. Top four: 1. Man City 2.

Michael Morris, cardiffcity-mad, @cardiffcitymadIn short – who knows? We’re told the chain-smoking ex-banker will deliver beautiful expansive football. We’ll apparently see mesmeric super-fast one-touch football – whether the likes of Victor Moses are capable of such wizardry is yet to be established. In all seriousness, it’s always difficult to really make much out of pre-season exploits but the team do seem to be picking up the Sarriball ethos pretty quickly. Key menweak links As long as he is at Chelsea, Hazard will continue to be the jewel in our crown. Weaknesses? Do I have to say it again? Victor Moses. We also need a striker, probably two given Morata seems to prefer Instagram to playing football. And if Courtois goes then the goalkeeping pool is not looking healthy, not healthy at allHeadline maker Sarri does have previous for this sort of thing. He’s not really one who watches what he says or how he says it. Predictions: We will finish: 3rd. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Chelsea 4. Man Utd. Bottom three: 18. Cardiff 19. Huddersfield 20 Newcastle. Promoted: West Brom, Stoke, Derby. First manager sacked: Benítez (Newcastle). Trizia Fiorellino, ChelseaSupportersGroup.net A decent start to the season would be nice for a change! We appear to have replaced Cabaye and Loftus-Cheek and strengthened in key areas. I see no reason, barring injuries, why a top-half finish isn’t achievable Key menweak links Keeping hold of Zaha has, of course, been key. Tomkins and Sakho formed a formidable partnership in the centre of defence and much will be expected of them. The signing of Meyer is intriguing can he deliver on the hype? Benteke needs to hit form again this campaign or we will once again be weak up front.Headline maker Zaha will obviously be linked to every top club every single week I think we will have him for one more season before we will need to let him achieve greater things. I suspect there will be a lot of talk about potential new owners at the club too as the season unfolds.Predictions: We will finish: 10th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Brighton 19. Cardiff 20. Huddersfield Promoted: West Brom, Derby, Middlesbrough. First manager sacked: Mourinho (Man Utd). Chris Waters, PalaceTrust.org.uk, @Clapham_GrandI’m always optimistic. With a new manager, Marco Silva, a new set-up, a few new players, hopefully we’ll get off to a good start. I think we’ll score goals but I’m a little worried about the centre of our defence. Key menweak links The key players in what is likely to be Silva’s 4-3-3 are definitely going to be Richarlison and Tosun up front. So much depends on those two for goals. Kieran Dowell, who spent last season on loan at Nottingham Forest, is the youngster who needs to impress – he’s got the skill, he just needs to perform on the pitch. But the central defence needs fixing. Keane is slow to react and Jags is no spring chicken.Headline maker I think Tom Davies has all the tools – he was seen playing football in the street late at night with his mates. The young midfielder has also been known to ride his skateboard in the city centre.Predictions: We will finish: 7th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Arsenal 3. Man Utd 4. Chelsea. Bottom three: 18. Newcastle 19. Watford 20. Cardiff. Promoted: Stoke, West Brom, Blackburn. First manager sacked: Javi Gracia (Watford) Steve Jones, @BlueKippercomWe’re back! And hoping to do more than just make up the numbers. Thanks, Slav, for masterminding our return to the top flight. If we’re not overawed, and can tap into the confidence gained from going 23 matches unbeaten plus the uplift from our play-off exploits, our possession-based football might surprise a few teams.Key menweak links Seems the powers-that-be have woken up to the fact that the season starts in August, not midwinter. After two campaigns of playing catch-up, we’ve bolstered the squad early: Fabri, Le Marchand, Mawson, Seri, Schürrle and the returning Mitrovic are the done deals with one or two others still bubbling under.Headline maker Mitro’s comments on signing a five-year contract suggest he’s determined to carry on from where he left off as a loanee: “This is a big club and last year we made history. We want to keep making big things.” Predictions: We will finish: 12th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Man Utd Bottom three: 18. Huddersfield 19. Watford 20 Cardiff. Promoted: West Brom, Middlesbrough, Derby. First manager sacked: Neil Warnock (Cardiff). David Lloyd, toofif The last two years under David Wagner – promotion followed by survival – have given us Huddersfield Town fans every reason to be optimistic, no matter the odds. However, I have a feeling this year is going to be very tough … Key menweak links The permanent signing of Kongolo from Monaco was something of a coup for us – he was a rock during his six-month loan spell and I’m surprised no one usurped the deal. If Pritchard can fulfil his potential, he will have a real impact. In terms of weaknesses, I was hoping we’d bring in a more dynamic striker to freshen our options up top.Headline maker Wagner is well liked by the press and is always good value for a soundbite. Zanka is a real character, as seen by his generous buying of pints for all away fans travelling to St Mary’s last Christmas.Predictions: We will finish: 18th. Top four: 1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3.

The weather has unplugged us. The whole of Britain has become the . If it hadn’t rained last week, there was a very real threat that we would have started eating each other. Something switched, about a fortnight into the heatwave, when half the country’s relationships had ended purely because sharing a bed with another clammy body was no longer viable as a lifestyle choice and a series of sleepless nights had led to a whole nation walking round as red-eyed and glutinous-minded as new parents. Something switched and, collectively, we lost it. I shared a rush-hour train with a topless businessman. He made eye contact only with the model in the hair-loss ad. Everywhere, the smell of beer and meat.Children cried for three weeks solid, the sound of ice-cream vans a glorious tinnitus. Clothes had not been invented that could keep us cool, and also contain these bodies that we were suddenly aware of having to carry around with us like InterRailing rucksacks. Why couldn’t we just be minds in this heat, brains, riding around in plastic domes on top of clever dogs? Why must we heave around all these idiot limbs, all this hair? The heat made us think of ourselves in the third person, a character that must be manoeuvred from home to work without hurting anybody. It messed with our ethics, our body odour. Two drinks in, complete strangers were snogging against lampposts, then it got hotter, and even sex people stopped having sex. Seen from above, our green and pleasant land appeared yellow and mean.At a park I saw a woman who had taken her shoes off and thrown them in a lake. Walking along the seafront, the beach to the right of me sprinkled with McFlurrys, I saw a boy start a fight with a seagull. Inevitably, all conversations began drifting towards global warming, whether they started at Love Island or cancer, except it was too hot to remember the facts, so across Britain bubbles of doom floated from our mouths, popping listlessly above us with words such as “problem”. Sleeping with the windows open led to vivid dreams, and vivid dreams led to people telling each other their vivid dreams, which led to ruinous fractures in many office friendships and also unwanted insights into each other’s desires. My cat, her body spilled across a tiled floor, looked confused. Every evening I’d brush a fistful of hair from her back while she bit at my finger, apologetic. Then one day, people started talking about rain.Conversations about weather were no longer small talk. There was competitive sharing of information from apps, one saying the heat was going to continue until Sunday, another saying to expect highs of 35C – on the news things spontaneously caught fire. The first yearnings for rain were phrased as jokes, the second were more pleading and the third were almost violent in their intensity. The people wanted a referendum for rain, they deserved a say. Clicking frantically through Screwfix, Amazon, Currys and Argos, I discovered electric fans had sold out across the country – stockpiling had begun. I was in a Wagamama at a leisure centre when it came, the rain, but the smell arrived first, like a carrier bag of 2ps left on the hob. In the car park, a fully grown adult danced round a tree with his takeaway, Nando’s own Gene Kelly. Girls were screaming outside the bowling alley. My washing needed rewashing.Even after the heat broke, we continued our descent into madness, arguing about the meaning of breezes, disoriented by the concept of “jackets”. Yes the plants looked healthier, but our heads were still dehydrated, brains the consistency of space food. It was July but comedians welcomed winter, and all your worst cousins stage-whispered on social media about how they were putting the heating on. After two days of modest rain and pale skies, the heat had been completely forgotten and everybody was back in bad moods and denim. This is part of the madness, our inability to recall the feeling of standing in sunshine, of sweat pooling at the base of our backs. When we rolled over one morning to damply glug deeply from last week’s stale glass of water, and discovered summer had returned, the shock was real.The cycle began again, the delight, the complaints, the man with skin like a tree shouting “legs” at schoolgirls outside the post office. The narrowing of eyes at neighbours’ hosepipes, the affairs that began largely because hotels are air-conditioned, the elaborate Home Alone-style contraptions designed not to maim burglars but instead to cool a bedroom, the emergence of belly buttons and other things everyone had forgotten existed. The weather is giving us madness, both from the way it screws with our bodies and routines, and from the way it pushes us right to the edge, then walks away whistling. The weather is the only thing that the whole of Britain really shares, and we don’t know what to do with that.Best takeaway from Love Island: Dani Dyer calls her grandad ‘bruv’ and Danny Dyer calls his daughter ‘mate’. This is what we call ‘relationship goals’.In Gordon Ramsay’s new show he will ‘attempt to beat some of the best chefs from around the world at their own cuisine.’ Oh darling, no. Saying that though, I’d definitely tune in to see him rustle up a Friday night dinner, the gefilte fish, the kneidlach, chopped liver, challah, in order to ‘beat’ a room of Jewish grandmas, if only to see his haunted face as he left. With two carrier bags of cling-filmed leftovers, of course.Last week, I called the police after following a guy escaping from a crime scene. He got into a car, and I started chanting the number plate to myself as I dialled 999 so as not to forget it. I was on the line for six minutes before I got through.

Or at least don’t allow him to impinge on you when he happens to be aroundThe dilemma I dated my sister’s husband’s best friend 12 years ago. At the end of our relationship, he became physically, verbally and emotionally abusive. He has refused to speak to my sister and her husband for years at a time because they are friends with me, but on the two occasions I moved to a different city, he found a way back into their lives and they allowed it. I reached out to him to try and coexist in the same friend group. He refused and has made every joint social situation awkward and painful for me and my fiancé. We have lost invites because he refuses to be in the same place as us and he has ruined other events due to his immature antics. My sister and her husband believe I am the problem because this guy is still mad at me for breaking up with him 12 years ago. I want a relationship with my sister and her husband but I’m frustrated at their victim blaming, disregard of my feelings (which I have expressed to them tirelessly), and the continued excusing of his abusive behaviour 12 years ago.Mariella replies What a creep. It sounds like you made an excellent choice back then and you should feel pleased about it today. The fact that he’s so closely linked to your sister is a complication but it doesn’t have to remain an ongoing battle. I’m sure if we sat down together over a coffee you’d be able to present me with some unpleasant examples of this man’s actions at the time, and his continuing isive behaviour that would provide compelling reasons for friends and family to shut him, rather than you, out of their social soirées.When it comes to romance there are two sides to every single story and while that doesn’t exonerate the badly behaved, it can be a challenge to get others to see the situation through our eyes. It’s one of the reasons so many serial abusers get away with their dysfunctional deeds – because they are able to cover up their real characters with a tsunami of charm that deludes those around them and isolates their victims.But the word abuse is a loaded one today and where it once bore shades of grey, today it immediately blackens the name of the accused. So I have to ask you to be honest with yourself and decide whether we are talking about real abuse here, or a short-lived aberration a very long time ago. We must be very careful about the language we use to describe what are now crimes, for the sake of those still suffering. Employing wisdom and responsibility when it comes to sexual politics and matters of the heart is the only way to ensure that real victims are believed and their abusers dealt with.You’re not writing to ask me what you should do about his behaviour then, but about how to lead parallel lives now without it causing too much discomfort. That leads me to think it’s not his historic behaviour you are concerned with but your own sense of injustice and frustration at his seeming refusal to normalise relations. Twelve years is a long time for wounds to fester and it’s a different climate now, and his actions would be judged harshly. I assume you decided to simply move on and pursue a better union. If that’s the case, then you need to live up to that decision.If his behaviour was serious, it’s not your sister and her friend who should be judging him but a court of law. There are plenty of professional organisations who can advise you on overcoming and then pursuing your abuser if that’s the path you feel you need to take (Refuge, for example, is on 0808 2000 247).My advice, were we poring over the embers back in the day, might well have been to pursue a more litigative path but you have moved on and I think you need to do so emotionally as well as literally. You’re right for wanting to develop an entente but I wonder how much you’re invested in achieving it. Your sister, her husband and his best friend are not going to change. Accepting that is a non-negotiable requirement for changing the current dynamic. Twelve years later, it’s safe to assume that they aren’t suddenly going to find his past behaviour abhorrent.At the moment it sounds like the two of you are involved in a tussle for social supremacy. Maybe it’s time to truly erase him from your life – something you can achieve all on your own. Your sister and her husband need to be free to continue their friendship and you need to stop making this ex a topic of conversation. We all have the capacity for emotional masochism and also to become deeply invested in situations where the far better solution is to cut yourself free of emotional connections. You had a bad affair and if the only punishment he deserves is banishment from your sister and brother-in-laws’ lives, then I have to conclude he’s not a monster.Maintain a relationship with your sister and don’t allow him to impinge on you when he happens to be around. There’s a great freedom to be had when you simply stop allowing him to aggravate you. We are sophisticated creatures so give emotional erasure a go – you don’t want to be churning over the same ground in decades to come.

Most of my favourites are sleeping quietly in their storage jars in the cupboard: the varieties that hold sauce in their nooks and crannies the wide, beefy ribbons of pappardelle that tangle their way through a ragu sauce, and the sheets of dried lasagne, which have been in their box all summer.When the weather is warm I prefer the tiny beads of fregola, like little pills in shades of brown and cream, or orzo, or the fine, thinnest of noodles. Sauces, if you can call them that, tend to be cooking juices or stocks, or simply olive oil and lemon. There is not a cream sauce in sight.I cooked a pot of fregola, the fat Sardinian couscous, the other night, its nutty colours coming from the fact the little dots of dough are toasted before drying. I then let the drained pasta soak up the cooking juices from a pan of sweet, plump cod cheeks that I had fried briefly in butter and olive oil and tossed with pine kernels, orange and lemon zest and parsley. Like mograbia, the rounder, plumper and untoasted version, the little beads excel in soaking up dressings and cooking juices. They are particularly useful to throw, cooked and drained, into the fat and meat juices left in the roasting tin while the Sunday roast is resting.The cod cheeks were good value – nuggets of juicy fish with snow-white flesh all too often ignored on the fishmonger’s slab. As sweet and chunky as a scallop, they deserve to be used more often. (I could have used pieces of cod fillet, cut into 3-4cm chunks, instead.)I also tweaked an old favourite this week. I have loved summer pudding since the days when I made it throughout the summer for a London restaurant. The delicate nature of the red berries and their soft corset of juice-saturated bread is one of the delights of late summer. I am particularly fond of the recipe when it is beefed up with a splash of fruit-based alcohol, the intensity of blackcurrants rather than purely red fruits, and served hot from the oven, with cream.We ate this light, fresh-tasting summer fish dish warm rather than hot, its flavour somehow even better having rested for 10-15 minutes on the side of the hob. If fregola had proved elusive, I would have used fat beads of mograbia, sometimes sold as giant couscous. Italian grocers shops can usually come up with them.Toast the pine kernels in a dry, shallow pan until golden. A regular shake of the pan will stop them browning unevenly. Bring the vegetable stock to the boil in a deep pan, pour in the fregola and bring back to the boil. Lower the heat and leave to cook for about 15 minutes until tender. Drain and set aside, running a few drops of olive oil through them with a fork to stop the little beads sticking together.Cut both ends from one of the lemons, place the fruit on its end, then slice downwards to remove the peel and white pith. Turn the fruit on its side and cut into 4 or 5 round slices, then cut each slice into 8 small pieces. You want tiny nuggets of lemon throughout the fregola. Repeat with one of the oranges.Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan and add the butter. When the butter melts and is starting to fizz with bubbles, lightly season the cod cheeks and lower into the pan. Fry for 3 minutes on each side, turning them with kitchen tongs as necessary, until they are evenly pale gold. Finely grate the reserved orange and set aside, then slice the fruit in half and squeeze it over the cod cheeks. Remove from the heat to a warm dish.Fold the drained fregola through the juices in the pan in which you cooked the fish. Grate the zest from the reserved lemon then fold it through the fregola, together with the reserved orange zest, toasted pine kernels, a little salt and ground pepper, and the chopped parsley.The sloe gin is merely a suggestion. Its inclusion lends a deep, mellow fruitiness to the proceedings. I should add that we ate half of it hot and had the rest the next day, for breakfast, with a ribbon of sheep’s yogurt over it so no one could accuse us having pudding for breakfast.redcurrants and blackcurrants 500graspberries 350gcaster sugar 125g, plus 3 tbspwater 375mlsloe gin 100ml white bread 400g, slicedicing sugar a little to finishPull the currants from their stalks and put them in a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan with the raspberries, caster sugar and water. Place the pan over a moderate heat and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and leave to simmer for 7-10 minutes or until the berries start to burst and the sugar has dissolved. Pour in the sloe gin and remove from the heat.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Remove any chewy crusts from the bread. Leave softer ones in place or cut them off as you wish. Place the bread in a shallow baking dish, approximately 22cm in diameter, arranging the slices uniformly or hugger-mugger as the fancy takes you. Spoon the berries and their juice over the bread, making sure that the bread is completely soaked with purple juice.Scatter 3 tbsp of sugar over the surface and bake for 25 minutes until the juices are bubbling and the top is lightly crisp in places.

The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Added to that, it seems likely that millions are being charged too much for their service.A new push for customers to avoid unnecessary price increases was launched by the communications regulator last week when Ofcom proposed providers be compelled to tell people when they were at the end of their minimum contract period.It is estimated that more than 10\u0026nbspmillion people are on deals where there is an automatic price increase at the end. And since many people don’t switch providers when they are out of contract, they are missing out on the savings.This is an added frustration to the UK consumer – last year it was estimated that more than half of all users are getting a raw deal from their supplier, according to research from consumer group Which?However, faced with the prospect of swapping routers, changing passwords and – if broadband is bundled with TV – possibly losing a backlog of favourite programmes, many are reticent to switch their broadband provider.Broadband contracts are typically offered on periods of 12, 18 or 24 months, during which users cannot leave or face a termination charge. At the end of this period, they are no longer tied to the existing deal and can leave and go to another provider, possibly for a better deal. Ofcom estimates that there are 10\u0026nbspmillion people who are on deals where there is an automatic price increase at the end. However, most providers do not remind people that their contracts are up, meaning that they roll on on a monthly basis with the possibility of an increased price or a change to the parts of the deal.Many people simply are not aware of the status of their contract, according to a report from Ofcom, and do not know what will happen to their bill when the deal does end. Added to that, many do not know the options available to them. “Around one in 10 are unaware that they could switch to a better deal with their current provider once their contract ends,” said a consultation document on end-of-contract\u0026nbspnotifications.The mantra from consumer affairs champions is to switch for better deals – whether that be mobile-phone contracts, bank accounts or insurance providers. However while switching can be relatively smooth in the energy sector, it is not the same with broadband, especially if you have signed up to a bundle which also includes TV.There is a lot of “friction” in switching from TV and broadband, says Dan Howdle from the comparison site Cable. It is not the case that moving from one provider can happen seamlessly in the background, he says, as people have routers, set-top boxes and a home network that may rely on the system that is in place.“There is an emotional attachment to it. If you have a Sky box, your emotional attachment is not to that piece of plastic but the fact that you might have all of your favourite programmes on it for the last year. You might have paid for or bought movies on a service that is on that box. There is that stickiness,” he\u0026nbspsays.Providers increasingly offer deals where services are bundled so that it is a more complex decision to switch, according to Peat. “They know that once they have got you with the TV package, you are unlikely to switch landline and broadband,” he says.“A decision like that is more of a family decision than an inidual decision so you have got to take into account what the kids are watching … and therefore the decision is put off in a way that it would not be put off for mobile because that is much more of a personal service. The added layer of TV services does create inertia in the market.”Ctrlio claims that consumers can see savings of between £180 and £200 a year by switching broadband providers. “Our view is that if you break those services down, there is still the opportunity to make savings because there are good deals on each inidual part of those services. While there is convenience in having the complete package and you will get a discount versus buying all of your parts from one service provider in separate elements, there are better savings to be seen by choosing to switch at the right times with different providers for each,” says Peat.Others are more sceptical that switching broadband provider, if within a package, will result in savings. Howdle says consumers will usually not benefit from splitting up the services and there are a number of instances where even being aware that switching will save money will not provide enough incentive to\u0026nbspmove.“Unfortunately, due to bundling and the money that you save from bundling, that is never going to save you money. The way that the big providers provide all four services – broadband, TV, mobile, home phone – there is a discount at every level,” he said. “You are never going to be better off by separating out your services from different providers.”For those that don’t have that level of “stickiness” that holds them to their provider, switching can be lucrative, via incentives such as cashback or Amazon vouchers, Howdle says.Choosing when to switch is also important, says Peat. Don’t feel that you have to buy a new deal on the day your current contract runs out, as there are certain times of the month when there are better deals available, usually at the end of a three-month quarter.If providers feel that they are going to miss financial targets, they sometimes try to up the number of users of their services to disguise underperformance, says Peat.“So you will see, at the end of quarters, broadband providers in particular offer very aggressive deals to be able to create a headline message to say, ‘OK maybe we did not hit our profit target but we overachieved on the sign-up of customers so this has been a good quarter for us’,” he says. For consumers to take advantage, however, they have to be aware of company timetables and time their switch accordingly, which may involve being on a rolling contract for a few months.• Many consumers are not aware of when their broadband contract ends or what the new charges will be once it does. Find out the date and switch on an alert system on your computer’s calender to remind you when you are free to\u0026nbspswitch.• Providers often reserve their best deals for new customers and to retain old customers. It is possible to negotiate a new deal at the end of an existing one by threatening to leave?• Switching can be laborious as it often involves installing new equipment or changing other services if it is part of a bundled deal. However, there are savings to be made and also incentives, such as cashback deals or Amazon vouchers.• It may sound like a lot of faff, but watching the financial calendars of the broadband companies can result in very good deals. As they near the end of a quarter, some providers will try and bulk up numbers by getting more customers on board with lucrative offers. So time your approach well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83585f7ad1e79f6e19760e9a1ef93f9d4a444e74/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc8c02b6bc6d9aa64e72a9184b3d54eb","title":"liam fox says no deal brexit now more likely than an agreement","story":"UK appears set to crash out of EU due to Brussels ‘intransigence’, says cabinet ministerThe UK appears set to crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal due to the “intransigence” of the Brussels machine, Liam Fox has claimed.The International Trade Secretary put the chances of a no-deal Brexit at “60-40” despite both sides saying they want to reach an agreement on the terms of the UK’s departure from the bloc in March 2019.The prominent Brexiteer said he believed the risk of a no-deal scenario had increased, pinning the blame on the European Commission and Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier.“I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal,” he told the Sunday Times (paywall).“We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it’s a bureaucrats’ Brexit - not a people’s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.”He said Mr Barnier had dismissed the UK’s proposals in the Chequers plan thrashed out by Theresa May and the Cabinet simply because “we have never done it before”.The Government has admitted its proposals are unprecedented, but Dr Fox said Mr Barnier’s response “makes the chance of no deal greater”.The Prime Minister held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, cutting short her holiday to visit his summer retreat.And ministers including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have also engaged in diplomatic activity in Europe in recent days as the Government seeks to deal directly with inidual governments in an effort to keep the Chequers plan alive.In a sign that member states are being warned of the consequences of the failure to find a deal, Dr Fox said: “It’s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission’s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies.”Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Priti Patel said Mrs May must ditch the Chequers plan, which would see a “common rulebook” for goods with the EU - effectively tying the UK to terms set by Brussels.Writing for the  website she said it did not meet the result of the referendum and “will leave us half-in and half-out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints”.Calling for a looser free trade deal with the EU she said the change would take “political courage, the kind of courage that appears to have been lacking over the past two years”.Labour former cabinet minister Lord Blunkett used a Sunday  article to reject claims that people who voted to Leave over immigration concerns were “racist” and said the result would be the same if there was another referendum.He argued that “people believed our democracy and political system did not reflect their concerns and their cry for help” following the impact of the financial crash and austerity, in many places hitting communities still coping with the aftermath of deindustrialisation.“To understand this, and why, if there were to be a second referendum now, I believe that the majority would still vote to leave, is critical if we are to get our democratic system back on track,” he said.

They currently have to opt in.The change to “presumed consent” has been praised by doctors and health campaigners, who have warned about the low numbers of available organs under the current regime. The new rules are expected to come into effect from spring 2020. The legislation is expected to return to the Commons in the autumn.There will be exemptions from the presumption that organs can be donated. Children under 18, iniduals who lack the mental capacity to understand the changes and people who have not lived in England for at least 12 months before their death will be excluded. The Department of Health and Social Care said specialist nurses will always discuss donation with families so an inidual’s wishes are respected. It said the change represented the views of the “vast majority of the population”.Theresa May suggested she backed the change in her Conservative party conference speech last year, saying 500 people had died in 2016 while waiting for a heart, lungs, kidney or liver.Campaigners have also raised concerns that under the current system, grieving families are asked to give consent to donate organs of their loved ones. Less than half give such consent. The overhaul will be known as Max’s Law, in honour of Max Johnson, a nine-year-old from Cheshire saved by a heart transplant.Simon Gillespie, head of the British Heart Foundation, said the change will “better reflect the views of the general public and give hope to those currently waiting for a transplant they so desperately need”.“This will also ease the agonising pain felt by many families who risk losing a loved one while they wait for an organ,” he said. “It’s still really important for all of us to have conversations with our loved ones about organ donation so our wishes can be met if the worst should happen.”Fiona Loud, policy director at Kidney Care UK, said: “For the 25,000 patients on dialysis in England, this means hope and a new future. Patients are dying every day while they wait for a transplant.“The change in the law must be accompanied by a comprehensive awareness and education programme and we need to ensure there is capacity across the NHS so that these precious organs are not wasted.”Jackie Doyle-Price, the health minister, said the move would save lives, but agreed that more work was needed to reassure people about donating. “We believe that by making these changes, we can save as many as 700 more lives every year,” she said. “But organ donation remains a gift. I want to encourage people who wish to give life in the event of their death to take the time to record their wishes and discuss it with their family.“However, we know this new system alone is not a magic bullet. We need to address myths and misconceptions around donation, and we will only do this by having informed debate and dialogue, which I hope will be fostered by these proposals.”Confirmation of the change comes after a consultation earlier this year, in which the government received an unprecedented 17,000 responses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73997ed85116779f5e7cf2864a513afc79b118ba/539_375_4309_2585/master/4309.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79fe110a4fe1f668a5f0dfbd7cfdf1dd","title":"england ben stokes india kohli","story":"In every match there are the moments that matter just that much more, when all the idle chatter stops, and some spectators fall silent while the rest start to sing and shout that bit louder still. And everybody there knows, just knows, that somehow, whatever happens now, the game is about to shift and twist one way or the other.That moment came at a quarter to twelve, 45 minutes in to the day’s play. Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya held off the opening blows from Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad and now they were starting their counterattack. England’s lead fell with vertiginous speed and all of a sudden their position felt queasily precarious again.Joe Root allowed Anderson and Broad one over too many. An understandable mistake, especially from a younger captain leading two old pros such as those. But a costly one. The adrenaline that flooded through England when Anderson dismissed Dinesh Karthik in the first over was exhausted and Pandya, who had played such a calm hand, was just feeling his start to flow. He whipped three runs out past Sam Curran at midwicket. Then Kohli hopped on to his toes and clipped four more through fine-leg. That took him to his fifty. He felt good now and when Anderson appealed for an lbw the next ball, Kohli grinned back at him, sure and secure.Broad whistled his first ball up full. Pandya hit it back past him faster. So Broad tried the inswinger. Pandya picked it and hit it through midwicket. India had scored 15 runs in eight balls, their target was cut to 52 and England’s grip was starting to slip.The India fans were doing all the chanting now, a drumbeat cry of “Koh-li! Koh-li! Koh-li!” So long as he was in, India would win. Root realised that he had to make a change, before the game got right away from him. So he threw the ball to Ben Stokes. “Stokesy’s just got that knack, hasn’t he?” Root said. “He loves the big moments.”It was Stokes who settled the Lord’s Test against New Zealand in 2015, when he had Kane Williamson caught behind and then bowled Brendon McCullum with his next ball Stokes who settled the Chittagong Test against Bangladesh in 2016, when he dismissed the last two tail-enders when there were 22 needed Stokes who settled the Oval Test against South Africa last year, when he got Quentin de Kock and Faf du Plessis in one over. And it was Stokes who seized the match here, finally swayed it England’s way after three days in which it had blown to-and-fro.Stokes’s first ball was short and slanted in towards Kohli’s chest. He rode it down to leg. His second was straighter, well wide of off stump and Kohli came across to steer it down to the off. The third was the sucker ball, full and fast, seven miles per hour quicker than the first of the spell. Kohli came across to the off-side again, too far, and tried to flick the ball away square. He missed. It hit his pad flush in front of leg stump. Stokes swivelled on his heels and screamed, both arms aloft, and then, when Aleem Dar raised his finger, fell down to his knees in celebration.Two balls later, he had Mohammed Shami caught behind. In all the excitement, everyone seemed almost to forget that England still had to win the match. It was Stokes who finished it by taking the last wicket, after a fine cameo turn from Adil Rashid.That kneeling pose of Stokes looked pretty familiar. It was similar to the one Andrew Flintoff threw when he bowled Peter Siddle at Lord’s in the second Ashes Test in 2009, his fifth wicket in his final Test at the ground. There was just a hint of the deeper emotions Stokes was feeling here, too.He is bound to miss England’s next Test because of his court case, which starts in Bristol on Monday. The charges have been hanging over him for six months now but it was only when this match, his last bit of cricket before court, was all over that the reality of the situation really seemed to sink in for him and everyone watching.Stokes bowled four overs on Saturday but he looked, and sounded, as if he had never been so exhausted. He could hardly string his words together. He tried to explain the delivery to Kohli, but could not, quite. All he really knew was that Kohli “had missed one for a change”. Stokes had spent every last part of himself for the sake of the team. “It’s just great to be a part of this group,” he said. The realisation came again, right then, that Stokes will not be part of it this coming week.Root tried to reassure him. “He’s so dedicated to this team,” he said. “Whatever happens, he’s always going to be a part of it.”But the truth is that right now Stokes does not know when he will next play for England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3334d8873e9ac5c03018e358244e6069d9728632/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5576b507b83d0762a7927aa7be8bfffc","title":"european championships adam peaty world record gold","story":"Like the Greatest Showman he is, Adam Peaty stepped into the spotlight of the European Championships on Saturday and delivered a performance that merited top billing, powering his way to gold in the 100m breaststroke at Tollcross.With a world record of precisely 57 seconds, another 13-hundredths stripped off a mark that he has pecked away at like a ravenous woodpecker, it was another astonishing evening in a life less ordinary.Maddening too, in a peculiar way, for the 23-year-old. He has long coveted the realisation of his Project 56, to be the first to swim his prime event in 56 seconds and whatever. One day very soon, you suspect. More likely, when there is a semblance of opposition clipping near his quicksilver heels.James Wilby, his GB teammate, was second but seemingly an ocean adrift. Peaty turned in 26.65 but ignited what he lovingly refers to as his afterburners. An aquatic patch of scorched earth was left behind as muscular shoulders and super-human legs propelled him towards one more slice of history. Yet he said: “It’s a weird one. Honestly, I wasn’t going out to do a world record.”Casual as you like. And it makes one wonder what a fully motivated, fully honed, fully emoted Peaty might accomplish at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. He had marked himself as a mere eight-out-of-ten coming in. The Europeans, where he first claimed a world record, holds a special place in his heart. This was his 10th continental title. Validation for a hard summer’s work.However, Japan is his rising sun and his moon. This is merely a fuelling stop on his rocket-propelled trip there. Better, he mischievously said grinning, to have been denied that miniscule moment faster, “because that gives me another level of motivation”.“If I’d got 56.99, I’d have been “oh, for God’s sake.’ I’d have achieved it and people would all have been talking about Project 55. It’s a great place to be. Break the world record by a marginal gain.“Two years out, it leaves me and Great Britain in a great place. You see Wilby down that last 50 and you’re looking at a very strong 100 breast. That’s the most important thing, that we can take on the world in the breaststroke. And if we can take that into the relay, even better. Who knows what can happen?”He still has the 50m breaststroke to come here. Perhaps another chunk off another of his global bests. And then some more. “Hopefully, I’ve still got another 10 years left in the sport,” he said. Chastened, usefully, with the rupture of a four-year streak of victories at April’s Commonwealth Games, the fires are burning ominously.“When you go four years without losing, you get complacent. Even if you don’t want to admit it to yourself. That team around you tries to keep you on track. There are a few ups and downs. But it’s great to have that close-knit family. It’s not just my performance. It’s my team’s and that spider web of support.”For Wilby, it was the second time he had followed Peaty home in one of these journeys into the record books. Silver was no bad consolation in this company. “It’s good to see a teammate do well,” he said. “We’re both based in Loughborough on a daily basis and it’s good to see him putting in good performances. Seeing him do that does motivate me but inidually we’ve all got our own targets.”There was bronze for the British squad of Stephen Milne, Craig McLean, Kat Greenslade and Freya Anderson in the new 4x200 mixed freestyle relay. James Guy took second place in his 200m butterfly semi-final to advance into Sunday’s final while the Commonwealth champion, Duncan Scott, was the fifth-quickest in the 100m freestyle semis.Siobhan-Marie O’Connor will vie for a medal in the unfamiliar surroundings of the women’s 100m breaststroke and Georgia Davies of Wales broke the European 50m backstroke record in the morning heats with a swim of 27.21sec but eased leisurely into the final.“I won’t underestimate my competition,” said Davies. “The field is really strong. The 50 is such a close race and one tiny mistake means you can lose everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fa9950560f726f03f80a2ffb5d7fdbfa71b44c/265_82_4539_2724/master/4539.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fb38aa38bba5f3c99725c8631920a92","title":"womens british open golf","story":"• Hall one shot back heading into final round• Thailand’s Pornanong Phatlum in the leadIt took until Georgia Hall’s 49th hole at the Women’s British Open for a scorecard aberration. That the 22-year-old responded so strongly from her first bogey illustrated a competitive spirit that will be necessary if Hall is to win her first major title on Sunday.Hall’s dropped shot at the 13th was offset – and more – by birdies at the 15th and 16th. After handing another stroke back to the course, at the 17th, Hall again fought back she birdied the closing hole. A third round of 69, Hall’s third sub-70 score in succession, leaves her one from the lead as held by Pornanong Phatlum with a round to play.Hall, who was third in the British Open a year ago, is seeking to become the third home winner since the tournament was afforded major status in 2001.“Today was harder than the first two days,” she said. “My long game wasn’t quite on but I putted very well. I’m in a similar position to last year and hopefully I’ll be a bit more relaxed this time.”Phatlum, who spent the day in Hall’s company, also signed for a 69 in moving to 13 under. The Thai has dropped one shot in the entire event, at the 12th in round three. She could become the third player from her home country to win a LPGA‑sanctioned event in three weeks, a statistic that endorses the strength of the game there. How will Phatlum keep calm in the frenzy? “I sing to myself,” she said.Ryu So-yeon has been perfectly open about her desire to claim a grand slam of major championships. Two of the five were already banked before Ryu was defeated in a play-off at the Women’s PGA Championship last month.The 28-year-old Korean was a factor in this tournament even before a third-round 67, which raised her to within two of the lead. Even more notable was that Ryu was two over par after four holes.“Sometimes it’s just better not to expect anything,” said Ryu of her strategy for Sunday. “I’ll just focus on what I can do, instead of predicting what’s going on.“I’m in pretty good position. If I can have this attitude tomorrow as well, I can play good.”This is quite the congested 54-hole scene. Minjee Lee, Mamiko Higa and Park Sung-Hyun sit at 10 under. A significant aspect of this major has been the lack of links wind a scenario which appears unlikely to change.Ariya Jutanugarn’s third round of 69 means she is not entirely out of the picture at minus six. Nonetheless, the world No 1 needs heroics – and favours from those higher up the leaderboard – if she is to prevail here. Lydia Ko is a stroke better off following her 70.Catriona Matthew, the champion at Lytham in 2009, cut a rueful figure after adding a 72 to rounds of 71 and 70. “I probably played my best golf of the week,” said the Scot. “Crazy game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b6536a1e1f7a2136289300ee3291d14ab0e4da/0_162_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743ff05033957598be20453d65c3e081","title":"denmark beach seaside scandinavia holiday cabin","story":"The first stop on Kevin Rushby’s summer tour of Scandinavia is Denmark, where he revels in open skies, serenity, comfort food – and eccentricityTucked into the dunes on the northern tip of Denmark’s Jutland peninsula is a tiny house of wind-worn clapboard. There’s a coffee table constructed of old beer crates, oil lamps hanging in the windows, a yard of books on the shelf and a well-trodden footpath to a vast sandy beach. Everything from the coffee grinder to the hammock seems well-made and dependable, stylish in an understated way. I throw myself into a chair next to a neat stack of precisely cut firewood. My Scandinavian summer starts here, in an idyllic cabin, a mile from Hirtshals, the nearest town.Most British summer holidays abroad involve the Med, or its surrounding countries, but I reckon the cooler attractions of the north need to be sampled. A reputation for being expensive, particularly for eating and drinking, deters many, but I’m hoping large doses of self-catering and camping will help on my five-week mission to discover the essence of the perfect Scandinavian summer. I’ll also be relying on the concept of naturens skafferi (nature’s larder), the laudable idea that the great outdoors is a pantry for everyone. The fishing rod is packed. The cloudberries are in season.My cabin combines all that’s best about the region: comfort, style, simplicity and a whacking great hot tub. I’ve got sun, sea and stacks of food. I’m ready.The British relationship with Scandinavia is not complex. We are in awe. They are better-governed, better-dressed, better-looking and write better crime novels. Of course, we can always claim a bit of shared ancestry. Many of the quiet Danish villages I had passed through on the train to Hirtshals had names that would fit seamlessly into the Lincolnshire or Yorkshire Wolds. In fact this rolling rural landscape dotted with woodland is not dissimilar, though cleaner and neater. As I’d gazed out that train window, I’d wondered: what if the Vikings had persisted a little longer with their civilising ventures into Britain, would London have the unhurried cool of Copenhagen, could Essex be tidy, and might there be no need for Luton at all?On my first day I wander along the massive west-facing beach towards Hirtshals, half an hour away. The great sweep of sand is dotted with driftwood and shells. It’s one of those big bracing strands where you either find a suntrap in the dunes to get out of the wind, or go running for miles. The waves are substantial and sprinkled with eider ducks, who chug along regardless, apparently not minding the breakers at all.At first sight Hirtshals is a tough little fishing port with few obvious attractions, but it soon proves fascinating. The harbour is full of busy boats and there is a wonderful chandlery, its cafe furnished with tables and chairs made from crates and driftwood. Nearby is a fiskehus, an outdoor fish restaurant, a common feature of Danish seaside towns, with a serving hatch, a blackboard menu and picnic tables. It does fish and chips, but the Hirtshals speciality is stjerneskud, which means shooting star: the dish was apparently invented to mark the visit of Yuri Gagarin to Copenhagen in 1962, a year after he became the first man in space.It’s an example of smørrebrød, or open sandwich, but this one is a spectacular assemblage of cod, smoked salmon, roe, shrimps, asparagus, dill, poached egg and rye bread. I wash it down with hyldeblomst saft (elderflower cordial). Danish cuisine has been criticised for over-reliance on dairy products and sugar (not by me), but these are not in evidence here. As for the sky-high prices: eating out is a little more expensive than in the UK, but I know I can bring overall costs down with canny supermarket shopping and days of self-catering.In a nearby shop I meet Johannes, a sprightly 96-year-old local who drives a Jaguar and sports a nifty waistcoat and neckerchief. “The Danish summer means beach, sunshine and fun,” he tells me, “but no wind.” I think the latter is a special request among the people of Hirtshals.Johannes recommends going to the museum to get the flavour of the town. This, I realise later, should be taken quite literally: the museum appears to double as a distillery and off-licence, making and selling various types of a “heritage” drink called bjesk, a kind of schnapps.Christian, the director, tells me that a local nurse, Signe Hansen, revitalised the tradition in the 1950s, collecting old recipes and inventing new ones using local herbs and flowers. “They say she had a syringe in one pocket and bjesk bottle in the other, and it was the bjesk that got people better more often.” I’m getting the sense that Denmark, under a composed and tranquil exterior, has hidden depths of eccentricity. They just don’t market it. In fact, they seem not to market anything. The country is a wonderful detox opportunity for the capitalism-worn Brit, weary of hard sell and shouty slogans. There is little advertising here. Perhaps predictably, the country’s most successful export of recent years has been the much-hyped concept of hygge, which seems to involve wearing hand-knitted socks while drinking homemade alcohol and eating homebaked cake by the light of candles, also preferably homemade, with family or friends – and not those met on Tinder. But when I ask a local what hygge is, he says simply: “It’s a sense of wellbeing, of belonging.”What does he think about the recent international interest? All those books and magazine features? He makes a face. “Hygge cannot be bought or sold.”In my cabin that evening I test the hygge potential. Candles? Tick. Alcohol? Yes, thanks to Christian at the museum, and it’s homemade too. Cake? No: just a few squares of left-over chocolate. Hand-knitted socks? Not a chance. But then at night, by the glow of the lamps, the wooden cabin steps up to the mark. There is no television or radio, which helps. I read. I fire up the hot tub. I lie back and listen to the wind rising. I get me some authentic Danish wellbeing.Next day, as though the Norse gods had heard Johannes and felt obliged to taunt him, it is fearsomely windy. Despite its cool, blowy weather, Denmark is regularly listed as the happiest country in the world. Cynics might point out it also has the highest per capita consumption of antidepressants, but the survey includes factors such as income, life expectancy, freedom and trust.I think, however, that there is more to it than those cold statistical measurements. For example, when I get on a bicycle and try to follow a cycle path, there are just some tiny waymarking signs, sparingly positioned at the most key points. I’m expected to be observant and to use a map and some common sense. Later, when I go to the station to ask about trains, I also ask if there’s a buffet car. The assistant smiles indulgently: “There is no food or drink sold on Danish trains.” I’m astonished. I’m used to British trains, where the arrival of the refreshments trolley is more reliable than the actual train itself. “People take their own smørrebrød,” says the assistant. “Or they wait until they reach their destination.”Self-reliance, I am realising, is a key Danish attribute (while, by European standards, obesity is not). I leave my Jutland cabin eager to discover more. At the station there is, of course, only one departures board and one sign pointing to the correct platform. Already I am feeling more alert, lighter and somehow less cluttered, perhaps a little bit Danish? I’ve even got a smørrebrød in my bag – admittedly from Lidl, but at least I remembered.The Scandinavian summer magic is beginning to work.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – at the time a 27-year-old bartender, now a progressive political star running for US Congress after she pulled off a fantastic primary upset in New York last month – sensed an underlying problem that was deeper than politics, more personal than demographic data.“I just really felt like our country wasn’t understanding itself,” Ocasio-Cortez told me by phone while campaigning for congressional candidate Cori Bush in Missouri. “We didn’t understand each other, and we didn’t understand ourselves as a collective nation.” It was almost midnight, and her voice sounded strong but tired. Our scheduled interview the previous day, when she visited my home district in Kansas to support another progressive candidate, had been postponed as she navigated her first appearance outside New York. I had figured I wouldn’t get a call at such a late hour and had already changed into my pajamas – an awkward accident that suited the vulnerable questions I intended to ask her about, oh, the meaning of life. As Ocasio-Cortez pondered her country’s sociopolitical disconnect in late 2016, she told me, she considered her part in it. Having grown up in New York City with strong family ties in Puerto Rico, Ocasio-Cortez had limited experience of the rest of the US – not so different, she said, than growing up in a small town.That changed in late 2016 when an organizer invited her to join protest camps demonstrating against the Dakota crude oil access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.Ocasio-Cortez and a friend packed an old Subaru and drove west. “The cigarette lighter didn’t work, so we couldn’t charge our phones,” she said, recalling plugging in at rest stops as they traversed Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota. They talked with people along the way. Ocasio-Cortez recognized their class struggles, so similar to the ones she saw back in the Bronx.When they reached Standing Rock, the destination proved to be as formative as the journey. There Ocasio-Cortez witnessed a “profoundly spiritual experience.” Each night in the camps, Indigenous activists entered wigwams to sweat and pray – an ancient ritual for purification and fortification. “Native American spirituality was the lynchpin for the water protectors there,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “That is where people get the strength.”Ocasio-Cortez was inspired. The next day, when a progressive political action committee asked her to run for office – the smell of campfire smoke still in her hair, perhaps – she knew the answer was yes.What is remarkable about this story is not that she felt transformed by an event that was both political and spiritual. It is that she dares to speak of it publicly.For decades, the two wings of US politics have dealt with spirituality in opposite ways. The God-wielding right proudly trots out organized religion to defend its views, and the secular, postmodern left keeps even non-religious spiritual experiences so quiet as to imply it’s silly or shameful to have them.That dichotomy has resulted in rightwing dominance of the spiritual space in the US. It’s been nearly 40 years since Ronald Reagan stepped into the White House with fundamentalist megachurch ringleader Jerry Falwell behind him. On the surface, during that time – the “family values” platform of so many Republicans influence of Christian televangelist Pat Robertson Donald Trump’s overwhelming support by Christian evangelicals – it would appear that conservatives owned faith.But today there is a marked shift in tone on the left – a reconciliation of the public sphere with private meaning, from social-justice-driven religion to non-religious, even atheist, humanism.Places of worship have become sanctuaries for immigrants at risk of deportation pro-LGBTQ clergy have stepped forward to combat hate within their denominations a rogue group of feminist Catholics is ordaining and recognizing women as priests whether the Vatican excommunicates them or not. An extreme climate is forcing politicians to invoke the concept of right and wrong. To describe government-sanctioned separation of families at the Mexican-American border, for instance, wonky policy language does not suffice.Liberal leaders from Hillary Clinton to Van Jones to Elizabeth Warren have summoned an old-fashioned word more often associated with the right: this is, they’ve said, a moral crisis.Like Ocasio-Cortez, I am a pro-choice woman who was raised in the Catholic church. Now happily non-religious, I’m used to holding simultaneous truths that are often painted as contradictory – like, say, revering hard facts while feeling motivated by something deeper than our minds can comprehend.The Poor People’s Campaign holds that same balance. Begun by Martin Luther King Jr not long before his murder and currently revived by the Rev William Barber of North Carolina and the Rev Liz Theoharis of New York, today the movement mobilizes people of all – or no – faiths across the country to fight inequality. Leaders draw on scripture alongside statistics to call out the immorality of corporate, government and social structures in the US. Among their fans is Bernie Sanders, who was raised Jewish but isn’t actively involved in organized religion. Sanders is not one to quote scripture, but he believes ethical imperative is the foundation of serious politics.“It’s hard to imagine why anyone would be involved in politics if one didn’t have a moral sense of right and wrong, of justice and injustice,” Sanders told me by phone from Washington not long after he visited Kansas with Ocasio-Cortez.As synchronicity would have it, he had a meeting with the Rev Barber that afternoon. Their rhetoric often sounds the same.“We are not a just and moral society when three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America. As we speak this moment, you got 40 million people living in poverty. Thirty million people without any health insurance,” Sanders said. “It is racial justice. It is environmental justice. It is issues of war and peace and trying to create a peaceful world, not a world where countries are aiming nuclear missiles at each other.”Ocasio-Cortez said she’s routinely asked about her avowed democratic socialism, but that political theory is not what drives her.“A moral imperative is absolutely part of how I approach public policy. Because if it’s not there, then what does?” Ocasio-Cortez said, noting that the tattered books that most shaped her politics were written by moral leaders such as King and Howard Thurman. “Everyone’s going crazy about socialism and democratic socialism. For me, that’s not my seat. My seat is a moral seat.” She said that we have long sought to be a rich society while failing to discuss the idea of a good society.“That is why we pay people less than a living wage. That’s why we allow people to be paid starvation wages. That’s why we allow people to go bankrupt in chemotherapy. That’s why we allow people to have their home stripped by a bank that manufactured the crisis in the first place,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Those are not the markings of a good society.” Critics call progressive platforms like hers unfeasible, but Ocasio-Cortez isn’t buying it. “In a society that is materially and logistically and in every way capable of ensuring people are paid a dignified wage, have healthcare, have access to an education and opportunity – if that is materially possible,” she said, “I feel like we are morally compelled to make it so.”In her 1997 book Healing the Soul of America, re-released in revised form last month, spiritual leader Marianne Williamson described our country’s political dysfunction as symptom of a greedy society that has not yet atoned for its crimes against native and enslaved peoples, exploited laborers, women and children. She called for politicians to work for good rather than for special interests or the status quo: “A conscience-based politics cares less for political expediency than for moral truth.”Sanders has spent most of his nearly 40 years in public office shunning political expediency, whether as an independent mayor, US representative and US senator in Vermont or as an anti-Wall-Street Democrat riling up the populist left with his 2016 bid for president.When I asked him whether a moment during his upbringing revealed an ability to stand outside the established order, he recalled seeing boys torment smaller boys on the streets of Brooklyn.“From an early age, I did not like bullies who were picking on kids who were unable to defend themselves,” he said. But dealing with political bullies can be a complicated matter. Sanders said that, when forced to weigh political or financial capital with his own ideals, the decision invariably involves compromise.“I can pick apart every vote that I cast which was a yes vote and tell you that there were things in it that I really, really disliked, without exception,” he said, citing his vote for the Affordable Care Act. “So the judgment there is, ‘Is this what I want? Is this my view of what the American healthcare system should be?’ The answer is no. Will this keep people alive who otherwise might die or become much sicker than they should? The answer is yes. In politics it is never black or white or as clean as you would like it to be.”When I was a kid in rural Kansas during the Reagan era, the prevailing comment about politicians was, “they’re all crooks.” This assessment sprang from geographic and socioeconomic removal from the formally educated, soft-handed places that decided their fates as farmers, carpenters, cashiers and shelf-stockers.But incrimination of corrupt leadership should not go so far as to ignore those who try to keep a pure flame burning amid the toxic winds of politics and government. “To be very honest with you, it is not easy,” Sanders told me. “It’s not easy at all. I would be lying to you if I did not tell you that Washington is a very, very different environment in which to survive with decency. It is a phony environment. It’s an environment where people are very nice to you and then will do everything they can to undermine you. It is an environment where there is an enormous amount of ego. So it is a tough place in which to work, and it takes a toll on me.” Sanders encouraged budding representatives to “find colleagues who share a common sense of justice and those with you in the fight” and make frequent visits with earnest activists. He had just left a visit with Vermont youth involved in an ACLU immigration effort.“It strengthens me,” he said. “It makes me feel much more human, talking to these idealistic young kids who are trying to do the right thing.”While Sanders has surely seen it all behind closed doors in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged what she doesn’t know as a first-time candidate.“I can’t go in with a plan” for staying true, she said. “It’s one thing to say it’s so corrupt and compromised. But you don’t see the small ways in which that is so.”She might re-read her favorite moral texts, she said, or try to visit her would-be constituents back in the boroughs more often than other representatives do. Running without corporate money set the right foundation for the path ahead, she said. Still, “you just don’t know until you get there. But you walk in with an intention and a commitment.”She listed US representatives whose integrity inspires her: Keith Ellison of Minnesota, Ro Khanna of California, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Raúl Grijalva of Arizona. She said she hoped to have the courage of California representative Barbara Lee, who amid 435 representatives cast the lone House vote against the Iraq War in 2001.“I think they’re holding the candles,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I hope to just be one more.”Principled defiance among political leaders does more than affect policy. It inspires people on the ground.Grassroots activist Davis Hammet, best known for co-founding a rainbow-painted LGBTQ activist center right next to the infamous Westboro Baptist hate group in Topeka, Kansas, grew up in a conservative district in northern Florida.In early adulthood, he became increasingly alarmed by the Republican Party’s rightward shift on social issues. But when two conservative bills – to force women seeking abortions to have ultrasounds and to attach teacher pay to student performance – crossed Republican governor Charlie Crist’s desk, Crist would not abide. He vetoed both bills and left the Republican party.“I saw that political courage and I was like, ‘Oh, it’s OK to leave,’” Hammet told me by phone from Topeka. “This is not my values any more.” So much progress hinges, it seems, on what we are brave enough to say.Since moving to Kansas to start Equality House, Hammet has conducted anti-bullying campaigns in Kansas high schools and founded the organization Loud Light, aimed at registering young people to vote.Hammet, who is 28 – the same age as Ocasio-Cortez – originally planned to call his millennial-enfranchising group the Kansas Center for Democratic Participation. But a friend pointed out the distance between the detached language and Hammet’s personal vibe. He dug deeper and came up with the name Loud Light, which he said encourages people to vocalize views built on peace and goodness.“‘Moral’ has almost this uncomfortable connotation for a lot of people,” said Hammet, a non-religious guy who describes his worldview as “quantum oneness.” “But you say ‘loud light,’ and I think people get it. They’re like, ‘Yeah, being outspoken about the good stuff.’”It makes sense, then, that – in a culture whose framework for morality has relied on religion for centuries – many liberals would struggle to find the words to talk about what moves them at the deepest level.Virtue is a murky, subjective realm. Perceived righteousness in the wrong hands has led to countless wars and tragedies. For me, a good guide is this: Any set of “values” that draws lines between or hierarchies among people is bogus.The burgeoning movement for social justice among the religious left, the spiritual nonreligious, agnostics and atheists seems, to me, legit for the way it brings people together rather than ides them.New Jersey senator Cory Booker recently reflected on the concept of unity for an episode of On Being, the seminal public radio show that examines life’s deepest questions. He said one of his favorite books, the 1960s sociocultural analysis The Fire This Time, by James Baldwin, outlines horrifying truths but ends with two hopeful pages about coming together.“Here is Baldwin, who just talked about these fissures in our society, that ends this book by calling to blacks and whites to be ‘like lovers,’ he writes, and to insist upon and create a new consciousness that he goes: Human history is, and negro-American history is, in particular, a perpetual testimony to the achievement of the impossible,’” Booker told On Being host Krista Tippett. “And this is what I operate on, every single day. I am the physical manifestation of these inidual choices that were made, by so many people, to choose light over darkness.”Booker, who told Tippett he had been advised to sound “tougher,” said he now unapologetically lets his love flag fly whether it’s good political strategy or not. Last May, he and Massachusetts senator Warren – both thought to be contenders for the Democratic presidential ticket in 2020 – were the rare politicians to deliver activist sermons from a pulpit at a large conference of pastors and seminary students in Washington DC.The most frequent discussion he had touring for his 2016 book United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good was with people seeking “a sense of connection to other Americans that transcends the things that seem to be iding us, a sense of yearning in this country for an understanding that we’re all in this together.” Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez carried a message of unity when they took their democratic socialist message to Republican stronghold Kansas in support of local progressive campaigns. Their rallies in Wichita and Kansas City drew thousands, and they reiterated the sameness of Kansas people and their communities back east.“I understand that there are differences between the people in Vermont and the people in Kansas,” Sanders told me. “But the truth is that in virtually every area of human concern, the commonality, the common interests, of the people in the two states far, far outweighs whatever regional differences there may be.” Hammet pointed out that even rural areas – on maps, the conservative red area of the much-touted “rural-urban ide” – contain seeds of understanding that might lead more people there to join a progressive movement about togetherness. “Small towns recognize that they need each other,” Hammet said, citing the community ritual of a barn raising. “One family cannot raise a barn. Everyone comes together and helps each other, and there’s a social capital there. It’s not even inherently expressed. Everyone knows, ‘you’re helping me and I’m gonna help you, because we can’t do this without each other.’” Many white rural voters have been written off by the left as a lost cause. But Hammet learned not to simplistically cast others as villains when, through his work with Equality House, he lived next to the homophobic Westboro Baptist group.“You have these people that are monsters of the world, and they’re my neighbors who I see laughing with their kids at the park,” said Hammet, who identifies as queer. “You’re forced to be like, ‘All right, how can I accept that these are normal people that have an extreme view?’ Dangerous and problematic but also human.”Hammet said that facing social woes means looking in the mirror.“Everyone wants to condemn Westboro Baptist church, but they don’t want to admit and confront their own prejudice,” he said. “It’s really too easy to be like, ‘look, they’re homophobic, look, they’re racist,’ but it’s a lot harder to be like, wait I have a little bit of racism in me. I have a little bit of homophobia in me.” For him, facing social woes means looking in the mirror.Anyone who labors today for social progress has no assurance it will come to pass tomorrow – and if it does it may not be in their lifetimes. This is a conviction that requires motivation beyond logic. This is a civic faith.During Ocasio-Cortez’s recent speech in Kansas in support of candidate James Thompson’s effort to flip that congressional district blue for the first time in 26 years, she encouraged the crowd of underdogs – progressives in a “deep red” place – to commit to changing political outcomes by tirelessly knocking on doors even as pundits and naysayers say they’re wasting their time.That’s how she beat the odds in her primary race, a street hustle that wore holes in her shoes as she spoke to voters face to face.“That conversation can never be un-had,” she told the crowd. “Those doors can never be un-knocked. And the power will never go away.” This reminded me of a line from the bestselling spiritual tome A Course in Miracles, which defines “miracle” not as a favor granted by a bearded deity but as the correction of a misperception – specifically, the shift from fear to love: “A miracle is never lost. It may touch many people you have not even met, and produce undreamed of changes in situations of which you are not even aware.”One change that has been dreamed of, among this progressive set, is a “blue wave” of liberals winning races across the country in the fall midterm elections. Whether that comes to pass, Hammet said the civic engagement that so many previously apathetic Americans are awakening to – participating in “deciding what tomorrow looks like” – is an energizing force with many benefits. “I’ve had so many of my friends commit suicide. One thing I always felt is, they feel powerless to change anything. So I view civics as a health crisis,” he said. “We have to make people feel that power and live that power. The revolution is there. If people vote, it is a completely different world.” No one knows that better than Sanders, who in 1981 won the race for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, by 10 votes. He likened that victory to Ocasio-Cortez’s unlikely win. “She was a 100-to-one underdog,” Sanders said. “Turns out that the opposition was not quite as strong as people thought it would be. We’re seeing that all over the country. Sometimes when you do the right thing – and you organize at the grassroots level and you have ideas which resonate with people – you can do remarkable things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/464e928daf6d5e4a074a721615387d2f479d344d/0_162_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5910bc9149fbe3c9d59ae185ccac4fdb","title":"boat loving italian mp resigns after media lynching over attendance record","story":"Five Star Movement’s Andrea Mura rejects criticism that sailing distracted him from jobAn Italian sailing champion turned MP – who justified frequent parliamentary absences by saying he could do politics from his boat – announced his resignation on Saturday, blaming a “media lynching”.In his resignation letter, Andrea Mura said he had always taken his parliamentary mandate “with the greatest seriousness” but that he had been unfairly rounded on by the media with “ignominious and groundless accusations” which his Five Star Movement (M5S) had not given him the opportunity to explain.Since his election in March, Mura had turned up for only eight of the assembly’s 220 votes, according to monitoring website OpenPolis.The 2010 Italian Sailor of the Year, however, breezily rejected criticism last week, telling Sardinia’s La Nuova Sardegna newspaper: “Political activity is not only conducted in parliament.

They were attracted by its stance on corruption, but also by the party’s pledge to help small businesses, slash red tape and lift people out of poverty, and by its emphasis on the environment.But two months into the M5S-League coalition government some have major doubts. Last week Roberto Fico, M5S MP and president of the chamber of deputies, spoke out against a controversial pact with Libya that sees migrants forcibly returned to war-riven north Africa.On the night of 30 July, according to the International Organization for Migration, almost 350 people were taken back to Libya. Fico commented: “Libya is not a safe landing point. Human rights are not guaranteed, so migrants cannot be left there.”He has also clashed with Salvini over his xenophobic rhetoric and blocking of Italian ports to rescue ships. “I don’t want to close the ports,” he said. “We need to talk about immigration with intelligence and heart.”Other M5S politicians have come forward as attacks on immigrants have risen. There have been 12 shootings, two murders and 33 physical assaults in the two months since Salvini became interior minister. “All of us, starting from those in the political world, have the responsibility to create a barrier to these unacceptable, cowardly episodes,” M5S MP Vincenzo Spadafora said last Monday.Discontent is also simmering among M5S voters, particularly in the party’s southern stronghold of Campania, where Fico and party leader Luigi Di Maio are from.“I was against M5S collaborating with the League,” said Paolo Silletti of Caserta, near Naples, “mainly because I hate Salvini. For years he insulted people from the south. Many others I know who voted for M5S also do not like the coalition the two parties don’t have many points in common.”M5S supporters were also unhappy about a proposal last week by Lorenzo Fontana, the families minister from the League, to scrap the anti-fascist Mancino law, passed in 1993 to outlaw racist violence and hate speech. Di Maio was quick to point out, via Facebook, that this was not part of the coalition’s plan. Many responded with online comments lambasting the government. “Be quiet before many of us repent for having given you our vote, only to find homophobes and xenophobes in government,” said one.Di Maio has been silent on immigration, referring to Fico’s stance as his “personal opinion”. Giuseppe Conte, the unknown professor M5S and the League agreed on as prime minister, has so far had little sway over the two party leaders.Other M5S MPs are taking a neutral approach, arguing that the party must honour the immigration policy agreed in the coalition deal. This included plans to clamp down on migration across the Mediterranean, and to accelerate deportation of an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants.“We need to implement what we wrote in the joint programme,” Laura Castelli, undersecretary for the economy ministry, told the Observer.Piera Aiello, MP for the Sicilian city of Marsala, said that going back on the agreement could jeopardise other joint policies. “Rightly, we’re not for absolutism or just abandoning people,” she said. “But at the same time we can’t say ‘everyone’s welcome’, only to cast people aside like urchins. Yes, we need to act with humanity, but the responsibility needs to be shared across Europe.” Rino Marinello, an M5S senator also from Sicily, said Salvini’s initiatives were a result of mistakes by the previous leftwing government. “Immigration here has not been well managed – people come, but they have no opportunities to work or build a life,” he said. “Opening our ports while the rest of Europe shut theirs was a problem. Our priority should be developing a policy that improves lives for people in Africa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7566aa74c47b0d563947c7c537ce5fb41b38df7f/0_116_4884_2931/master/4884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20fb332b0171001a6130a6ab475118be","title":"soviet hero konev statue prague spring","story":"Rewritten plaque on Konev statue will tell of general’s role in suppressing Prague SpringRussia has been accused of interfering in the affairs of the Czech Republic after its embassy tried to block changes to the inscription on a Soviet-era statue.Russian diplomats say councillors are trying to rewrite history with proposed wording explaining the chequered role of Russian Marshal Ivan Konev, who was twice designated a Hero of the Soviet Union by Stalin and whose remains are buried in the Kremlin. The diplomats have successfully delayed the change after petitioning the mayor, lobbying the foreign and culture ministries, enlisting the support of other former Soviet states and, most recently, invoking an obscure 1985 treaty on the protection of Europe’s architectural heritage.Now the dispute is set to come to a head at a historically sensitive moment, as the local authority seeks to install the revised inscription by 21\u0026nbspAugust, the 50th anniversary of the 1968 invasion of then-communist Czechoslovakia by Soviet-led forces to crush the liberal Prague Spring. The new plaque – inscribed in English, Czech and Russian – will assert that Konev was involved in planning the invasion.The imposing monument in Prague’s affluent Bubeneč district – created by local sculptors in 1980 when Czechoslovakia was a Soviet ally – has been a source of contention and a target for vandals since the communist regime fell in the 1989 Velvet Revolution. After earlier proposals to dismantle the statue or reduce its scale were shelved, attention shifted to its glowing Czech-language inscription, crediting Konev with saving Prague from destruction by Nazi occupying forces in May 1945, when the Red Army liberated much of the country.Critics said the original plaque, which was removed several weeks ago, exaggerated the marshal’s role while omitting more notorious subsequent actions – including commanding the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising and overseeing the building of the Berlin Wall, besides leading reconnaissance missions for the 1968 invasion.“The previous plate was actually lying,” said Ondřej Kolář, mayor of the Prague Six municipality, where the monument and Russia’s embassy sit. “When Soviet troops arrived in Prague on 9 May 1945, there was only one SS ision here and that was on the outskirts of the city. The Wehrmacht had surrendered to the forces of the Prague uprising, and left the previous day.“The city was basically free, but that wasn’t something Soviet propaganda wanted to use. We are not denying the role of the Red Army or saying the Soviets didn’t suffer. They suffered a lot – but not in Prague.”The new engraving credits Konev with commanding forces “who liberated northern, central, and eastern Bohemia” and says they were “the first to enter Prague on 9 May 1945”. It links him with the events in Hungary and Berlin and adds: “In 1968, he personally backed the intelligence surveillance preceding the invasion of the armed forces of the Warsaw Pact into Czechoslovakia.”The inscription’s accuracy has been endorsed by the Czech army’s Military History Institute and the Academy of Sciences, and by independent local historians. “The words are correct,” said Petr Blažek, a historian with the Prague-based Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes. “Konev’s role in 1945 is generally known – his role in 1968 and 1956 much less so.”However, it has provoked a furious response from the Russian embassy, which dismissed the connection with 1968 as “unsubstantiated allegations” and said the new inscription “distorts the original monument”.“The unmistakable change in the appearance of a monument important to preserving the memory of our nation’s heroic struggle against Nazism creates a dangerous precedent,” said Nikolay Bryakin, an embassy spokesman.Kolář – a member of the pro-EU Top 09 party, who says he has received anonymous threats over the issue – called Russia’s tactics “blackmail” and said they were part of an effort by the government of President Vladimir Putin to influence Czech politics and assert influence over former Soviet satellite states. “What allows the Russian state to tell another sovereign country that is a member of the European Union and Nato what it should or shouldn’t do with its own property? It’s as if we’re their colony,” he said.But the Russian position is backed by the Czech Communist party (KSČM), which recently reached a deal to keep the current minority Czech coalition government in power.Josef Skála, a former party vice-chairman, called the inscription change “a dirty game” and added: “Would you be happy if a text appears on the monuments of Winston Churchill, depicting his role in the death of millions of innocent people?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3586920.1533405965!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"refund of 550 urged for ireland squad who must pay to play","story":"Joyous scenes as hockey supporters at Railway Union Sports Club in Sandymount, Dublin and the Glenside Pub, Churchtown near the Loreto Hockey Club celebrate as Ireland Ladies qualify for the World Cup final. Video: Cyril Byrne  Ronan McCreevy\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Labour Party is extremely critical of the representation fee which the victorious hockey players are obliged to fork out. Photograph: Sandra MailerInphoThe Labour Party has called on the Government to refund the Irish women’s hockey squad the €550 each paid to represent Ireland. Labour Party Cork local area representative Peter Horgan described the representation fee as a “shameful practice”. “The Ireland squad is the first Irish team to reach a world cup final in any sport. They have done so in a sport where most of the teams they face are professional,” said Mr Horgan. “These women have brought pride, grit and determination to the finals in London and they should never have been in the situation where they had to pay to represent their country.“The Ministers for Sport – Shane Ross and Brendan Griffin – must instruct Sport Ireland to make a once-off payment to this team and put in place provisions that no team . . . will have to pay to represent this nation in their respective code’s finals.” The Irish men’s and women’s hockey teams receive funding from Sport Ireland, the Women in Sport programme and from Sport Northern Ireland to prepare for the World Cup. Nevertheless, the shortfall means that each squad member has to pay €550 to represent their country. Neither Mr Ross nor Mr Griffin mentioned the €550 payment in their congratulatory message to the team. Mr Ross said he considered himself “very fortunate” to have witnessed their success. “ No other team has played on such a stage and they have truly lit up the country as we joined them on this epic journey,” he said. “ The courage and nerve shown by the whole squad and management but particularly by Gillian Pender and Ayeisha McFerran in the penalty shootout was a joy to behold. “I am sure up and down the country young girls and boys will be trying to replicate those outstanding moments for years to come. And we wait with bated breath in the hope they bring home the cup either way they have done us all so proud.”DUP leader Arlene Foster was among the politicians who congratulated the Irish women on their success.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Englishmen abroad are warned to stay out of the midday sunChuckle Brothers star Barry dies at 73, as comedy partner Paul pays tribute to \u0026#39my very best friend\u0026#39Body found as police search disused quarry for missing midwifeQueen Elizabeth I had a secret friendship with French King, newly uncovered letters showRural crime soars as thieves target farms and country businessesUncorked: Eric and Ernie\u0026#39s drink-drive adHMRC launches internal investigation into conduct of officers involved in flawed prosecution of London restaurateurProtesters clash with police as alt-Right rallies in PortlandVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blames enemies as he says he survived \u0026#39drone death attempt\u0026#39Russia appoints Hollywood star Steven Seagal as \u0026#39goodwill ambassador\u0026#39 to USPresumed consent for organ donation will save up to 700 lives a yearHammond urged not to launch \u0026#34tax attack\u0026#34 on second home owners with new buy-to-let levyHS2 spending needs an extra £43bn to ‘make it worthwhile’, Government\u0026#39s infrastructure tsar saysComment: When people reach the end of their HS2 journey they will in many cases face inadequate public transport linksBBC will not appeal Cliff Richard privacy ruling for fear of public outcry over legal costs if they lost Government plans to redirect lorries carrying perishable goods in event of No Deal BrexitJohn McDonnell criticised after hard-Left allies claim Jewish leader is part of smear campaignMore stalkers walk free from court despite numbers of cases triplingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/13/10/Cyborg_Neil_Harbisson.jpg","title":"human evolution religion neanderthal modern civilisation","story":"Created with Sketch.Adorn ourselves with technologies as we may, our brains can\u0027t get out of\u0026nbspcaveman combat mode.

Inevitably, since the outer world replicates the inner, there is also a conflict being acted out between them all around the world. And at the moment, so far as I can see, the caveman is winning out over homo deus.I am currently in New York. When I got here the clocks, on EST, were five\u0026nbsphours behind London time. But my biological clock was set to GMT. Hence jet lag, the queasy sensation of shifting from one time zone to another, getting ahead of or falling behind the chronology of the sun. I got over it in a day. I adapted.But there is a larger sense in which we have never fully adapted to a much longer shift in time. The hunter-gatherer co-exists within the city-dweller. I can go about Manhattan, technologically enhanced, relying on satnav and a weather app to guide me, while at the same time, in one part of my brain, convinced that I am hunting a woolly mammoth, and potentially prey to saber tooths.I am both urban vegetarian and bloodthirsty not-so-noble savage. This is the 100,000-year jetlag, which we still haven’t got over. We are the messed-up, conflicted product of asynchronous development (which I date, very approximately, from the hypothetical origin of language).We are out of sync with ourselves. We really do suffer from déjà vu, the sense of having been here before, but long long ago, the primal memory of palaeolithic\u0026nbspbehaviour engraved deep in our neural pathways. It’s probably the fundamental insight of evolutionary and anthropological thinking of the past couple of centuries, from Cuvier and Lamarck on.Flintstone\u0026nbspand Space Oddity, aiming at the stars and still roaming about the Kalahari\u0027 (Getty)Like archaeopteryx, every bird is part dinosaur. In the same way, we are a curious mix of Fred Flintstone and Space Oddity, aiming at the stars and still roaming about the Kalahari. Current conflicts bear this out. In the UK, it’s all about leaving versus remaining. In the US, it’s red states versus blue states. But these arguments could not even exist if that cognitive dissonance was not already in place in the vast collective unconscious.We (in our split psyche) want it all. Red and blue, leave and remain – which is why Theresa May’s dog’s dinner approach might actually stand a chance, since it reflects a fundamental reality. Half-in, half-out is exactly where we are in terms of our development as a species. An intermediate, morally ambiguous state.The great 19th-century French sociologist, Auguste Comte, taking the long view, formed the opinion that humanity had traversed two earlier phases, the theological and the metaphysical, and we had finally broken through into the more scientifically informed sunlit uplands of “positivism”. Maybe he really believed this, but it’s roughly on a par with saying “good dog” to a particularly troublesome beast. It’s borderline wishful thinking. We have somehow managed to telescope Comte’s three\u0026nbspstages into one highly confused state. The inescapable truth of our day is that the mythic never went away. Our thinking is mytho-positivist.\u0026nbspThe global village makes us conscious of how connected we are. Not only with one another but with other species too. Unless you’re Robinson Crusoe, interdependence is the central fact of our everyday lives. No man is an island. We are, as the quantum physicists say, entangled. And yet we are seemingly ruled by manic isolationism and naked tribalism. I offer just a few examples of our 21st-century schizoid mind.We began with sacrificing animals to the gods. Then we moved on to humans. We created a whole religion out of a single act of crucifixion. A religion in which even God seems to think that by sacrificing someone (his son?) he can placate the gods. It may be the most magical feature of fascism. If we get rid of them, all of our problems are over. In Occupied Paris even the Nazis were surprised at how willing the French (some of them) were to go along with this idea.“Why didn’t you provide more evidence for your existence?” Bertrand Russell said he would say to God. He assumed it would eventually go out of fashion. But if anything it’s been making a comeback. Religion is recycling itself. Nothing is more depressing than to see a dogma passed on from one generation to the next, like a baton in a relay race. We can only hope that someone will drop it. I get the need for some kind of emotional reassurance in a world in which everybody dies. But doesn’t it still make more sense to seek it from fellow mortals rather than from an immortal (who is surely bound to be indifferent)?Digital photogrammetry being used to record 3D images of the micro-topography on the tops of the lintels at Stonehenge.

It’s one of the worst things you can personally do for the planet. Unless you happen to be a member of the meat marketing board, no one seriously thinks that meat is good for you. Hunting once had a logic – survival – and it is possible that hunting might have provided the core of our earliest narratives around the campfire. But the industrialisation of meat is just an absurdity.AFPGetty Images)Probably one day this phase in our development will come to be seen as on a par with cannibalism. Meanwhile, we remain nostalgic for the kill. Even if someone else is doing it for us.Everybody now knows (in the empirical part of the brain) that sugar is bad for you. Sugar is the biggest single cause of type 2 diabetes. Even the Tate and Lyle website seems to suggest you might want to tone it down just a little bit. Meanwhile, we continue to crave it and consume it in vast quantities. It made sense when, back in the day, there was so little of it around. Now there is too much but we haven’t adjusted our mindset. Yet.\u0026nbspSimilar to sugar. The positive thing to be said for sex is that it marked a huge advance on self-reproducing amoebas. It may be more fun, although it’s hard to know with amoebas. Sexual bifurcation has served its purpose. But everything a vet was saying to me the other day to deter me from breeding a dog also applies to humans: it’s painful, it’s liable to cause trauma, it spreads disease, and there are enough stray dogs around already. In-vitro casual encounters appear to be the way forward. Thus transcending the frenzied, exhausting performances of masculinity and femininity.\u0026nbspMade sense when our existence really was liable to be cut short by wolves, bears, and man-hunting species. Now, in the age of the anthropocene, it’s all the other way around. Made in the image of a rather vicious God. A zealous evangelical once put a helpful leaflet in my hand, with a graphic depicting humans on one side of an abyss (man and wife with two kids and a car) – and cows and goats and dogs and cats on the other side.Cersei Lannister is ruthless in her quest for power\u0026nbsp(AP)But the ingenious thing about the cartoon was that it somehow suggested that all the non-humans secretly want to become human. Humanity is what poor old animals can only aspire to.Other than dragons, the whole raison d’être of Game of Thrones is to emphasise – quite rightly – how primal we remain in our thinking. Practically everyone wants to be king or queen. Kill everyone who gets in your way. The Old World primate is never far away.Modernity is part of the myth. We remain pre-modern. As Claude Lévi-Strauss points out in The Savage Mind, 99 per cent\u0026nbspof our culture was formed before the invention of writing. The rise of thrillers and “crime” is a manifestation of the jetlag. We still think in terms of a saviour figure, whether detective or not, who has come to redeem the darkness. The cynegetic paradigm (so named by Carlo Ginzburg) embraces both hunter-gatherers following a scent or a trail and a clue-hunting Sherlock Holmes (and a Sigmund Freud psychoanalysing our conflicts). The retro appeal is the key to the success of, for example, Stephen King. Something wicked this way comes. Serial killers are real, but we also re-invent them to have the pleasure of killing them off.Strangely related to “crime”, possibly without the quote marks. The time is more out of joint in our politics than ever. As above we are still looking for a charismatic saviour figure, a Shane-style gunslinger to ride into town and clear out the bad guys, to purify, or “drain the swamp”. The politics of paranoia require us to be afraid of all the other mad tribes out there. Post-truth began around 100,000 years ago, at exactly the same time as truth, when people realised they could lie about practically anything and yet still be believed.\u0026nbspHow literature has been committing mass femicide for centuriesHere’s why Google Translate will never outsmart the human mindA second Cold War is upon us: and we only have ourselves to blamePerhaps the only really interesting question of our times is whether we can ever transcend our atavistic impulses and finally get over the 100,000-year jetlag. Without wishing to strike an absurdly over-optimistic note, I think we can. Are we pre-determined in our behaviour by a 100,000 year legacy (or, in reality, much longer)? Are we locked into our past?I think the answer to this question is that only when we realise exactly how determined we are by our pre-history will we then cease to be completely outflanked by our own DNA. A friend recently put a Neanderthal flint axehead in my hand, roughly 250,000 years old. As I held it I could definitely feel a kind of ancient resonance rippling through my cells. The old ways. I could easily see myself smashing in the skull of some poor passing creature with it. Or an enemy. Perhaps if we at least start to acknowledge how mythic and murderous we really are, then there is at least a possibility of becoming more altruistic.\u0026nbspAndy Martin is the author of \u0027Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me\u0027 and teaches at the University of CambridgeEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

But we know a growing percentage are kept indoors in Britain and never experience sunlight on their backs or grass under their feet.\u0026nbspBernard Matthews labels show the countryside with green grass but the reality of life for their turkeys is probably anything but outdoors. We suspect they are raised intensively because the company doesn\u0027t participate in any assurance schemes.He added: “If consumers could see behind closed doors they’d be shocked.\u0026nbspIf a pig is kept intensively all its life – with mother sows unable to even turn around to interact with her young – shoppers should be told.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspbrands we\u0027ve highlighted are just the tip of the iceberg - there are many out there with misleading labels.​CiWF is about to launch a petition calling on the government to make it compulsory for food firms to state the method of production on labels.“Labels on intensively reared products frequently display misleading images of rolling landscapes and happy animals, when in reality the livestock are crammed into barren cages, kept indoors all their lives or kept in such close confinement that they are unable to express their natural behaviours,” Bronwen Reinhardt, honest labelling campaign manager at CiWF.Misleading slogans and images undermine farmers who genuinely operate to high welfare standards, she said.Earlier this year the environment department (Defra) ran a public consultation on the future of food and farming after Brexit, with a document that said: “It is not always clear to the consumer what standards underpin welfare terminology and definitions on labels, such as ‘grass-fed’, can vary between retailers. We are considering whether providing greater clarity of information to consumers could support higher welfare production.”In a speech in January, environment secretary Michael Gove said: “I want us, outside the European Union, to develop new approaches to food labelling… there’s still no single, scaled, measure of how a farmer or food producer performs against a sensible basket of indicators, taking into account such things as soil health, control of pollution, contribution to water quality as well as animal welfare.“We’ve been in discussion with farmers and food producers about how we might advance such a scheme and I think that, outside the EU, we could establish a measure of farm and food quality which would be world-leading.”More appropriate slogans would be ‘raised in confinement’ or ‘grown quickly without access to the outdoors’Mr Gifford said what’s needed is a system similar to that introduced for eggs in 2004 that made production method labelling compulsory, after which free-range and organic egg sales “went through the roof”.Mandatory production and slaughter method labelling was one policy Labour promised in its 50-point animal-welfare plan published in February.As milk prices have fallen in recent years, under-pressure farmers have moved towards more intensive systems, building vast sheds packed with dairy cows who are fed not on grass but on protein-heavy diets to boost milk production.Research by World Animal Protection has found Britain now has about 100 industrial “mega-farms”, each housing up to 3,000 cows that are kept permanently indoors.CiWF)Many farms keep cattle indoors some of the time and allow them outdoors at other times.But some have estimated that all “zero-grazing” systems – accused of causing painful lameness and mastitis because cows stand on concrete floors for prolonged periods – are in place in one in five British dairy farms.\u0026nbspAccording to Labelling Matters, a coalition of groups lobbying since 2011 for a law on production method labelling, such a step would benefit not just shoppers and farm animals but farmers too, creating a level playing field for them.A spokeswoman for Mondelez, which owns the Dairylea brand, said: “The farmers that supply to us graze their cows whenever weather conditions and location allows, and wherever this is appropriate and manageable from their perspective.\u0026nbspTherefore, it is not practical or possible for us to guarantee that 100 per cent of the cows providing our milk can graze 100 per cent of the time.\u0026nbsp“Ensuring that suppliers take good care of their herds is fundamental to ensuring our cheeses are made with high-quality milk. The environment in which the cows are kept is a key part of that and protecting them from physical and thermal discomfort, fear and distress is a priority for our suppliers.”The Independent has asked the Two Sisters Food Group, owner of the Bernard Matthews brand, for a comment but had not received one at the time of publication.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/24/19/web-uk-troops-pa.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/24/19/web-uk-troops-pa.jpg","title":"sas helicopter low flying driver dash cam lake district cumbria","story":"Created with Sketch.Brian Weatherall and family come within metres of passing helicopter in Lake DistrictClick to followThe Independent Online\u0027SAS\u0027 helicopter leaves driver startled after coming within feet of roadA driver said he was thankful for a lucky escape after a\u0026nbspclose encounter with a helicopter\u0026nbspin the Lake District.Brian Weatherall, 45, was\u0026nbspdriving along a misty lane in\u0026nbspKirkstone Pass\u0026nbspwith his family when the aircraft emerged unexpectedly from the fog, forcing him to hit the brakes.Dash-cam footage of the incident shows the aircraft passing with\u0026nbspwithin metres of his\u0026nbspcar.After the helicopter disappeared\u0026nbspfrom sight, Mr Weatherall can be heard saying to his family: “Dear me.

Both backed the idea of a “double referendum”.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading spokesperson for the People’s Vote campaign, told The Independent: “The Brexiteers hold themselves up as champions of democracy and have at various stages been advocates of a referendum on the final Brexit deal – eagerly so in the belief they would win it – and now have backtracked as their promises have run off the rails during the negotiations.Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrats\u0027 Brexit spokesperson, said: Giving people the final say on the Brexit deal is essential and common sense - the Brexiters who one claimed they\u0027d trust people to have the final say must now come clean on why they\u0027ve changed their mind.A cynic may suggest it\u0027s because of the mess Brexit is becoming and the increasing clarify on the damage it will do the United Kingdom.“They need to explain why they think an elite in Westminster should determine what the UK should do at the end of this process, and not the people.”In a speech in parliament in 2011, Ms Rees-Mogg suggested a second referendum could be held and that it would “make more sense” if this was after Britain completed\u0026nbspnegotiations with the EU”.Responding to a question about how the Brexit referendum would work, he replied: “That issue can be dealt with in the legislation. Indeed, we could have two referendums.“As it happens, it might make more sense to have the second referendum after the renegotiation is completed.”People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMore recently, Mr Rees-Mogg has\u0026nbspsaid calls for a second Brexit vote on the final deal negotiated with Brussels are “absurd”.Earlier this year he told LBC: “It’s quite clear that people have voted to support leaving the European Union.“It is slightly to my mind contentious of democracy to say, ‘we don’t like the vote so you will vote again, and then you will vote again until you do what we say’. That has been the European Union’s approach too many times.”David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, also previously proposed a “double referendum”.In a speech in 2012, he said the government should first spell out what sort of relationship it wanted with the EU, and put this to a public vote in a “mandate referendum”.A second vote should then take place after negotiations with the EU, he said. In this “decision referendum”, “the British people would either approve the new negotiated relationship, or if it was not good enough, it would trigger the negotiation to leave the Union”.He said: “This approach has a number of advantages: the mandate referendum would stiffen the spines of our negotiators, and undermine the legitimacy of the European resistance to change. One of the characteristics of the EU is that it never backs down in the face of national demands except when they are backed up by a referendum.“This in turn would mean that British citizens would be offered the best possible circumstances for staying in, as well as a real alternative in pulling out. The purpose of this strategy is to maximise both the democratic legitimacy and the negotiating leverage to achieve our policy aims.”Mr Redwood backed Mr Davis’ proposal\u0026nbspin an article posted on his website in 2012.He said the public should be given a vote on whether they wanted the UK to “negotiate a new relationship with the EU based on trade and political cooperation”.May to meet Macron in last-ditch bid to win Brexit concessionsBrexit uncertainty holding back new business growth in UK services Brexit is set to betray working people, so I back a Final SayFollowing negotiations, they would then be asked whether they wanted to withdraw from the EU.In a post in 2012, he wrote: “The second referendum would follow once the negotiations were complete. That would ask: do you want to accept the new negotiated relationship with the EU or not? Voting No means withdrawing from the EU.“This seems to me to be the best way forward. The negotiations would also allow the government to negotiate the items that would need to be sorted out for exit anyway. There do need to be arrangements on ferry routes, airspace, pipelines, extradition, police intelligence and all the rest between the UK and the rest of the EU.”Mr Redwood also used a  article in the run-up to the 2016 poll to suggest a second referendum was a certainty if Britain voted to remain in the EU.Explaining why he no longer backed a second referendum, Mr\u0026nbspRedwood told The Independent: The double referendum strategy was proposed when the leadership of the Conservative Party refused to offer a simple LeaveRemain referendum in a manifesto to see if they could accept that instead. They didn’t.Subsequently they agreed to a one\u0026nbspreferendum approach, as did the people in the general election and the Parliament which followed. You can\u0027t change strategies – we did not have a mandate referendum, we held a single LeaveRemain referendum which now has to be implemented.Mr Rees-Mogg and Mr Davis\u0026nbsphave been contacted for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/04/16/wind-power-hay.jpg","title":"wind power conservative mp constituents onshore renewable energy green power","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027The time is now right for those MPs who have opposed onshore wind to throw their support behind the UK’s cheapest new power source\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsNearly three quarters of people in the constituencies of anti-onshore wind MPs support the technology ​MPs who called for an end to\u0026nbsponshore wind\u0026nbspfarms\u0026nbspare out of step\u0026nbspwith their own constituents’ views, according to a new poll.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree years ago\u0026nbsp79 Conservative parliamentarians\u0026nbspsigned an open letter in which they called for a block on new onshore developments in England.After their election victory, the government changed planning rules and barred onshore wind developers from competing for subsidies - which amounted to an effective ban for the technology.However, new polling conducted for green campaign group 10:10 Climate Action, suggests their constituents\u0026nbsplargely disagree with them.Nearly three quarters of people\u0026nbspacross their constituencies supported onshore wind\u0026nbspand nearly the same proportion said they would be happy to live within five\u0026nbspmiles of turbines.Only six\u0026nbspper cent would actively oppose developments, contradicting the government’s assertion that communities in England do not want new wind turbines in their vicinity.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”.Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions.Most people were unaware that new developments had been blocked, with only 12 per cent aware of the measures the government has introduced.The findings were revealed after another poll commissioned by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit from YouGov showed that just eight\u0026nbspper cent of MPs know that onshore wind farms are now the cheapest way to add electricity generating capacity in the UK.The same poll found that MPs consistently overestimate opposition to onshore wind.\u0026nbspWhile government figures show just two\u0026nbspper cent of the population “strongly” opposes the technology, half of polled MPs thought the proportion of the population was closer to a fifth or 20 per cent.\u0026nbspThe government has tweaked its own rules to allow wind projects in remote regions such Scottish islands to compete for subsidies, but the block is effectively cemented in most of the country for the foreseeable future.Referring to the latest figures, Ellie Roberts, campaign manager at 10:10 Climate Action, said: “This polling adds yet further to the growing body of evidence that in all corners of the UK onshore wind is popular.\u0026nbspThe time is now right for those MPs who have opposed onshore wind to throw their support behind the UK’s cheapest new power source – with the enthusiastic backing of their constituents.\u0026nbsp“It’s on all of these Conservative MPs to push the government to listen to public opinion by removing the planning blocks on onshore wind.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/08/injured-soldier-0.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/08/injured-soldier-0.jpg","title":"maduro assassination venezuela president nicolas colombia santos latest caracus","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027This was an attempt to kill me,\u0027 says visibly shaken premier, who points finger at leader in\u0026nbspneighbouring ColombiaClick to followThe Independent USNicolás Maduro assassination attempt: Venezula president says drone attack was \u0027far-right\u0027 plot to kill himVenezuelan president Nicolás Maduro\u0026nbsphas said an\u0026nbspapparent assassination attempt on him while he delivered a speech on live television was the result of a plot by the far right.Several drones armed with explosives were flown towards the stage from which the leader was delivering his address, but they blew up before they reached the the 55-year-old.It was not immediately clear whether they detonated prematurely or whether they were shot down.Seven people were injured in the incident, but the president was unharmed, Venezuela’s\u0026nbspinformation minister said.Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, Saturday, Aug. 4, 2018.

The town received two inches of water over a very short period, causing some areas to be evacuated.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/04/17/bees.jpg","title":"us bee pesticides ban overturned neonic population decline wildlife refuges","story":"Created with Sketch.Environmentalists warn reversal of policy could pose threat to \u0027most vital and vulnerable species\u0027Click to followThe Independent USNeonic pesticides have been linked to the decline in bee populationsDonald Trump\u0027s administration has reversed a ban on the use of pesticides that have been linked to declining bee populations and the production of\u0026nbspgenetically-modified crops in US wildlife refuges.The rollback, announced in a memo by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, will\u0026nbspend a two-year ban from the Obama-era brought in following a lawsuit by environmentalists.Limited agricultural activity is permitted on some refuges by law, including cooperative agreements in which farmers can grow certain crops to produce more food or improve a habitat for wildlife.Campaigners have said the lifting of restrictions poses a grave threat to pollinating insects and other creatures relying in toxin-free environments.“Industrial agriculture has no place on refuges dedicated to wildlife conservation and protection of some of the most vital and vulnerable species,” said Jenny Keating, federal lands policy analyst for the group Defenders of Wildlife.Previously, the US had prohibited the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, or neonics, on wildlife refuges, in conjunction with genetically modified organism (GMO)\u0026nbspcrops, engineered to resist insect pests.Neonics are a class of insecticides tied by research to declining populations of wild bees and other pollinating insects around the world.Rather than continuing to impose a blanket ban on GMO crops and neonics on refuges, Fish and Wildlife Service deputy director Greg Sheehan said in a memo\u0026nbspthat decisions about their use would be made on a case-by-case basis.Mr Sheehan said the move was needed to ensure adequate forage for migratory birds, including ducks and geese favoured and hunted by sportsmen on many of the nation\u0027s refuges.US interior secretary Ryan Zinke, whose department oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, has made expansion of hunting on public lands a priority for his agency.Sheehan wrote that genetically modified organisms have helped “maximise production, and that neonicotinoids might be needed to fulfil needed farming practices.”World news in picturesPresident-elect, Emmerson Mnangagwa steps onto the lawn to pose for photographs and selfies after attending a press conference on August 3, 2018 in Harare, Zimbabwe.

But India’s system of insurance for those that succumb ensures owners have no incentive to properly care for them.Members of Save the Asian Elephants (Stae), together with actress Evanna Lynch, who starred as Luna Lovegood in the\u0026nbspHarry Potter franchise, are presenting a petition of 200,000 signatures and an open letter to Ms May, calling for:The Department for Environment, Food and\u0026nbspRural Affairs (Defra) to support a new law to ban the advertising or promotion in or from the UK of unethical Asian elephant-related holidays abroad\u0026nbspTheresa May to honour the government’s 2015 election manifesto pledge to “support the Indian government in its efforts to protect the Asian elephant”Ms May and environment secretary Michael Gove to begin talks with India’s leader Narendra Modi to end the beating of baby elephants to “break their spirits”\u0026nbspand to restore the proper treatment of captive elephantsThe government to pressure India to release captive elephants to protected forests or genuine sanctuaries and to help establish a model elephant sanctuary, as well as a training centre for mahouts (drivers) and veterinary exchanges between the two countries to raise standards of careThe pressure group also wants the Association of British Travel Agents to press its members to advertise only genuine elephant sanctuaries or wildlife reserves where elephants are observed from a distance, with no rides,\u0026nbsptrekking, chains, costumes, festivals or circus tricksAt the same time, the charity World Animal Protection has compiled a list of five of the best ethical elephant venues to visit, based on its worldwide research.The Stae activists also have the support of Peter Egan, who starred in Downton Abbey, Ever Decreasing Circles and Hold the Sunset.Ms Lynch said: “I want everyone to know of the cruelty and suffering endangered Asian elephants go through due to misinformed holidaymakers paying for elephant entertainments at many tourist attractions.\u0026nbspPeople wrongly assume the elephants are trained humanely. “So often they have no idea the Asian elephant species is threatened with extinction.”We must stop the ruthless treatment of these sentient creatures who feel pain, suffering, terror and loneliness in captivityCaptive elephants are often poached from the wild when they are calves to be “trained” for attractions such as giving rides, festivals, circuses, parades and working at temples.Witnesses said\u0026nbspeach animal is isolated in a wooden “crushing” cage, starved, sleep-deprived, hit with iron bars, planks and spikes, and beaten into submission. This “pajan” process is so violent it is believed more than half of the young elephants die during or after it.Their ankles often become painfully infected from where they have been chained.The torment can lead elephants to attack tourists, sometimes fatally. Duncan McNair, chief executive\u0026nbspof Stae, said he believed it was illegal not to warn tourists of the dangers they face.“I’ve yet to meet anyone in the west who thinks it’s a good idea to beat and torture baby elephants,” he told The Independent.\u0026nbspHe said although they were expecting some resistance from those with a vested commercial interest, the huge support for an advertising ban made it an obvious step to take.David Cameron promised in 2015 to help India improve elephant welfare and now that time is running out the Brexit talks should not stand in the way of government action, Mr McNair\u0026nbspsaid.“Some ministers say a great majority of 52 per cent voted for Brexit but in this, 89 per cent backed urgent action.\u0026nbspWe’ll be talking to Labour about this too. The Conservatives must not have their clothes stolen on it. I would be deeply shocked if we\u0026nbspdidn’t get a positive response from Michael\u0026nbspGove.”Asian elephants have\u0026nbspbeen on the IUCN Red List of endangered species since 1986 after the population plummeted from millions in the late 19th century\u0026nbspto fewer than 40,000 worldwide, of which one in four is captive.\u0026nbspThe letter to Ms May says: “This wondrous, ancient species now stands in our lifetime exhausted,\u0026nbspbeaten and broken, at the end of its long journey, on the very precipice of its existence. Your influence and that of your Defra secretary of state could now yield results to announce to international acclaim at this October\u0027s lllegal Wildlife Trade conference in London, and to show UK global leadership, before it is too late.”A poll for Save the Asian Elephants, taken in June, found 89 per cent of people believed the pajan training for the tourism industry was unjustified\u0026nbspand 87 per cent would avoid a tourist experience if they discovered the elephants had been treated badly.\u0026nbspAs well as the 200,000-strong petition, another 2.6 million people have signed similar petitions against the cruelty.The new campaign is being launched to coincide with World Elephant Day\u0026nbspnext Sunday.A Defra\u0026nbspspokesperson said protecting elephants was a government priority, adding:\u0026nbsp“We take the plight of Asian elephants seriously, which is why we recently met Save the Asian Elephants to discuss what more we can do.\u0026nbspThe Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London later this year will offer us a chance to discuss what action can be taken to support these majestic animals.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/04/22/gettyimages-187985473.jpg","title":"france nuclear reactors shut down edf europe heat wave","story":"Created with Sketch.Power plants halt temporarily as record-breaking temperatures sweep across EuropeClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe Fessenheim nuclear powerplant is pictured during a nuclear accident simulation on November 14, 2013France has been forced\u0026nbsp to temporarily shut down four nuclear reactors as\u0026nbspsoaring temperatures hit\u0026nbspthe region, energy company EDF\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbspThe company halted a reactor at Fessenheim – the country’s oldest nuclear power plant – in eastern France, in order to keep the plant from overheating the nearby river.It had already shut down three other power plants near the Rhine and Rhone rivers for similar reasons earlier this week.The power plants use water from the rivers to cool down their reactors, before sending the water back into the rivers. Overheated waters can result in mass fish die-offs, like those that occurred in Germany this week.The shutdowns are just the latest inconvenience in the heat wave that has descended on much of Europe in recent weeks. A drought sweeping Switzerland has left herds of cows stranded without water. The\u0026nbspcountry’s helicopter association and Air Force have been called to transport tens of thousands of gallons of water every week to sustain them.Earlier this week, officials warned vacationers in Portugal and Spain\u0026nbspto stay indoors, as parts of the region reached record-setting high temperatures. Meteorologists predicted some areas could beat the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe – 48C, recorded in Athens, Greece, in July 1977.Spanish and Portuguese\u0026nbspweather services put a health warning in place until Sunday, noting that temperatures would be especially severe in the southwest. At least three people in Spain have already reportedly died from heatstroke.Wildfires have also sprung up in Portugal’s Algarve, mirroring the deadly fires burning in Greece, Sweden, and the west coast of the United States. Scientists previously told The Independent that such fires were becoming more common, and more intense, due to climate change.A recently released study from the University of Oxford found that climate change had more than doubled the likelihood of the current heat wave.“The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable – the world is becoming warmer and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,” said one of the report’s authors, Dr Friederike Otto, deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.“What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace – in some cases, it already has, he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/998869_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news theresa may eu divisions chequers brexit plan latest","story":"Mrs May met her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Friday and while the French insisted that the meeting did not show Macron was prepared to \u0026ldquospeak in place of the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Jones suggested that the talks between the leaders showed a growing desire for them to take hold of negotiations.Last weekend Mrs May also secured the chance to put her proposals to EU heads of state at an informal summit on September 20.Mr Jones, a minister for Brexit for a year between 2016 and 2017, said that now was the time to dump the Chequers plan, which involves staying in the single market in all but name.A number of ministers, including David Davis and Boris Johnson, quit in protest at the proposals, saying they would water down Brexit and leave Britain in \u0026ldquomiserable, permanent limbo.                Expert warns only way to get Brexit deal is to remain in customs unionMr Jones said: \u0026ldquoThe Chequers proposal has not met with the approval of the public and has undoubtedly caused problems for the party.\u0026ldquoBut the isions opening up among EU member states now offer the Prime Minister a real opportunity to get Brexit back on track.\u0026ldquoShe should take full advantage of these isions and mount a serious attempt to secure a Canada-style free trade deal.\u0026ldquoShe should also make it clear that if the EU does not agree to this, Britain is entirely happy to revert to World Trade Organisation terms of trade, which will be sufficient for the UK.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen agreed that the time is right for a rethink.\u0026nbspHe said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May should use this excuse to dump the toxic Chequers proposals.The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to get the UK\u0026rsquos departure \u0026ldquoback on track (Image: )Mrs May met her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Friday (Image: AFP)No10 has remained tight-lipped about the outcome of the Macron meeting.

Heres how you can figure out the temp no matter the format.Degrees Celsius is the most common format of temperature in the UK.It comes from the Metric system of measurement, whereas Fahrenheit is taken from the Imperial system.The UK began the switch to the Metric system from the Imperial system in the 60s.The Metric system started being taught in schools in 1974, meaning that most people are more familiar with Celsius than Fahrenheit.If the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius then it will be 32 degrees Fahrenheit.In order to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the °C temperature by 1.8 and add 32 to the number.This is the answer in °F.In order to convert degrees Fahrenheit into Celsius, first, take the °F temperature and subtract 32.Multiply the number you are left with by five, then divide the number by nine.This is the answer in °C.The hottest temperature in the UK was recorded in Gravesend, Kent on Sunday, August 10, 2003.The temperature hit 38°C (100.6°F), topping the last record taken earlier that same day in Heathrow, where the temperature soared to 37.9°C (100.2°F).Before that record-breaking day, the hottest temperature ever recorded in UK history was in Cheltenham in 1990 the mercury hit 37.1°C (98.8°F).A more recent record came on June 21, 2017, when Britain had its hottest June day for 40 years.The temperature was recorded at Heathrow, where the thermometer hit a scorching 34.5°C (94.1°F).That Wednesday came close to the highest June temp ever recorded - 35.6°C (96.08°F) recorded in Southampton in June 1976. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest...While there is not a country-wide hosepipe ban in place currently, some regions are affected.On July 16, it was announced United Utilities was restricting hosepipe use for seven million households from August 5.The ban would apply to its domestic customers in the North West after reservoir levels in the region became dangerously low.Use of hosepipes or sprinklers for watering private gardens and washing private cars would also have been restricted.Three days before the ban was due to come into force United Utilities announced they had scrapped their plans.While warning there was a possibility of a ban in the near future, the company cited increased rainfall and less water consumption as the factors behind its decision.A separate hosepipe ban was activated in Northern Ireland - coming into effect at 6pm on Friday, June 29.NI Water chief executive Sara Venning said: We have maximised our water production and need customers help to reduce demand.We are asking customers to take heed of the hosepipe ban and stop non-essential water use - using hoses and sprinklers is causing demand to exceed the capacity to supply.Some water companies have asked customers to cut back on their use although have stopped short of an official ban.On June 28, Southern Water asked people to spend no longer than four minutes in the shower.The last major hosepipe ban took place in 2012, with 20million customers affected.Temporary bans can make it illegal for householders to water gardens or wash the car with a hosepipe.They can also ban people from filling swimming pools, ponds and fountains from the mains supply, and cleaning windows, paths and decking with a hose.Gardeners can still water the plants with a watering can.During hosepipe bans consumers are also urged to be considerate with their water usage.People are asked to have showers rather than baths and to make sure they dont leave taps running while they shave or brush their teeth.Utility firms are given the powers under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which extended previous laws.They can limit any or all of the activities, all the time or at set times of the day, for as long as they think necessary.Anyone found guilty of breaking a ban can be prosecuted in a criminal court and fined up to £1,000.Water companies have the power to impose restrictions on how households can use water in times of serious shortage.Providers are meant to cut the following years bills by a reasonable amount to compensate for the limited supply during any ban.The shortages are almost always caused due to a below average amount of rainfall.A drought is when there is an exceptional period of low rainfall - causing reservoirs to run dry.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest on the UK water shortage...Millions of Brits in the North West were facing up to the prospect of a hosepipe ban.On July 16, it was announced United Utilities would restrict hosepipe use for seven million households from August 5.The Sun had exclusively revealed the firms plans to introduce a ban after it urged customers to ditch baths for a quick shower.However, the proposed ban was called off on August 2 as the group cited increased rainfall, lower temperatures and decreased water consumption.It came after people across the country are being urged to be water wise by letting their lawns go yellowy-brown and not washing the car.But elsewhere in England and Wales, water companies said they had no plans for a hosepipe ban.The Department for the Environment has asked people to limit their showers to no longer than four minutes.And people are encouraged to think of ways to cut water use — turning taps off when brushing teeth, fixing leaks and only watering plants when absolutely necessary.United Utilities looks after water supplies in the North West of England.It had announced a temporary use ban which had been due to come into force on Sunday, August 5, but that has now been cancelled.Northern Ireland Water, in charge of the water supplies in Northern Ireland, issued a hosepipe ban on June 29 amid the ongoing heatwave.It limits the use of tap water for essentials like drinking, cooking and washing.It bans the following:Severn Trent supplies water in the Midlands.It has also warned a hosepipe ban is on the horizon due to unprecedented demand.Doug Clarke of Severn Trent said: Demand for water is massively up thanks to several weeks of extremely hot weather.While we have lots of water available and our reservoir levels are healthy and were putting millions of extra litres of water into the system, people are using water as fast as we can treat and pump it into supply.This is particularly the case during peak demand in the morning and evenings when we want to ask customers to restrict their supply so we can avoid areas of low pressure.Affinity Water, which supplies Hertfordshire, has posted advice on water usage on its website.It has asked customers to use a watering can in the garden, take shorter showers and turn off the tap when brushing teeth.Affinity Water said: We usually supply on average 900million litres of water each day to our 3.6million customers and we have had to significantly increase the amount we put into production to meet this demand. Our current average during this time is 1,200 million litres of water per day.“Although recent rainfall has been below average, the wet start to spring helped groundwater recover to near normal levels.It is unlikely that restrictions will be needed this year.Yorkshire Water offers a water saving pack and Kent supplier Southern Water says avoid non-essential chores.Ben Earl, water efficiency manager at Southern Water, said: “Our customers are already among the most water efficient in the country but there are simple things you can do to reduce waste - and cut your water bill.“In the heat wave, people should be neighbourly - preserve supplies by using water butts to water plants - brown lawns recover quickly.” South Staffs Water said reservoirs were healthy and Anglian Waters reservoir levels were where they should be or slightly above average.South West Waters total reservoir storage was 78.4%, compared to 74.3% at the same time last year.Northumbrian Water, Bristol Water and Thames Water all said they were not planning bans, while Wessex Water said there was no prospect of imposing the regions first hosepipe ban since 1976."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424223326.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rod liddle column food shortage","story":"Stacking up the tins of beans and Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie ready for Armageddon and Year Zero?My guess is you’re not.

For having believed the “lies” of the Brexit campaign.But it is hard to imagine anyone could be quite so stupid as to really believe we’ll be short of food if we tell our European friends to shove their deal where the sun doesn’t shine.They even had a debate on Remainer Central (that’s BBC Newsnight to you and me) about what we could put in our sandwiches if we fail to sign a deal. Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know. We’re just leaving an undemocratic bureaucracy.Do these dingbats really think that the Spanish tomato growers and the Dutch pig farmers are going to refuse to sell us anything? Or that we would refuse to buy their produce? Get real.The debate about whether we should leave or remain in the EU was pretty shoddy. There was exaggeration and outlandish claims made by both sides.I never believed the rubbish about an extra £350million a week for the NHS. And if I’d thought we were going to do that I’d probably have voted Remain. If ever there was a waste of money, that would be it.The difference is, the Remainers believe all the crap that’s spouted by their side. Every bit of it.Just as they believed the economy would be wrecked within a week of the vote. When actually it has been doing very well indeed and is projected to do even better.Sky fallen in yet? Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations. We’ll all starve! No medicines!The threats come from our own remainers — but also from within the EU. Especially (quelle surprise) the awful French.Have you ever known a people more clingy? Listen, mon ami — it’s over, we’re leaving. Our bags are packed and ready in the hallway.It was fun while it lasted (well, actually, it wasn’t THAT much fun) but now we’re going. Try to get over it. And stop the blackmail, you ludicrous little people.Jeremy Hunt — never my favourite politician — has at least started well as our new Foreign Secretary.Warning the EU that it will lose far more than the UK if there’s no deal.No kidding, Jezza.We import far more from the EU than we sell to them. There is not the slightest danger of those imports being prevented from arriving here. To suggest otherwise is utterly absurd.OH God, Madonna’s at it again.

It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson? Disengage with these foul Islamist countries. Leave them to it. Our people have rights.And they supersede the rights of fundamentalist Muslim fanatics to claim asylum in the civilised, Christian, West.SO, the courts have decided that people who don’t necessarily want the right to die can have the right to die if other people think it’s best for them.What a bizarre judgment.This applies largely to elderly people in a locked-in state, that is a persistent vegetative state. If the doctors and relatives think it’s time to turn off the life support, they can now do so.But people sometimes recover from these conditions.

Probably not going to get much better, frankly.”Relly: “Oh, that’s a shame.”Doc: “Yes. And we rather need his bed for another old gadgie who’s about to pop his clogs. Did you like him much, your dad?”Relly: “Um…bit of a miserable old git, really. Cantankerous. Suffered from bad flatulence too, in later years . . .Doc: “Still does!”Relly: “But we’d be very interested in what his . . . you know . . . will has to say. If you catch my drift.”Doc: “Ah, indeed.

That scandal has been exposed by actual journalists.In fact Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, almost wrecked the trial of some accused of serious crime, thus potentially denying both them and their alleged victims justice.Yesterday he was freed on appeal over his contempt of court. Supporters say he was locked up too hastily and for too long. But he was already serving a suspended sentence for the same offence.His many convictions stretch from violence to fraud. We have no sympathy.The case he jeopardised in Leeds had reporting restrictions, temporarily preventing details being publicised. They’re neither unusual nor a politically-correct cover-up. They’re to avoid prejudicing and collapsing other trials linked to it.Robinson blatantly flouted them, was in contempt — and admitted it.Yes, our legal system IS too secretive. On this occasion it was crucial in the interests of justice.It’s time his supporters grasped it.WHAT a surprise. Remember  the scare story that Brexit would kill 200,000 City jobs?Now the City of London Corporation forecast is 5,000. Even they may not happen.

£3bn over a decade - on the scheme.The government believes handing refugees cash and debit cards cuts bureaucracy, delivers value for money and gives dignity back to people in need of help.Last year, it was revealed that a similar scheme was being used in Pakistan where people were pictured at ATM machines withdrawing money from the UK government, reports the Daily Mail.However, tens of millions are already spent by other parts of the DfID budget on similar cash transfer initiatives.The scheme in Pakistan is not believed to come out the humanitarian aid budget but another part of the department’s spending.According to the Mail, some people using the cards in the country claimed they had received them after bribing officials.A DfID spokesman said the government uses “robust” checks including biometric technology to eliminate fraud.He said: “UK aid can be the difference between life and death for many of the worlds poorest people, and our cash transfers are helping to eliminate fraud and deliver maximum value for money for UK taxpayers.“We have robust checks, including biometric technology, to make sure every penny of UK aid goes to those who need our help the most and evidence shows that in some cases cash transfers can deliver double the benefits of food aid.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000422917985.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"job seekers refund cash back benefits dwp","story":"Around 4,000 Brits are owed a total of nearly £2million in benefits after a five-year legal fight against the Department of Work and Pensions over their controversial workfare schemes.The schemes made it compulsory for jobseekers to work for free or have their benefits docked.But after graduate Cait Reilly won a landmark Court of Appeal victory over her unpaid work placement in Poundland, the coalition responded by passing an emergency law in 2013 to make the schemes legal.This meant ministers could avoid refunding £130m to those who had had their benefits sanctioned from when the scheme started in 2011 to 2013.A court found in June that this rule change meant a specific group of jobseekers had lost their right to a fair hearing under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.And now details released under the Freedom of Information Act show between 3,789 and 4,305 people are expected to be paid back £1.7m to £1.9m in lost benefits, the Mirror reports.Those who are eligible for the refund must have been had an appeal in the system by March 26, 2013, against the workfare schemes.Under the new ruling, known as the remedial order, those seeking compensation must also have had their jobseekers allowance sanctioned under that programme.Those who are eligible are unlikely to be able to apply until Spring next year - as Parliament first needs to be consulted this Autumn.The amount claimants are owed depends on your original payment and personal circumstances, so it will vary from case to case.Blogger Frank Zola, who obtained the figures, told the Mirror all those whod been sanctioned under the original schemes should be refunded the full £130million.But the DWP insisted there was no reason to refund all claimants sanctioned between 2011 and 2013.In its FOI response, the department said sanctions are an important part of a fair and effective welfare system.You need to:To find out if you are eligible contact the DWP helpline on 0345 608 8545In a statement the DWP added: It would be unfair and unacceptable that claimants who have failed to take all reasonable steps to increase their chances of finding work obtained advantage over claimants who complied with the benefit conditionality requirements.Today a spokesman added: “We are currently consulting with Parliament on these changes and will publish our response in due course.”If you think you might be eligible, you should call the DWP helpline on 0345 608 8545."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424704618.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tattoo skin peel off toni mansfield flint","story":"Toni Mansfield was rushed to hospital after her hand swelled up where the inking had been.The 28-year-old was left in unbearable pain and feared she would need a skin graft after suffering what tattooists believe was an allergic reaction, Daily Post reports.Mum-of-three Toni had been at her second appointment at the Studio Thir13een parlour in Flint when her hand begun to swell.She said: For the next appointment I put on some numbing cream to help with the pain. About an hour in to having it done my hand started to swell and my skin started to come away.“I started to feel really faint because the pain was so bad. I went to A\u0026ampE because the pain was unbearable and I couldn’t put my arm down without it throbbing.“They told me I might end up needing a skin graft because it was so infected.”Toni was put on antibiotics to clear the infection and was given a refund by the salon after she complained.But she says she is unable to take legal action against the shop because she signed a disclaimer before getting the inking done.She has now had another tattoo on her hand to cover up the “pink blob” left behind - despite being left “scared” of getting anymore tattoos.John Payne, 39, who co-owns the parlour with Bryan Stephens, 42, said: “To me it looks like she’s had some sort of reaction to the ink used.“This is rare but unfortunately it can happen. We gave her a refund which she seemed happy with at the time.“We are under the impression that Ms Mansfield has tried to put in a claim against us but due to lack of evidence it hasn’t gone anywhere.“This is an attack on us as a business and we are seeking legal advice.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000359327049.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady switch off phone","story":"Remember the days when a mobile phone was like a hulking great brick? Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We believe that by making these changes, we can save as many as 700 more lives every year.“But organ donation remains a gift. I want to encourage people who wish to give life in the event of their death to take the time to record their wishes and discuss it with their family.“However, we know this new system alone is not a magic bullet. We need to address myths and misconceptions around donation, and we will only do this by having informed debate and dialogue, which I hope will be fostered by these proposals.”Under-18s, people with limited mental capacity and others who have not lived in England for at least a year prior to their death will be exempt from the scheme.It follows a consultation earlier in 2018 which drew 17,000 responses from the public.The legislation, which was introduced in Parliament in July 2017, will return to the House of Commons in the autumn.Those who do not wish to donate can record this on the NHS register either online, by phone or on an app to be released by the end of the year.A 12-month transition period will pave the way for the launch.Last year 411 people in the UK died on the transplant waiting list.Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “There is a desperate shortage of organ donors in the UK.“Introducing an opt-out system in England will better reflect the views of the general public and give hope to those currently waiting for a transplant they so desperately need.”Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPS, welcomed the news but added: “Until this new system comes into effect in 2020, the country is likely to remain desperately short of donors and too many lives will continue to be cut short because of a chronic lack of organs – many of which are completely safe and suitable to use.“We recognise that some people are opposed to organ donation for a number of reasons, and that must be respected, but we urge anyone else who is not currently a donor to become one.”GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The International Trade Secretary rates the chances of a no-deal Brexit at 60-40, even though both sides say they want to reach an agreement on the terms ahead of the UK\u0027s departure in March 2019. Prominent Brexiteer Dr Fox has heaped the blame on Europe\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brussels\u0027 unwillingness to compromise which he branded intransigence - while at the same time holding firm to his own Government\u0027s stated plan. I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us towards no deal, he told the Sunday Times.  We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit - not a people\u0027s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.  He said Mr Barnier had dismissed the UK\u0027s proposals in the Chequers plan thrashed out by Theresa May and the Cabinet simply because we have never done it before.  The Government has admitted its proposals are unprecedented, but Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0027s response makes the chance of no deal greater. The Prime Minister held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, cutting short her holiday to visit his summer retreat.  And ministers including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have also engaged in diplomatic activity in Europe in recent days as the Government seeks to deal directly with individual governments in an effort to keep the Chequers plan alive. In a sign that member states are being warned of the consequences of the failure to find a deal, Dr Fox said: It\u0027s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0027s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies. Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Priti Patel said Mrs May must ditch the Chequers plan, which would see a common rulebook for goods with the EU - effectively tying the UK to terms set by Brussels. Writing for the  website she said it did not meet the result of the referendum and will leave us half-in and half-out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints.  Calling for a looser free trade deal with the EU she said the change would take political courage, the kind of courage that appears to have been lacking over the past two years. Labour former cabinet minister Lord Blunkett used a Sunday  article to reject claims that people who voted to Leave over immigration concerns were racist and said the result would be the same if there was another referendum.

And the Lanigan family claim its because they are 100 per cent medicine-free.  Antibiotics, painkillers, immunisations and even Calpol are banned by parents Richard and Janette. They even kept one baby out of hospital when doctors told them she was likely to die from whooping cough – and claim the natural nutrients in breast milk kept her alive. Sisters Molly and Isabelle, 14, and Eloise, 11, have never taken part in national immunisation programmes. So they haven’t had jabs for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, haemophilus influenzae, hepatitis B, rotavirus, meningitis B, measles, mumps or rubella. In fact they’ve never even had a Lemsip!  And former chiropractor Richard, 61, insists more families should follow their example. “The evidence clearly demonstrates you can strengthen children’s immune systems by letting them play in the dirt and get infections,” he says. “If my kids’ bread dropped on the floor I’d pick it up and put it back in their mouths. “I strengthen my girls’ immune systems by allowing them to get diseases. “They have less time off than other kids at their school, but that’s not because of one particular thing – it’s a way of life.” He adds: “If you look at how we evolved, humans got stronger by getting illnesses. “The process of natural selection meant the strongest survived. By getting ill it makes us stronger. Natural selection means survival of the fittest – it’s harsh but true.”  If the girls are in pain at the family home in Thames Ditton, Surrey, the strongest treatment Dad prescribes is ice... or maybe a flat Cola because he believes the acid kills bad tummy bacteria. “Ice is the most effective anti-inflammatory and pain relief but there’s no money for the pharmaceutical industry in frozen water so they encourage people to take drugs.” Richard insists: “I am not anti-drugs. You definitely need them in some cases. “But anything in excess damages health. I must be doing something right because it’s unusual to have children who have never needed antibiotics.” And he adds: “If my girls got hit by a bus they’d go to A\u0026ampE – that’s what emergency medicine is good at. “But they’re not so good at healthcare. If they were, we wouldn’t have the rise in autoimmune disorders and chronic illnesses like Type 2 diabetes.”  Though daughter Isabelle had chickenpox as a youngster, the first time any of his kids had painkillers was when Eloise hit her head aged seven and went to A\u0026ampE. Two nurses had to pin her down to give her Calpol because she didn’t know what it was and was so horrified she spat it out. Asked by medical staff if his daughter was allergic to antibiotics, Richard had to admit he had no idea – because she’d never had any. “The nurses were looking at me like a new age freak,” he recalls. “They couldn’t believe that she had never had antibiotics by that age.” Richard even claims he treated his own rectal cancer with cannabis oil after refusing modern treatments and survived despite being given just months to live. He questioned Britain’s reliance on vaccinations after doing a masters in health promotion in 2004.

There’s no better time to explore the very best of the Great British coastline, so pack up the beach toys, grab the sunscreen and get going. Get prepped before you go Before you set off, consider getting a Free Car Check at Halfords to put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too. Pembrey Sands, Wales  Located inside the Pembrey Country Park, this coastal highlight has eight miles of beach and something for everyone. Enjoy the sands in the morning and then head into the woodland for some shade in the afternoon. There are activities here, too, including cycling opportunities, a dry ski slope and an adventure playground. There’s also a campsite if you need a place to pitch your tent for the night. If you don\u0027t already have a tent and you\u0027re not sure where to start, check out the Halfords Tent Selector which will help you find the tent which best suits your needs.   If you\u0027re looking to make your own fun, we suggest an Eco Line Rookie Stunt Kite (above), \u0026pound12.50 – perfect for the sea breeze. Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk  Its name is unusual but Wells is one of the nicest beaches the UK has to offer. A miniature railway will appeal to kids but also provides a great way to get from the town to the beach during peak season. An adventure playground will keep the little ones busy while you wait for the train. Before you leave the car though, make sure you install the Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield, \u0026pound7.99 – it will help keep the temperature in your car down while it\u0027s parked in the coastal sun. Wells-next-the-Sea beach is part of the Holkham Estate and the nearby nature reserve consists of nearly 10,000 acres. There\u0027s loads of important nature here, with salt marshes, sand dunes and pine trees – originally planted to help protect the dunes.  Pack the Halfords Beach Hut 4 Pole Compact Windbreak (above), \u0026pound45 - it\u0027s perfect for carrying to the beach as it comes in a short carry bag with each pole in three sections ready the snap together. Kynance Cove, Cornwall  Kynance Cove isn’t the biggest beach that Cornwall has to offer, but the giant rocks that pepper the beach and caves worn into the rock by the turquoise sea make it well worth a visit. There are cliff walks all around the area, too.  A day on the beach, walking and exploring, can be thirsty work. The Halfords 40 Litre Mains and 12V \u0026amp 24V Electric Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (shown above) is easy to lug about thanks to durable wheels and a pull out handle.  The coolbox is able to cool up to 16 degrees C below the ambient temperature ensuring that your drinks and snacks are kept cool even on a warm day. It can be powered either from 240V mains or by a 12V in-car or 24v in-truck cigarette plug.  Durdle Door Beach, Dorset  The Jurassic Coast is a stretch of Dorset and Devon that has 185 million years of geological history. The first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton was found there my Mary Anning and her brother Joseph – she found the torso after he had found the skull a year previously. If your kids are into dinosaurs and natural history, this is the place to visit. Durdle Door Beach offers views of the famous limestone arch just off the coast. The beach itself is accessed by a fairly challenging set of stairs cut into the cliff, so bear in mind it won\u0027t be suitable for very young children or pushchairs. Consider Lulworth Cove instead, if you\u0027re worried about the tricky climb down. Whitby Beach and Sandsend, Yorkshire  A beautifully clean beach that\u0027s easily accessible for families. Walk around 2.5miles up Whitby Beach and it’ll become the slightly quieter Sandsend. There are lifeguards here in the peak season and the sand makes it ideal for little ones to paddle and explore. The promenade features colourful beach huts and gives a handy walkway if the tide is in. There are plenty of places to eat, too.  Whitby is also credited with giving Captain Cook his love of the sea, after he moved to the town to be an apprentice to coal shipping seaman John Walker. Take the Urban Escape Folding Chair (above) - now half price at \u0026pound20 and on offer at two for \u0026pound30 - which is perfect for relaxing in as the waves lap the shore. St Andrews West Sands, Scotland    Stunning views and Scotland\u0027s famous architecture are all on display around St Andrews and its beautiful beach. A ruined castle is nearby, to give you something else to explore if you want a break from games on the beach and the natural beauty of this amazing coastline. St Andrews is, of course, famous for being the home of golf. It also houses one of the UK\u0027s best universities. Famously, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met at St Andrews. Your beach walk may well have been one that the young couple enjoyed themselves as students.  Keeping food and drink cool at the beach in summer is a challenge. The Halfords Stripe Cool Bag (above) - now half price at \u0026pound7.50 - will help keep everything fresh until lunch. Mellon Udrigle, Scotland  Worth a visit for the name alone, Mellon Udrigle offers the advantages of the Scottish Highlands and might be a nice break from the summer heatwave. Temperatures in Mellon tend to be a lot lower than most of the UK, so it makes a lot of sense if you\u0027re more about dramatic beauty than sunning yourself.  Gentle dunes and grasses make a for a picturesque beach, but there are also rock pools which kids will adore. They might find crabs, starfish and all manner of other little beasts to inspect – just pop them back where you got them from! Keep your valuables dry with the OverBoard Waterproof Dry Pouch (above), from \u0026pound2.99. It\u0027s super durable and easily buckles onto your belt or bag loops, making it ideal for chilling on the beach.  Botany Bay, Kent  Something of a hidden gem, Botany Bay offers sandy beaches and plenty of exploring fun. The cliffs have smugglers’ caves cut into them, sealed up now, but worth a story or two about the days of covert contraband. Your kids will be fascinated and excited by things to see and do here. Wait for the tide to go out and you can all explore the rock pools, looking for creatures and cooling off their toes in the summer sun. Speaking of sun, you’d do well take some shade with you – particularly for the little ones in your beach party. The Halfords Infant Playshade (below), \u0026pound25, offers 50+ UV protection for children, while the Olpro Beach Hut, \u0026pound70, can keep the whole family covered on scorching days.    This picture-perfect beach is ideal for the kids to run around on. TripAdvisor named it the fourth-best beach in Europe (and the best in the UK), in 2015. The beach was used to train troops in landings during the Second World War, and you can find a memorial to the soldiers at the northern end of the beach.

Despite a healthy appetite the 11-year-old cannot put weight on his upper body. And he has been a target for cruel bullies who call him an alien, skinny or a freak. But courageous Shaun today insists: “I want people to realise I’m normal and they shouldn’t judge others by the way they look. “If people bully me or stare too much I try to act like I don’t care but it upsets me because it’s not my fault I have this.” Shaun’s condition at first baffled doctors – but after two years they diagnosed “ultra-rare” acquired partial lipodystrophy.  It means his body has a \u0026shyproblem making, using and storing fat. There are only 700 sufferers in the UK. Their life expectancy can be lower because of the risk of diabetes and kidney problems. Shaun is also one of few who don’t develop the illness at birth. It struck after his third birthday. And it’s rare for it to affect only the upper half of the body. “Having lipodystrophy makes me unique and special,” said Shaun. “But it’s bad because it stops me doing things like swimming as I’m worried about what people think about how I look.  “I love swimming but sometimes it makes me not want to go because so many people stare. “It’s also bad because of how I look and what it can do inside my body. “Because I’m so skinny my skin hurts sometimes, if it’s really hot or really cold outside.” Parents Joanne, 46, and Brian, 48, felt helpless as their little boy got thinner. Joanne said: “Shaun was bonny when he was born – \u0026shyperfect in every way. “We couldn’t believe what we were seeing. It was like I closed my eyes and my little boy had turned into an old man overnight. Suddenly he was more like a 70-year-old.  “It’s still a mystery how Shaun got \u0026shylipodystrophy. No one else in our family ever had it. They think it was viral but can’t pinpoint an exact virus or cause.” One clue is that he had chronic constipation as a baby and needed a stoma tube in his abdomen. “At every appointment I still ask doctors if there is a cure,” said Joanne. “They just say, ‘One day, we hope.’” Despite looking gaunt, Shaun is always hungry because without fat cells his body produces less of the \u0026shyhormone leptin, which tells the brain the body has had enough to eat.  Joanne said: “He’s been called things like alien, skinny or freak by children who don’t know better. “I get \u0026shystrangers \u0026shytelling me I need to feed my child, like they think I would starve him. “We went in to a shop when he was younger and the shopkeeper barked, ‘He needs feeding up, doesn’t he?’ Once a dentist cleared the room to ask me if he was anorexic. I laughed. If only he knew how much Shaun eats!” "},{"url":null,"title":"daisy jenks marries charlie van","story":"NewsDaisy Jenks marries Charlie van Straubenzee in flower-embellished wedding dress - and of course her bridal bouquet features daisiesPrince Harry was best man and Meghan Markle were both guests of the couple with van Straubenzee a childhood friend of the Duke of SussexShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter18:17, 4 AUG 2018Updated19:19, 4 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Childhood friend of Prince Harry Charlie van Straubenzee has married Daisy Jenks with the royal serving as his best man for the big day.   Bride Daisy wore a flower-embellished wedding dress for the 3.30pm service at St Mary the Virgin church in Frensham, Surrey.  And the bridal bouquet for the party and wedding videographer, of course, had to include her namesake flowers. On one of the hottest days of the year the guests were all smiles as they waited outside the church in the glorious sunshine. There was no page boys on hand to help the bride with her veil or train but she did have a troupe of young bridesmaids to offer their services should they be required.  After the ceremony, which lasted roughly 45 minutes, Charlie performed his first duty as a newlywed husband - cycling his bride off to the reception in a tricycle. Daisy, who arrived in a black 1951 Mk6 Bentley just before 3.30pm, chose the church, which was consecrated in 1239, as it was where her parents Phillip and Dixie got married and also where she was baptised. Revd Jane Walker, who led the service, said: “It was a wonderful occasion and Charlie and Daisy looked spectacularly happy. It was a great occasion.” Bride Daisy kicked off her career in 2010 when she was hired to film a wedding in Port Isaac. She is said to have gone full-time in 2011 and now has clients in Europe as well as the UK. The groom had been usher at the Duke and Duchess\u0027 wedding in Windsor in May and paid Harry the ultimate compliment by choosing him to be best man for the nuptials today. The royal connections for the happy couple run deep with his older brother Thomas being good friends with the Duke of Cambridge and also godfather to Princess Charlotte. A third Van Straubenzee brother died in 2002 aged 18 with both princes attending the funeral.

Meghan, who wore a navy fit-and-flare dress and matching hat, chatted to guests outside the church before the service got under way at 3.30pm. Harry and Mr van Straubenzee are said to have struck up a close friendship as the groom, 30, and the royal attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire together.

Chris Edwards was parachuted into the high-street chain in October to revive its fortunes. But viewers will see the founder of rival Poundland left reeling by the state of the business, owned by millionaire Aziz Tayub. In a new fly-on-the-wall Channel 4 series, Yorkshire entrepreneur Edwards, 67, finds staff stealing and workers fiddling clocking-off times. On a visit to one “boring” store he moans: “It’s a grotty old place. If there are any worse than this, then God help us.”  And he says of stock choices: “I think we will sell a lot more Diet Coke than cucumber and mint drinks. Poundstretcher has lost its way on the obvious. And until the distribution is right, we are b****cksed. If we don’t hurry up, the business is gone.” He brings in former soldier Mark Boyd to check on stock control. He sees workers stealing on CCTV. “It amazes me we don’t search them at the end of a shift,” Mark tells the documentary makers. “To me, that’s a given.” The Tayub family – who saw a \u0026pound3.4million profit turn into a \u0026pound3.5million loss in 2017 – wanted to draw on Chris’s expertise after he sold Poundworld for \u0026pound150million in 2015.

Scores of wellwishers sang ‘Happy Birthday to You’ as the Duchess of Sussex, 37 yesterday, arrived at the church in a picturesque Surrey village. Prince Harry was one of the groomsmen as pal Charlie van Straubenzee, 30, and his bride Daisy Jenks, 27, tied the knot. Harry, 33, had arrived in at St Mary the Virgin Church in Frensham, half an hour before Meghan in a white minibus alongside groom van Straubenzee and his four best men.  The Prince and Meghan, who got married in May, were among around 250 other guests, including two of Harry’s closest friends, Guy Pelly and Tom Inskip, and the Duke of Westminster. Princess Eugenie and fiance Jack Brooksbank also attended.

Wedding and party video maker Daisy, who arrived in a black 1951 Mk6 Bentley just before 3.30pm, chose the 13th Century church as it was where her parents married and also where she was baptised. Prince Andrew previously attended a wedding there in the 1990s.  Rose Farquhar, Prince William’s first girlfriend, sang two solos during the signing of the register – including Ave Maria and Can’t Help Falling in Love by Elvis Presley. The Rev Jane Walker, who led the hour-long service, said: “Charlie and Daisy looked spectacularly happy.” Harry and the groom, who works for an investment firm, met while attending Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire.

Dom Mee, 47, spent years in the Royal Marines after leaving school but struggled to adjust to civilian life on his return.  So he teamed up with former colleagues to set up Protection Vessels International Ltd, a maritime security firm which escorts super-yachts through dangerous waters.  And, after he procured an 80ft Swedish gun boat, Dom and his mates decided to embark down the Gulf of Aden into the vast Indian Ocean for one of their toughest challenges, Wales Online says.   I was annoyed at what was happening in that region — boats were being hijacked and massive amounts of ransom paid out, as was the official protocol in such situations. We were proud ex-Marines and wanted to make a difference, the father-of-three said. Somali pirates earned hundreds of millions of dollars from hijackings during their peaks of activity between 2008 and 2012. And Dom, who had grown up near rural Denbigh, north Wales, wanted to tackle this head on. He added: The EU Navy’s directive was catch and release — meaning that if they apprehended hijackers all they’d do is confiscate their weapons and send them on their way, giving them enough fuel to get home. That’s like two guys doing a drive-by shooting in Pontypridd and the police taking their guns, slapping their wrist and gifting them a McDonald’s voucher each.  We got called cowboys by some, but nothing could be further from the truth. Far from inflaming the piracy problem, our involvement was tackling it head on — and not a moment too soon, as organised crime syndicates from the mainland were starting to get involved as there was clearly a lot of money to be made. Whenever a ship approached us we’d fire a flare to say we’d seen them — and if they kept coming after that we’d let off a few warning shots. We’d use tracer bullets that lit up red when fired, so there was no doubt about whether they’d clocked them or not. And, if they continued to proceed toward us after that, then it was probably safe to assume they weren\u0027t collecting for the Red Cross. Mohamed Abdi Hassan, aka Big Mouth, was a Somali entrepreneur and diplomat who bankrolled a pirate fleet from behind the scenes. He was on board a ship. Meanwhile, Mohamed Abdi Garaad, a former fisherman-turned-hijacker who served as Hassan’s attack dog and became Dom’s seafaring nemesis, was also masterminding the hijackings. And Garaad was behind Dom\u0027s closest shave, a night-time raid on a ship he was guarding where a rocket-propelled grenade was fired into the funnel stack, almost blowing up some of his team.  Dom, who now has three children, continued: Their mothership had been sunk by the Russians so they didn’t have enough fuel to get back – so for them it was hijack or die. But he managed to get both a spotlight and his gun\u0027s sights fixed on the raiders just as they attached their ladder to the side of his vessel. He was an elusive guy, but when he hijacked a UK ship called Asian Glory off the Horn of Africa in 2010, the plan was for me to go on board to drop off the money and get photographic proof the hostages were still alive,” added Dom. “More importantly, I just wanted to look him in the eye, you know see the man in the flesh finally. “However, Garaad’s pirate enclave was hit by Islamic militants shortly before the drop was due to happen and everyone got really freaked out. “As a result the money got delivered by air instead, so as to avoid any potential fire fights. In the case of Big Mouth, though, he was undone by his own ego. “Interpol set up a fake film production company and told him they wanted to make a documentary about his life. So he flew to Belgium to meet them in 2013 and – BOOM! He’s still in jail there as we speak.  And it was after Garaad’s departure that Dom decided to quit the armed escort game. “That was a big moment for me, the war felt over,” he says, adding that he\u0027s relocated to Sri Lanka, where he embarked on the new adventure of being dad to three young children, as well as renting out a number of luxury coastal villas to visiting tourists. Although, as he admits, the buzz of that former life of daring will never leave him completely. For now, I have a simple life and it\u0027s the first time in a long time I\u0027ve felt like a civilian. It\u0027s kind of nice to be normal again.

Boyfriend Charlie Rowley, 45, found it in the park on June 29 and gave it to her as a gift. Forensic teams have discovered low-level contamination in toilets in the city\u0027s Queen Elizabeth Gardens.   A source told The Sun : “Novichok is a liquid agent made of two components.  “The toilets in Queen Elizabeth Gardens are a key location where it could have been mixed, prepared or dumped. “It’s chilling and definitely a line of inquiry.” Ex-spy Sergei, 67, and daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, fell critically ill on March 3 after they touched Novichok that had been smeared on their front door handle.  Both managed to survive. Sergei has not been seen in public since the assassination attempt - which Russia has strenuously denied any involvement in. A spokesman for the politan Police told the paper said: “The investigation is ongoing. We are not prepared to discuss any lines of inquiry.” Last month Ms Sturgess was laid to rest. Mr Rowley attended the service which began with the James Blunt song \u0027Beautiful Dawn\u0027.

Which makes the behaviour of her replacement Sajid Javid all the more shocking. Because it came to light this week that his Home Office is raking in millions charging the children of immigrants more than \u0026pound1,000 each to get the citizenship they are entitled to by right. This blatant profiteering has made the Government a fortune while driving families into debt. The charity Citizens UK says parents are taking on second jobs and going without food to scrape together the \u0026pound1,012 fee.  And if parents can’t find the money – a huge bill for many \u0026shyimmigrant families – then their \u0026shychildren are denied things that should be theirs by right, such as further education, student loans and the chance to travel abroad. It is almost 10 times what France and Spain charge and represents a profit of more than \u0026pound600 per child. The actual admin cost is less than \u0026pound400. These are children born in the UK or who have spent most of their lives here. By any definition, they are British. Citizenship is their right. OK, it’s fair people should pay something. Public services have been cut to the bone and there isn’t much money in the coffers. Members of my own family quite rightly forked out citizenship fees to be naturalised after living here for 10 years.

And the revelation explodes the vile lies of racist groups who have tried to exploit the vulnerable young victims in a bid to stir up hatred and fear. Because the Sunday Mirror investigation which exposed the town’s child sex scandal has uncovered a raft of Asian victims – who have kept quiet to save their families being shunned. One said of the exploitation of the scandal by far-right racists: “It makes me feel girls like me don’t matter, that we haven’t suffered too.” Experts now say the true scale of the crime, uncovered by this paper four months ago, may never be known – and that the girls’ silence could help some perpetrators to evade justice. We revealed in March how up to 1,000 victims may have been groomed in the Shropshire town during a horrifying 40-year campaign of abuse. Five deaths were linked to the shocking epidemic, including the mother and sister of one of the girls, killed alongside her in an arson attack.  Until now, the abuse victims had been understood to be almost entirely white girls preyed on by Asian gangs. But we have spoken to a number from both Indian and Pakistani backgrounds who were also targeted. Some said they still cannot bring themselves to talk to police because they fear judgment and retribution. One, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, told us: “The first time I was raped, I was only 11. I didn’t even know what sex was. “I went from being an angel child to staying in bed, wanting to die. “I’ve still never told my family. If I did, my dad wouldn’t be able to show his face in the mosque. “It doesn’t just happen to white girls, it happens to us too.”  Child abuse campaigners fear the horror is being exploited by far-right groups for their own ends. A string of extremist marches have been held in the town since our 18-month probe exposed the scandal. Holly Archer, who led a campaign for a public inquiry, said: “We’re sick of our ordeals being exploited by far-right groups who don’t care about us, but about their own racist agenda. “I’ve spoken to several girls from Asian communities who have felt unable to come forward. Children from all backgrounds can be sexually exploited, but those from ethnic minorities are far less likely to tell anyone. It’s time to stand together and show they will be supported.” Ansar Ali, of Together Against Grooming, has said there could be scores more victims. His campaign group works with Asian communities across Britain to raise awareness of child sexual exploitation. He said: “It’s no surprise to hear there are Asian victims in Telford.  “Research has shown that only around a third of victims will be represented by official figures. But women from Asian communities are far less likely to come forward.” Ansar added: “There are undoubtedly a disproportionate number of Pakistani men involved, but they have no loyalty to any one community.” Two Asian girls have told us they were targeted by street grooming gangs, and raped by multiple men throughout their teenage years. One fled Telford in terror after years of hell at the hands of serial predators. But while some of her attackers were reported to West Mercia Police as part of its 2012 Operation Chalice, which saw eight men jailed, she said some of the worst still walk free. The woman, 13 when her abuse began, told us: “The police don’t know about me, even though I was raped and abused like all my white friends. “My life was hell too, but people think these things don’t happen to girls like me because of the colour of our skin. In the end, I had to get out.” When we urged her to contact the police, she insisted: “I’ll \u0026shyprobably never tell, it would be so painful for my family.”  But when she sees far-right groups coming to Telford she feels her suffering has been ignored, that girls like her “don’t matter”. Another girl, now in her 20s, told how she was preyed on by a relative linked to a notorious group of abusers, who raped her from the age of 11. Like countless others, she was taken to local beauty spot The Wrekin, to be abused away from prying eyes. She said: “The first time, I was 11. He put the bonnet up on his car so passers-by couldn’t see. I was trembling. “I was in so much pain but I didn’t scream. I felt he’d broken me. He said to go home and bath. After that it was three or four times a week for five years.“Her abuser is now dead. Files on another girl, targeted at 15 by two suspected Asian drug dealers, show she fell pregnant four times in six years. Social services, teachers and mental health services were aware of the girl’s plight – but did not inform police. The Sunday Mirror has seen case notes that show authorities admitted failing on “concerns of physical abuse and sexual exploitation”.   Spin plea on our probe A key figure in safeguarding children in Telford attacked our investigation in the town, claiming it could stop current victims from coming forward. Andrew Mason, who chairs the area’s Safeguarding Children Board, claimed in an email our 18 months of research had been conducted “on the back of a fag packet”. He made his comments as he begged a journalist from news website The Huffington Post to write a positive story about how child sex abuse in the town was handled.  In an email seen by the Sunday Mirror under a Freedom of Information request, Mr Mason admits “terrible things happened in Telford” and “many mistakes were made in the past”. But in an astonishing outburst he added: “Perhaps as I write this a sexually abused young person in our community, plucking up the courage to come forward, might see what is being said, change their minds and say nothing.” In fact, the week we exposed the scandal more than a dozen girls told police for the first time of their abuse. Our story also prompted a public inquiry. Meanwhile Telford and Wrekin Council, led by Councillor Shaun Davies, has hired a PR expert to help revamp its image. Council officials were told the appointment of Jan Jennings would help press officers with “strategic messaging and reputational recovery.” Our shock findings force police to go after the abusers Police have launched a new probe into child sexual exploitation in Telford as a result of the Sunday Mirror’s expose. Sources in the West Mercia force have confirmed a fresh operation will focus on “non recent” cases of abuse in the Shropshire town. More than a dozen brave women came forward to tell cops about their own abuse ordeals the week after we published the shock findings of our 18-month investigation. It forced the local authority to order a public inquiry into a repeated failure by the authorities to stamp out networks of abusers who have preyed on young girls for four decades. The new police investigation has been launched to bring the perpetrators to justice. This newspaper first asked for a probe in 2016. Then 10 police and council officials wrote to the home office to say it wasn’t necessary. But in a major U-turn Labour- run Telford and Wrekin Council agreed in April to the inquiry. Independent groups have now been invited to bid for a contract to appoint a chair and set the terms of reference for the inquiry, which is expected to begin its work later this year.  Horrifying scandal unfolded over 40 years 1980s: Predatory abusers start to target vulnerable girls in Telford, picking them up on the streets and outside a children’s home. One girl falls pregnant after being abused and passed around several men, but when she tells her doctor of the abuse he dismisses her as mentally ill. 1996: A concerned resident tells police about ringleader Shahzad “Keith” Khan, whom she suspects of abusing and selling Telford teenagers. She says her claims were not followed up. Late 1990s: Social workers become aware of the abuse, but a council-commissioned report later claims they failed to act because they did not understand the problem.  2000: Lucy Lowe, 16, is killed in a house fire set by cabbie Azhar Ali Mehmood, now 44, who made her pregnant at just 14. Lucy’s mum and sister also die. Mehmood was later jailed for life for the murders. Another schoolgirl tells murder cops that Mehmood groomed her too, but no abuse probe is launched. 2002: Becky Watson, 13, dies in a car accident described as “a prank”. Tragic diaries reveal Becky had endured two years of rape hell prior to her death. 2009: Becky’s friend Vicky Round dies, aged 20, in a drugs incident. Her family say grooming gangs got her hooked on crack at 12 and heroin at 14. 2013: The police’s Operation Chalice, which identified 200 men suspected of raping young Telford girls, produces just eight convictions. August 2016: The Sunday Mirror reports that the exploitation problem is continuing outside underage discos in the town, and that cops have failed to log abuse reports from concerned street pastors. September 2016: Telford’s Tory MP Lucy Allan asks PM Theresa May to launch an independent inquiry into abuse in Telford. Ten police and council officials tell the Home Office a probe is not needed.  March 2018: The Sunday Mirror publishes the results of its 18-month investigation into child sexual exploitation in Telford, which links five deaths to the abuse and reveals there could be up to 1,000 victims over four decades. Our story prompts more than a dozen girls to go to police. April 2018: Telford councillors vote unanimously to commission an independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation following our revelations. June 2018: Telford and Wrekin Council invites independent bodies to apply to commission a chair for the inquiry, expected to start in the autumn.

According to the Met Office, temperatures will soar past 30C (85F) in parts of the UK and the warm weather will continue into next week. The hottest areas today are expected to be around London and stretching north to the midlands. Sun-lovers hitting the beaches on England\u0027s south coast on Saturday felt the brunt of the heat, with a peak temperature of 29.8C (85.64F) reached at Gosport, Hampshire.  Britons soaking up the weekend rays were urged to stay sun sensible amid the high UV levels. Temperatures could soar even higher early next week, with highs of 33C (89.6F) possible in parts of the south east on Tuesday. South Lincolnshire and the north of Norfolk are predicted to experience the hottest conditions.  However, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies - in Scotland and Northern Ireland clouds are likely with some thick enough to bring patchy rain from the west. The north-west, south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales are to stay generally dry and warmer, with the exception of possible thunderstorms across the south east on Tuesday.  Temperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England\u0027s current August record - 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003. However, the intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday. Forecaster Dean Hall said there will be quite a marked change to the feel of things from the middle of the week as conditions turn fresher and more changeable.  It is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, he said, with no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days. It comes amid a sweltering European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the sun most intensely. The mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert.  British holiday-makers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. Earlier this week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal. Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country, with thermometers passing 46C (114.8F) on Saturday.

Ebony Hutt gave birth to Rae Ebony Ann Hooper with sister Lauren Hooper, her husband Michael and her own partner Gavin Leech at her side. The 6lb 12oz baby was passed straight into Lauren’s arms after Michael cut the umbilical cord. Lauren, 31 said: “It felt like a dream. We’d been picturing that moment for four years, and she was finally there.” Rae was born after a difficult 12-hour labour when doctors discovered she was in the breech position. But after medical checks, the proud couple were allowed to take Rae home later that day and Ebony, 35, was discharged from hospital. Lauren said: “Our whole family was waiting to meet Rae. It was so special.  “Her cousins – Ebony and Gavin’s kids Tegan, nine and Sonny, six – got to meet her first. They’ve always known this is their little cousin.” The sisters, of Okehampton, Devon, have now begun the legal process to make Lauren and Michael Rae’s official parents. Ebony is still expressing milk to feed Rae, which Gavin, 41, delivers daily. Ebony said: “Having Lauren, Michael and Gavin there for support at the birth was amazing. We did a lot of laughing and that’s what got me through.  “This has always been their baby and I’ve always known that. The minute she was born, I just wanted her to be with them. Seeing her with them was so special – it’s what I always wanted. “We’ll always have a special bond but I’m just enjoying being her auntie.” Lauren and Michael, 36, were devastated to learn in 2014 that her childhood heart problems meant carrying a baby could be fatal for her and the child.

This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b641f2320425-848x564.jpg ","title":"kyle falconer kicks off solo tour in dundee proving the view frontman is a big success","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKyle Falconer has kicked off his first solo tour with a performance in Dundee – and he did it with a bang.There was a capacity crowd and a muggy atmosphere at Ward Road venue Church on Thursday night as The View frontman belted out his newest tunes in style.The Dryburgh star’s debut solo album No Thank You was released just a week ago and already the crowd could chant back every word of each song.The album was recorded in Paul Weller’s Black Barn studio in Surrey last year and was produced by Falconer on his own for the first time.Before the main act appeared, Kyle was supported by three local acts.First up was Kyle’s life-long friend Billy Mitchell, whose set included crowd favourites Losing Control and his newest single Psycho.Electro pop band Echo Machine was next.The gig was a family affair with Kyle’s brother Ronnie Falconer and his band Th13ves taking on the role of main support.No Thank You reached number 16 in the UK midweek charts following its release with fans praising the record for showing off Kyle’s voice.Kyle previously revealed that Liam Gallagher chose the title of his new solo album while the pair were on holiday together.The singer said that its name was selected by friend and former Oasis frontman while they were on holiday with their partners in Thailand last January.Kyle will continue the celebration of his album tonight in Aberdeen. He heads across the border in September to Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds.Hats Off To The Buskers was the first of The View’s five albums and featured anthems like Wasted Little DJs, Superstar Tradesman and Skag Trendy, the video for which was filmed near the homes of the band members in Dryburgh.The album went platinum after selling around 319,000 copies in 2007.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"major retail and housing development for local area hangs in balance","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMulti-million-pound plans for a major development including more than 400 homes are hanging in the balance.Up to 420 homes, a business park, food and non-food retail units and a creche form the ambitious masterplan for Westwood Park in Glenrothes.Planning permission in principle was granted three years ago and a section 75 legal agreement suggested developers should pay £3,300 per housing unit towards infrastructure costs.However, a snag has now emerged after agents acting for developer Landteam Scotland called on Fife Council to reduce the sum being sought towards transportation improvements.Shepherd and Wedderburn has written to the local authority arguing a change in planning guidance since means there is “no longer any justification in policy or guidance” for that level of payment – arguing the figure should be revised down to £1,302 per dwelling.Kevin Treadwell service manager at Fife Council, said: “As the development has not yet commenced, the developers of Westwood Park have applied to revise their legal agreement so that their contributions are aligned to the most up-to-date guidance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new striker adil nabi in dundee squad for st mirren opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew signing Adil Nabi goes straight into the Dundee squad for today\u0026#8217s Premiership opener at St Mirren.The 24-year-old will likely have to settle for a place on the bench, however.Coming back into the team will be star midfielder Glen Kamara after he shrugged off an ankle injury picked up in training last week.The Finnish international missed wins at Peterhead and home to Brechin but is expected to return.Striker Sofien Moussa, too, is expected to have got over his rib injury he suffered against Dunfermline.The Tunisian was given painkilling injections to get through the game at Balmoor but wasn’t able to play against Brechin.There are still question marks over the fitness of central defender Genseric Kusunga.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"only five players remain from when mccann took charge but dundee far from the finished article","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than a year into the job and with plenty of players in and out, Dundee boss Neil McCann is beginning to feel this squad is his own, though he admits they’re “far from the finished article”.Only five first-team players remain since Neil took the reins at Dens Park in June 2017 – Cammy Kerr, Darren O’Dea, Paul McGowan, Jesse Curran and Craig Wighton.After two summer windows – still four weeks to go in the current one – and a winter transfer period, it’s clear the Dens gaffer has put his own stamp on the side, though he admits he’s still got work to do on that front.He said: “The squad has evolved since I came in.“A lot of those boys that were here when I came in served me great.“When I’ve asked them to come in and do a job, they gave me everything but a lot of those boys have decided, when they’re not featuring regularly, they want to move on, and have.“I’m still looking to bring in some more but I’m pleased with the group I have just now.“You want to mould a team and how it wants to play and it has to be your team – there’s no point coming in and trying to use the previous manager’s ideas and ways he wants to play, it has to be your own.“I’m getting to the stage where I’m seeing things coming, but we need to bolt lots together because we’re far from the finished article.”Neil has been clear in his pursuit of further options at left-back and up front.Former Morton defender Mark Russell is in on trial along with former West Brom forward Adil Nabi.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b641fc89a99f-e1533298226211.jpg ","title":"today

on a rather unusual venture at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.To celebrate his 13th year as a Fringe performer, Bruce is not only performing comedy but also taking comedy fans on a sightseeing tour of all places Shakespeare in Tayside.Following on from the success of his Macbeth-themed show at last year’s Fringe, Bruce is ferrying people around to places such as Dunsinane Hill near Collace and going from Birnam Wood to Dunsinane in Highland Perthshire.It all means a rather hectic next month for Bruce.He is performing his latest show at The Beehive in Edinburgh at 9.30pm nightly then, once he comes off stage, he will get some sleep before driving folk around Perth the following day, arriving back in Edinburgh just in time to go on stage again.Bruce, 53, who brought Kevin Bridges, Sarah Millican and Paul Sinnha from The Chase to his comedy clubs in Dundee and Perth, said: “My Fringe comedy show last year was all about Macbeth and I thought it would be a novel idea to take people to places where Macbeth walked and which are integral to his story.“I will be doing this during the duration of my show which lasts from tomorrow until August 22.“It means some very long days and nights but I am looking forward to it.“I will be on the go for a considerable amount of time.”Bruce is something of a veteran at one of the world’s most famous comedy events.He has performed to thousands at the Fringe and taken his past shows on tour.He has taken his brand of wit to Australia, New Zealand, Africa and the Far East as well as venues all over Britain.Bruce, a former physics teacher at Brechin High School, is also a former UK Speakers’ Club Speaker of the Year.The former Perth High pupil is also a highly-acclaimed entertainer at Burns’ Suppers and is mulling over an invite to officiate at one in Canada next year.But right now, he is concentrating on his arduous Fringe stint.“I hope the audience will get as much fun out of it as I will,” he

park.The area will be created at Gillies Park, with work expected to start on August 13.The games area will be built on the former tennis courts, on the south side of the park.Plans include a playground space for different activities as well as basketball hoops and goal posts.The facility is expected to be similar to a games area created at Baxter Park in Stobswell in 2014, which cost £187,000.Details of the project were first revealed by Broughty Ferry councillor Kevin Cordell in 2017.He said: “The community has worked very hard for this and I was happy to facilitate meetings with officers and elected members throughout the process.“I know the multi-use games area will be a welcome addition to the local community and will encourage more children to enjoy the park, in safety.“The fantastic proposals are testament to the determination of the local community and council officers.”As part of the Dundee Decides initiative, which saw residents across the city decide how £1.2 million would be spent through the community infrastructure fund, extra lighting will also be installed along the pathways in the park.The Broughty Ferry ward voted to spend £25,000 of its budget allocation on lighting the paths.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “We’re committed to improving our parks, play equipment and providing new spaces for communities.“We invest hundreds of thousands of pounds every year to make that a reality and I’m pleased that we have been able to work on delivering the Gillies Park multi-use games area.“These are really exciting proposals that are important to making the Ferry look and feel more attractive, while also making Gillies Park safer by installing lighting around the park.”Over the last five years, Barnhill Tenants’ and Residents’ Association has been trying to improve Gillies Park.The group secured £70,000 of funding from the council’s neighbourhood services towards the multi-use games area.A sub-group made up of members of the association carried out door-to-door canvassing in the community to find out if residents would support the project.It started campaigning for the multi-use games area to be created two years ago and today welcomed the successful planning bid.Audrey Murphy, who was chairwoman of the association during the fundraising campaign, said: “We are very grateful for the support we received from Barnhill Primary School, local councillors, former councillor Laurie Bidwell and members of the sub-committee.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

I fear this is only the beginning.”Isla McGlade, interim associate nurse director for mental health and learning disability services, said 22 newly qualified nurses will join the hospital in October.She added: “While this is an enormous boost, these new recruits will need support as they settle into their first job after graduation.“In the short term we are working with nursing agencies to recruit appropriately trained staff as soon as possible to cover from now until the newly qualified nurses are settled.“However, this still leaves us with more than 30 vacancies.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"university takes part in healthy eating research","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university has teamed-up with two other research institutes to look at Scotland’s dietary goals.Research by Robert Gordon, Abertay and Newcastle universities has shown that the country’s national diet and health has not improved in the past 15 years.The study, which was funded by Food Standards Scotland, looked at annual trends in food intake between 2013 and 2015, compared to 2001 to 2012. The universities were looking to monitor Scotland’s progress towards the Scottish Dietary Goals.It found that the country’s intake of fruit and vegetables, oil-rich fish, and dietary fibre is too low, with free sugars and fat being too high.Dr Lindsey Masson, a nutrition lecturer at Robert Gordon University and registered nutritionist, acted as Principal Investigator for the study.She said: “In Scotland, 65% of adults are overweight and 29% of adults are obese. Therefore, it is essential that we start to reduce our consumption of foods that are high in sugar and fat – namely biscuits, confectionery, crisps, cakes, pastries, puddings and sugar-sweetened drinks.\u0026#8220In addition to raising awareness of the health benefits of meeting dietary recommendations, the Scottish Government needs to support the population in achieving these dietary goals.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"young farmers charity efforts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Aberdeen branch of a young farmers’ association is aiming to raise cash for charity as part of an initiative covering the north of ScotlandThe north region of the Scottish Association of Young Farmers’ Clubs (SAYFC) has launched a fundraising drive to raise £16,000 for youth charities.The bid is the group’s challenge the north campaign.The 2018/19 challenge is being held in connection with the Year of Young People.Across the north, each of the region’s seven districts – from Orkney in the north to Aberdeen and Kincardine in the south – is aiming to raise £2,000 for their chosen charities.The challenge was launched on Friday evening on social media.The SAYFC north region committee is also hoping to raise a further £2,000 and this will be split among the region’s chosen charities.SAYFC north region chairman Michael Gunn said the fundraising goals had been set to coincide with 2018 being the Year of Young People.He added: “SAYFC has always encouraged its members to be active citizens within the local community and I feel that this is a very important part of what makes Young Farmers great.

However, the development fee the Dons will have to pay Hamilton for Turf Moor goal hero Ferguson will be decided by an SPFL tribunal on August 21.In contrast, Rangers have splashed in excess of £5 million this summer in a bid to overtake the Reds, who finished Premiership runners-up.McInnes reckons this has prompted many pundits to predict the Ibrox club will overtake them in Scotland’s pecking order – especially in light of the Glasgow outfit’s dealings in the transfer market.He has other ideas.McInnes said: “If you listen to what everyone else is saying, that we are going to be this and that and we are going to finish here in the league and we need this player or we need that player.“However, there is enough here, in personality and confidence, within that team to suggest to me that we are going to have a good season.“We will try to bring good reinforcements in but the squad is strong and we aim to show that this season.”There is no better arena to show that in than a season opener against Rangers.Ultimately, it is just three points – the season will not be defined by this game – but a win could certainly represent an early marker and statement of intent.Last season Aberdeen took just one point from 12 against a Rangers side beset by problems behind the scenes.“When you saw the ovation from the supporters at the end (of the Burnley tie), it was not just in recognition of the players’ efforts and quality of performance,” he said.“It was also that they see, something in this squad they can be excited about for the season ahead.“And there is no better game to try to get off (to a good start) and feel better about ourselves than by winning against Rangers.“That will be tough but it is a brilliant game to be involved in and may be just the perfect game after the disappointment of losing to Burnley.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mckenna good enough to star in england","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSkipper Graeme Shinnie has no doubt wanted man Scott McKenna could cut it not just in the Championship but the English top flight – although he hopes the defender stays at Pittodrie.Swansea have already approached Aberdeen to inquire about the availability of the 21-year-old centre-back.The Championship outfit are lining up a £2 million bid for the Scotland international before the transfer window closes in England on August 9.McKenna will face Rangers in the Premiership opener at Pittodrie tomorrow as the Reds aim to bounce back from their Euro exit.Aberdeen suffered massive disappointment when losing 3-1 after extra-time to Burnley at Turf Moor to exit the Europa League 4-2 on aggregate.Shinnie reckons the way McKenna shackled the Clarets big-money strikers, including £15m signing Chris Wood, proves he can hack it in England’s top flight.He only hopes that move comes a long way down the line and that tomorrow’s clash with Rangers at Pittodrie is not McKenna’s last for the Reds.Shinnie said: “Scott McKenna and Mikey Devlin were brilliant again in what was a tough task with the physicality of the two Burnley boys up front.\u0026#8220But they dealt with it brilliantly and that gave us the platform in the game.“Scott could go to a Premier League team (in the future), as he showed what he can do against a Premier League team in Burnley.“However, he is a level-headed guy as well and wants to rack up as many games as he can, which is really positive for a young player.\u0026#8220He wants to get the experience and wants to get the games.“There is no doubt he will probably end up going at some point but we will hold on to him as long as we can.”Aberdeen rejected an offer in excess of £1 million from Hull City for Scotland cap McKenna during the January transfer window. Since then he has made his international breakthrough and captained Scotland in a 1-0 summer friendly loss to Mexico.McKenna will be at the heart of the defence in a game against Rangers that marks new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard’s first domestic game.After the disappointment of losing at Turf Moor, skipper Shinnie challenged the Reds to bounce back with a victory.He said: “Pittodrie will be packed for Rangers and it is a good game to have off the back of the Euro tie.“We need to put that (loss to Burnley) at the back of our minds.“It is a massive game but that is what it is like at Aberdeen – big games come thick and fast.“We know the crowd will be there in their numbers so it is another game where we have to step it up.”Aberdeen were up against a side with an immensely superior budget in Burnley, who have a £37m players’ wage budget.Tomorrow the figures may be smaller but there is still a gulf between the budget of Rangers and that of Aberdeen.The Ibrox club have backed Gerrard’s rebuilding by sanctioning transfers in excess of £5m during the summer.There have also been high-profile loan deals that will require high wages.Shinnie does not care about the cash the Ibrox club are splashing out, though.On the disparity between the two club’s budgets, he said: “That is out of our control and we just focus on ourselves.“The games against Burnley have been positive for us and we look to take that momentum into the league.”Aberdeen may have been knocked out of Europe but Shinnie reckons they regained some pride for Scottish football.It is a tie he believes the Dons deserved to win over the two legs to book a third qualifying round clash against Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey.He said: “In Scotland teams know what we are all about – we have proved that over the last couple of years.“Maybe we have now shown people down in England what Scottish football is all about.“It is not as bad as what the English make it out to be.“But in Scotland, in terms of us, we have shown what we are all about.“We have got a big season ahead of us again to show that.”Aberdeen may have been underdogs against Premier League Burnley but, make no mistake, there was a belief in this squad they could progress.It was this confidence which made losing out in extra time all the more difficult to take for the Aberdonian, particularly as the Reds had opportunities to win the tie.He said: “We are gutted that we did not get through because that is what we wanted and what we set out to achieve.“No matter who it was against, we wanted to get through and we had the opportunities to do that.“It is disappointing but we will take the positives.“We can be proud of what we did… but it wasn’t good enough.“At the start of the game Burnley were good, although we didn’t start great in the first half.“Once we got to grips with the game, we got right into it.“In the second half, again, we didn’t start overly great but went on to be the better team and create the better chances.I thought, over the two legs, we were probably the better team but we didn’t take our chances and, in the end, that kills you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"turning a profit with added value wind turbines","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/07/18, 6:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowRegular artistic contributor Ann Thomas from Tarbert this week turns her imagination to the growing presence of wind turbines in our countryside around Argyll.Ann muses that they might be turned into tourist attractions along the lines of the London Eye, with the speed of rotation determined by the vagaries of the weather.Could this be a potential source of added value and extra cash for our community wind turbines?\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 1:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On the afternoon of July 2, my car overturned in Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig.Fortunately, I was not injured but I would like to thank the emergency services \u0026#8211 ambulance and police \u0026#8211 neighbours and workmen who pulled me out of the car after smashing the glass.Everyone was so helpful.I didn’t get your names but appreciate your help.We have a wonderful community here in Argyll.Anne Lavelle, Ardrishaig.Sir,I would like to thank everyone who made last Friday\u0026#8217s quiz night in aid of the Lochgilphead Celtic and Pictish Festival such a success.Thanks to Stan at the Stag Hotel for providing the room and a round of drinks for the winners.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13025651.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_300718ayr.jpg","title":"ayr united daft musician set","story":"NewsAyr United-daft musician set to donate cash raised from song to clubHonest Man Jason Skimming, who fronts the Seaside Sons, is getting prepared to hear his band’s new song United With Pride being belted out against Partick Thistle.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet10:11, 3 AUG 2018NewsSeaside Sons (Image: unknown handout)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Ayr-daft musician is giving something back to his beloved team.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields two things must","story":"NewsBob Shields: Two things must happen at the Station HotelEmergency committee must be set upShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning07:00, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“Ding dong . . . this is a Scot Rail passenger announcement . . . the next arrival at platforms one, two, three and four will be the 2018 death of Ayr Station. “This is due to Ayr Station Hotel deteriorating on South Ayrshire Council’s doorstep and no heads being on the line. “We apologise for any inconvenience and the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds of your money. “The next train from a functional Ayr Station will the 2020 to Glasgow Central”. Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them.

Workers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers. The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable. And it had to happen on what seems like one of the busiest days of the year. “There are other Morrisons in Troon and Kilmarnock, you would think they could get an emergency supply from them, but apparently not.” The bustling store in the town’s Castlehill Road stopped selling 5p bags in a bid to go green and re-use the stronger 10p bags. A Morrisons spokeswoman said: “Due to a higher than normal demand one day this week, our Ayr store ran out of 10p bags. They have received a delivery since.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSupermarketsAyrKilmarnockTroonAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic ban town square cumnock","story":"NewsTraffic ban in Town Square in CumnockFears over congestion in nearby roadsShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:05, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailConcerns have been raised about traffic chaos when cars are banned from the Town Square in Cumnock. But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented. He added: “Who is going to patrol it? “Will it be police or traffic wardens. “I haven’t seen police in the square.” Stewart Turner, head of road at Ayrshire Roads Alliance, said: “Access to The Square will be limited to vehicles directly associated with wedding and funeral operations at Old Cumnock Old Church. “These vehicles will be required to display a permit to access The Square. Permits are available free of charge from the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. “We have contacted several wedding and funeral operators in the immediate area and advised of this requirement. “Exemptions to the access restriction include vehicles engaged in building work, road repairs, utility repairs, postal delivery, cash collection, furniture removal operations and the emergency services. “The Square will also have waiting and loading restrictions in force at all times. This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

Well for many years, I have been in the privileged position of trying and testing the world\u0026rsquos best beauty products in the name of journalism. And so everywhere I go, women of colour are ALWAYS asking me for my beauty recommendations. There is a lack of representation (In magazines, in campaigns, in product ranges etc etc) And while there is progress, I have regular experiences that remind me there is still work to be done. Also despite the plethora of beauty boxes out there, I hadn\u0026rsquot come across one that actually includes this demographic \u0026#128580. So I wanted to do something that in a small way celebrates great brands and products that actually take a range of skin tones and ethnicities into consideration. The @esteelaudercompanies have long been genuine and authentic in their pursuit of inclusivity \u0026ndash long before it became a fashionable buzz word- and so it has been such a pleasure to collaborate with them on this box. \u0026#128131\u0026#127999\u0026#128131\u0026#127999\u0026#128131\u0026#127999(I\u0026rsquom dancing a lot just in case you hadn\u0026rsquot noticed) So to the contents \u0026ndash @bobbibrownuk Crushed Lip Colour, @esteelauderuk Pure Color Envy Lash Multi Effects, @originsuk GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream, @cliniqueuk Even Better Dark Spot Corrector, @maccosmeticsuk Prep and Prime @darphin Hydra Skin Light, @avedauk Be Curky Curl Enhancer and @cliniqueuk Cheek Pop .

communities, while ELC keeps an eye on the return of Russian, Brazilian and Nigerian tourists to the UK.\nELC prepares for inbound tourists with monthly flight reports, that helps staff understand

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter safety first and cycling","story":"We totally agree with Jan McCorkindale’s  remarks regarding the  road signage and safety of cyclists on the A83 and all associated roads.Being regular users of these roads it is apparent that many cyclists refrain from wearing high visibility clothing and, also more significantly, do not use helmets for adults or children.As a sport cycling is becoming more popular.Perhaps cycling clubs and parents should be more vigilant to ensure use of these items before allowing anyone to use busy roads.Ann and Tom Campbell,Macharioch Shore and Motherwell.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"restored ring netter jasper chugs on","story":"Originally ring netter, Jasper, powered by, what is now a rare Gardner 6L3b 18.103 litre diesel engine developing 172 bhp at 1150 rpm, was built by A Noble and Sons for M and E McDonald and launched on March 4 1968.The 59.5 foot fishing boat worked first as SY 379 \u0026#8216Santa Maria III\u0026#8217 at Erisay until renamed, possibly by Cubblie McKinnon,  the \u0026#8216Fair Mourn\u0026#8217 at Dunure and was  renamed a third time as\u0026#8217Misty Morn\u0026#8217 SY 529, before being sold out of fishing in 2008.The Courier understands Jasper was restored in Rothesay.All photographs by Ged Connelly.Archie Loch Park Paterson in Jasper\u0026#8217s wheelhouse.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.

He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.  The outlet is run by Gibraltar-born Arcon Patron.  He said: \u0026ldquoI have been in Edinburgh for nearly 20 years and now live in Musselburgh. So far this year I have passed my driving test, bought my first car, moved house, opened my first business and am getting married.  \u0026ldquoI was looking to open my own place, partly because I wanted to be my own boss and partly because I wanted to explore more.  \u0026ldquoI have had several people approach me over the years to invest in me, so I eventually took the plunge.  His partner in the business is John Edmonds, who opened Fat Sam\u0026rsquos restaurant in Fountainbridge in 1986.  Mr Patron said working in the old Tolbooth was special as he loved history. He said: \u0026ldquoThis building is fantastic.  In keeping with the building\u0026rsquos heritage, he is displaying coffee related antiques in the shop, including a 200-year-old coffee roaster and, to mark a forthcoming golf exhibition in nearby Musselburgh Museum, is hoping to exhibit and sell golf prints.  \u0026ldquoOnce we are up and running we are going to devote a wall to local artists to exhibit their work. The gallery is going to be a big aspect of it, he added.

Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.  But while Musselburgh\u0026rsquos research showed a high number of off-sales operating in the town, in North Berwick the map was red because of the number of licensed premises such as restaurants and pubs.  A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.  However, it also revealed that, in general, the county performed far better than Scotland\u0026rsquos national average when it came to alcohol-related health harm and crime.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

ELC, which owns brands like Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown, DKNY, MAC and Tom Ford, has described the UK consumer base is one of the most diverse in the world, with ethnic consumers currently making up 14% of the population but driving 80% of population growth.  Catering to a wider demographic has meant recruiting customer-facing beauty advisers who speak a total of 70 different languages between them, and introducing private consultation areas that can make makeup application easier for women donning religious head wear.  \u0026ldquoWe do an enormous amount of work behind the scenes\u0026hellipon understanding different cultures, in the way they like to be serviced, on the respect that you need to have around certain holidays, and that is hugely important to our business, she said.  ELC has now been tapping into demand for beauty products around key cultural holidays including Ramadan and China\u0026rsquos Golden Week.  In the two weeks leading up to Ramadan, during which many Middle Eastern consumers shop in the UK before returning home for the holy month, retail sales of ELC\u0026rsquos UK brands surged 74% in Harrods alone.

During Golden Week, a product like La Mer saw sales rise 44%.  \u0026ldquoAround Chinese Golden Week, a brand like La Mer would have specific wrapping, to help celebrate that year in Chinese terms, and we do a lot around new product innovation, Ms Crowther said.  Meanwhile, attending to the beauty needs of the domestic South Asian community, which ELC highlighted as the largest minority group in the UK, growing at 33% per year, could mean addressing concerns about dark under eye circles and pigmentation and extending it shade ranges for foundations and concealers.  Considerations have also been made for the Black British customer, \u0026nbspwhich is growing 40 times that of the Caucasian British consumer base, through products like its beauty boxes, with ELC enlisting the help of Vogue\u0026rsquos contributing beauty editor Funmi Fetto.  \u0026ldquoFunmi handpicked a number of different products across our business that she knew would resonate anything from a curl enhancer, because obviously taming curls is a big concern for this consumer, as well as under eye brightness and a moisturiser all about balancing skin, Ms Crowther said.  There is also interest in catering to the tourist population, including Chinese, Indian and South East Asian communities, while ELC keeps an eye on the return of Russian, Brazilian and Nigerian tourists to the UK.  ELC prepares for inbound tourists with monthly flight reports, that helps staff understand \u0026ldquowho is coming from where and at what time.  \u0026ldquoIt ensures that whenever anybody is coming to our counters that we are appropriately able to service them and understand a lot more about what they\u0026rsquore looking for."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8162320.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"facebook-starts-testing-dating-service-internally","story":"  The social network, which announced plans to enter the dating business during its F8 conference in May, regularly tests new features internally ahead of launch to iron out any bugs.

The Herald revealed yesterday that the SUAT, which is being investigated by the Electoral Commission over its status as a political donor, helped bankroll a campaign manager for Mr Mundell at the last two general elections.  Mr Mundell reported his campaign manager costs as \u0026pound3488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2400 in 2017.  The Tories said Mr Mundell didn\u0026rsquot need to register the money at the Commons as the SUAT gave it to his local party, not to him, to fund a campaign manager.  However the Commons Code of Conduct says MPs must register donations over \u0026pound1500 given to a local party and there is \u0026ldquoa clear link between the donation and [the MP] for example, if it was given... with a wish that it be allocated... to his or her fighting fund.  Mr Mundell, the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale, has never declared any financial support from the SUAT in his register of interests.  Nor did he refer to the SUAT\u0026rsquos financial support in his office candidate return in 2015.  The salary for Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager in 2017 was split 50-50 by the SUAT and Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association.  The cost in 2015 was split between the SUAT and Tory HQ in London, although the Borders Association accounts do not say if this was also a 50-50 split.  However invoices from Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign refer to 141 days \u0026ldquo@ 50%, suggesting it was an equal split.  If half the bill in 2015 was indeed met by the SUAT, this would be \u0026pound1744, above the \u0026pound1500 threshold for declarations in the register of interests.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001, does not publish accounts or detail the source of its income, leading to SNP claims it is a source of so-called \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo, or untraceable political funding.  It was only after SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked Theresa May about the SUAT in the Commons last month that it finally published a list of its trustees.  The SUAT chair is Robert Miller-Bakewell, who was Borders Association chair and treasurer in 2014 and 2015, when the SUAT began funding Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe dark money scandal goes from bad to worse.  \u0026ldquoThere are questions over whether David Mundell failed to properly declare the benefit he received. Was he trying to hide something? In the interests of complete transparency it\u0026rsquos high time Mr Mundell was open and honest about the source of these funds.  \u0026ldquoThe Secretary of State should refer himself to the Commissioner for Standards to investigate whether he breached strict parliamentary rules over declaring political donations.  Mr Miller-Bakewell did not respond to requests for comment.  A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \u0026ldquoThere is no requirement to place this funding on the MPs Register of Interests. This funding was not given to Mr Mundell or to his fighting fund. It was given to the local association to help fund regional campaign managers over recent years.  \"In compliance with the rules, it was therefore registered as a donation with the Electoral Commission. \"Mr Mundell properly declared the value of the campaign manager in his election returns in 2015 and 2017.  \"As an MP of 13 years standing, Mr Mundell has a track record of complete transparency and every donation he has received in compliance with both the spirit and letter of the rules.\"?"},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-calls-for-further-labour-discussion-with-jewish-community","story":"  Mr Leonard said the party needed to win the confidence of Jewish supporters, however he stopped short of backing the adoption of the international definition of anti-Semitism in full.

Pressed on his views during an interview with BBC Radio Scotland\u0027s Good Morning Scotland, Mr Leonard said: \"I am willing to recommend we have further discussion and dialogue with the Jewish community, including the Jewish community in Scotland, which I intend to lead on, because we need to win the confidence of the Jewish community.  \"We need to get to a position where not only have we got a very robust code on anti-Semitism within the Labour Party - which we are striving to achieve - but also which allows for freedom of speech, a discourse around Palestine and Israel.\"  He added: \"I want to make sure that the Labour Party is not only a party that the Jewish community supports, but is prepared to join and be active in.\"  \"There has got to be a way through this, and the way through this may be that we do, in the end, adopt in full all of the working examples in the IHRA code, but I am also determined to make sure that freedom of speech is maintained inside the Labour Party too.\"  Mr Leonard\u0027s comments come as Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s efforts to build bridges with the Jewish community were rebuffed by critics.  The Labour leader has insisted he will root out anti-Semites from Labour and acknowledged mistakes in the way the party had handled the crisis.  But the Jewish Labour Movement said trust had broken down with the party leadership, while the Campaign Against Antisemitism lashed out at Mr Corbyn\u0027s failure to apologise for his own conduct.  Tory MP Paul Masterton said: \"Richard Leonard appears as lacklustre as Jeremy Corbyn when it comes to tackling anti-Semitism in Labour.  \"Many within his own party will find it hard to understand why he was unable to endorse the IHRA code under questioning this morning.  \"With former Glasgow MP Tom Harris resigning from the party this weekend after 34 years, Labour is once again in chaos.\"  Mr Harris has been a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn and told The Herald newspaper on his resignation from Labour: \"It\u0027s just not the place for me any more\".

She told host Graham Spiers that while she enjoyed helping her constituents, she did not enjoy the other side of the job \"and the crap that comes with it\".  \"I think Westminster itself as an institution is founded upon all the bits of being an MP I don\u0027t like,\" she said.  \"It does not serve us, and in actual fact I would go so far as to say it\u0027s not even a parliament - it is a club that masquerades itself.  \"It is designed in such a way that people are not held to account, it is designed in such a way that you can bleat and complain and vote against things, and it doesn\u0027t make a blind bit of difference.  \"It is designed in such a way that you will fall at every hurdle.  \"It is as difficult as it possibly can be to get any change.\"  She continued: \"As an institution it is defunct, it is not fit for purpose.\"  Alongside her views on Westminster, Ms Black also voiced criticism of her fellow MPs, whom she once described in an interview as \"sociopaths\".  \"Politics attracts quite often the worst of humanity,\" she said.  \"It attracts people who are power hungry, who have all kinds of hidden agendas.  \"So, if you\u0027ve got all of them in this institution that the public doesn\u0027t understand, that the public assumes is too complicated for them, and they can legitimately get away with wasting hundreds of pounds under the guise of protocol and tradition, then of course they\u0027re going to do that.\"  Asked about rumours she could quit Westminster, Ms Black, who was just 20 when she became the youngest MP three years ago, said she did not know whether she would stand for re-election.

Judge Frances Eccles ruled that sovereignty and \u0026ldquoself-determination are \u0026ldquoweighty and substantial aspects of human life and the merits of McEleny\u0026rsquos case can now go forward to a full hearing.  The MoD had argued that independence is not a philosophical belief because it has little impact on people in Tanzania and Peru, an argument the judge rejected.  In 2016 McEleny, who is the SNP group leader on Inverclyde Council, announced his candidacy to become his party\u0026rsquos depute leader.  He was also an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith and, around the time of the leadership hustings, was told by his employer that his security clearance had been revoked and he was suspended.  National security officials interviewed him at his home and he was quizzed about his mental health, social media references to Rangers, Trident, and a pro-independence speech he made at an SNP conference.  McEleny quit after believing he had been targeted over his independence stance and pursued a discrimination claim against the MoD.  However, before the case could proceed, McEleny had to convince the judge that his independence convictions or the \u0026ldquosocial democratic values of the SNP amounted to a \u0026ldquophilosophical belief under the 2010 Equality Act and were thus a \u0026ldquoprotected characteristic.    Picture: McEleny  A key part of McEleny\u0026rsquos argument rested on a previous case \u0026ndash Grainger plc v Nicholson \u0026ndash which focused on a staff member who believed he was made redundant over his belief in climate change. In Grainger, the judge backed the claimant and ruled that his strong beliefs were protected under the law.  This previous decision stated that a philosophical belief had to be \u0026ldquogenuinely held, not be an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available, and should relate to \u0026ldquoweighty and substantial aspects of human life and behaviour.  The belief must also attain a \u0026ldquocertain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance, and also be \u0026ldquoworthy of respect in a democratic society.  According to the judge\u0026rsquos summary of the evidence in the McEleny case, the councillor argued that the Grainger tests led to the \u0026ldquoinevitable conclusion that a belief in independence should be protected from discrimination.  McEleny, who was aided by written representations from former First Minister Alex Salmond, argued that his belief independence was \u0026ldquogenuinely held and was \u0026ldquoserious, cohesive and important.  He argued that the 2014 referendum, as well as the SNP\u0026rsquos participation in elections, were evidence of his belief being \u0026ldquoworthy of respect in a democratic society.  The summary noted: \u0026ldquoThe claimant submitted that he was not claiming to believe that Scottish independence could improve the lives and economy of Scottish people. His belief that decisions regarding Scotland should be made by the people of Scotland regardless of the outcome will never change.  McEleny, who represented himself, was quoted saying his belief in independence had affected his \u0026ldquoentire life, the choices and actions and decisions he takes.  In response, the MoD accepted that support for independence and the SNP\u0026rsquos values were \u0026ldquoworthy of respect, but claimed there was a big difference between political opinion or affiliation, and a philosophical belief:  \u0026ldquoSupport for Scottish independence and the social democratic values of the SNP ... is a political opinion. It does not have a similar status or cogency to a religious belief, the summary stated.  It added: \u0026ldquoWhether Scottish people would be better off voting for independence and the SNP ... is like any viewpoint, very much open for debate.  \u0026ldquoIt is an opinion with which many agree and many disagree. It will very much depend upon the present state of information available.  The judge\u0026rsquos summary of the UK Government\u0026rsquos position noted: \u0026ldquoIt [independence] does not impact on people in a general sense and provide a moral and ethical code by which people choose to live their lives.  \u0026ldquoRegardless of its importance to the electorate of Scotland ... Scottish independence and the SNP have no substantial impact on the lives of citizens in for example Tanzania, Peru or India.  The MoD also claimed that independence and the values of the SNP are not political opinions worthy of respect in any democratic society outwith the UK.  The summary stated: \u0026ldquoHe [the MoD solicitor] described them as a constitutional matter of concern to the UK but that is as far as they go.  The UK Government department also argued that support for independence is not on a par with a belief in democratic socialism, free market capitalism, Marxism or \u0026ldquosimilar political philosophy.  Eccles\u0027 summary of the MoD evidence concluded: \u0026ldquoA belief in Scottish independence does not impact upon the whole of mankind in terms of how we lead our lives or at least should lead our lives according to those who hold the belief.  \u0026ldquoIt lacks the moral or ethical conviction required to amount to a philosophical belief which is why ... the claim must fail.  In her ruling, the judge agreed with the MoD that support or active membership of a political party does not in itself amount to a philosophical belief, and argued that McEleny\u0026rsquos backing for the SNP\u0026rsquos social democratic values does not meet the requirements:  \u0026ldquoIf the SNP was to abandon its commitment to Scottish independence, something which I accept is unlikely, I am in no doubt that it could no longer be guaranteed the claimant\u0026rsquos support.  However, she wrote that McEleny\u0026rsquos belief in independence is not simply an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available.  \u0026ldquoHe does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland. It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.  The judge continued: \u0026ldquoI also do not accept that because Scottish independence might not impact on someone living in Tanzania ... or that Scottish independence is not of concern to a Tanzanian prevents the claimant\u0026rsquos belief from being philosophical in nature.  \u0026ldquoI am in no doubt that throughout a significant part of the last century national sovereignty and independence from British rule were weighty and substantial aspects of life in Tanzania, or Tanganyika as it then was.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe claimant has persuaded me that his belief in Scottish independence has a sufficiently similar cogency to a religious belief as required by Justice Burton in Grainger to qualify as a philosophical belief.    Picture: Aamer Anwar  The ruling means McEleny\u0026rsquos belief in independence can now be relied on as a \u0026ldquoprotected characteristic. A full hearing will take place in the case.  Lawyer Aamer Anwar, speaking on behalf of McEleny, said:  \u0026ldquoCouncillor McEleny welcomes this decision which makes legal history as it establishes in principle, a belief in Scottish Independence is capable of being a \u0026ldquophilosophical belief and therefore a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.  \"This legal precedent now enables my client to pursue a claim for direct discrimination alleging that he was discriminated against because of this belief.  \"To date the MoD tried to maintain that his belief in Scottish independence could not be protected from discrimination yet they have lost their core argument in court.  \"It is completely unacceptable that the UK Government and Whitehall officials had Cllr McEleny suspended as he alleges because of his political affiliation and his belief in Scottish.\" independence.\"  An MoD spokesperson said: \"It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of an ongoing employment tribunal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"further-faster-higher-younger-edinburghs-festivals-of-extremes","story":"  Most head spins  Aichi Ono, from Kyoto in Japan, claims to have the world record for the highest number of head spins in one minute, at 142, and, indeed, you can see him doing them in an online video.

You can watch this marvel in the cabaret show, Little Death Club.  \u0026ldquoI started doing flaming nipple tassels for a burlesque show in the West End called Hurly Burly, she recalls. \u0026ldquoI was doing my fire act in the show and the director, William Baker, decided that he wanted me to do flaming nipple tassels so I did some research, bought a pair and took it from there. There aren\u0026rsquot many performers who do fire tassels because frankly, it kind of burns!  Longest Fringe gig  There are endurance athletes, and then there are endurance comedians. Mark Watson is the latter, capable of standing on a stage telling jokes virtually till he drops. Many comedians can barely manage an hour, but he just keeps on going. When, in 2006, he did a 36-hour gag stint, he didn\u0026rsquot register it in the Guinness Book of World Records, but it\u0026rsquos widely considered the longest Fringe gig ever.  Three years ago when he did a 27-hour show, he observed that such mega-shows had become, for him, \"a bit of an addiction\". \u0026ldquoYou can do so much with an audience in 27 hours. It does feel a bit tame going back to normal stand-up afterwards. This year\u0026rsquos show, the Infinite, which comes in at just an hour long, seems positively finite.  Most portraits sketched in 12 hours  In 2016, sitting on the Royal Mile, by the Adam Smith statue, American artist and fringe performer Walter Deforest churned out 160 portraits, breaking the former Guinness World Record set by David Gilhooley in 2014. Last year, he was back, with his show Van Gogh Find Yourself, and breaking it again with 163. Will he smash his sketch record again this year?  Most political demonstrations attended in one day  Back in 2006, activist and comedian Mark Thomas set the world record for most demonstrations attended in one day, squeezing in 20, including one to stop MPs having more than one job and another to sack private tube contractors. Four years later the record was broken by sixth formers from Freman College, Buntingford, when they held 23 consecutive protests across central London, all highlighting a different human rights issue.  Thomas\u0026rsquos show this year \u0026ndash Check Up: Our NHS At 70 \u0026ndash could make you want to get out and set your own protest record.  Longest paper doll chain  Though Julia Donaldson didn\u0026rsquot herself craft the paper dolls that were strung together in 2013 to make the longest paper doll chain of 4.5 km, she did, with her fantastical book, The Paper Dolls, inspire thousands of children across the world to make them.  The dearly loved children\u0026rsquos author brings a new show to the Fringe this year, featuring some of her most popular characters and titled The Gruffalo, The Witch And The Warthog.  Most pierced  Officially the most pierced woman in the world, according to Guinness, Elaine Davidson is not only a Fringe regular, but Edinburgh resident and icon. Her Kinky Freakshow introduces the audience to her astounding and ever-increasing collection of piercings.  Back in 2000 when she first set the record she had a mere 462, but by 2017 she was boasting 10,503, including many that are internal.  Sword swallowing  Miss Behave, who brings her Miss Behave Gameshow to the Fringe this year, set the world record for female sword swallowing in 2004, when she swallowed seven swords \u0026ndash it has since been broken by Natasha Varushka with 13. Even that, however, seems unambitious compared with the feats of the legendary Edith Clifford, the world\u0026rsquos most famous female sword swallower, who in the 1800s is said to have swallowed 18.  \u0026ldquoMy goal, Saunders has said, \u0026ldquoand it\u0026rsquos kind of fallen by the wayside, is to break Edith Clifford\u0026rsquos record if possible. I just need a very good props maker. For the Miss Behave Gameshow, however it\u0026rsquos less about the artiste stretching herself, than challenging the audience."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8161742.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scot-linked-to-brexit-dark-money-donation-faces-call-to-give-evidence-to-westminster-committee","story":"  SNP MP Brendan O\u0026rsquoHara said it was \u0026ldquoimperative that Richard Cook, chair of the secretive Constitutional Research Council, answered questions in front of MPs about the CRC\u0026rsquos infamous donation.  He believes Cook should be quizzed by members of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee, which has focused on the leave campaign as part of a wider probe.  It emerged last year that the CRC had ploughed in around \u0026pound435,000 to the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign.  However, although the cash was given to a party in Ulster, much of the donation was spent on the mainland in the form of a wraparound advert in the  newspaper, which is not sold in Northern Ireland.  Despite the size of the donation, the DUP was under no obligation to name the CRC as the source \u0026ndash declaration laws did not apply then to Northern Ireland \u0026ndash and did so voluntarily.  CATCH UP: What happened when the Sunday Herald spoke to Cook  The only detail to come out about the CRC is that Cook, who failed on several occasions to get elected for the Scottish Tories, chairs the body.  He confirmed the CRC has an executive committee, but has declined to name its members, put a figure on how much it has raised, or talk about other specific causes that have been funded.  Cook, who owns a modest house in East Renfrewshire, has also consistently refused to say who gave the CRC the \u0026pound435,000. He is under no legal obligation to provide the donor names, prompting critics to describe it as an example of \u0026ldquodark money.    Image: Cook (left) during the 2010 general election campaign  The DCMS last year launched an inquiry into the growth of so-called \u0026ldquofake news and the impact it has on the \u0026ldquopublic understanding of the world and on traditional journalism.  The committee, which issued an interim report recently, focused heavily on some of the tactics used by pro-Brexit groups during the referendum.  MPs have been praised for the work carried out as part of the probe, but have been hampered by the refusal of senior Vote Leave figure Dominic Cummings to attend.  Given the CRC\u0026rsquos prominent role in the referendum, O\u0026rsquoHara has written to the committee\u0027s chair, Tory MP Damian Collins, and called for Cook to give evidence.  He told this newspaper: \"I have called on the DCMS Committee to summon Mr Richard Cook to give evidence to our on-going inquiry into the vote leave campaign. It is imperative that we have a full understanding of his role, how the CRC processed \u0026pound435,000 to the DUP and whether he booked the infamous  advertisement for Vote Leave.\"  He added: \"It\u0027s time we had some answers \u0026ndash Richard Cook should help the DCMS Committee with their investigations and provide some much needed clarity.\"  Speaking to the Sunday Herald last year, Cook said of the body he chairs: \u0026ldquoThe CRC is regulated by the Electoral Commission. We operate solely in the UK. We accept donations only from eligible UK donors. We donate solely to permissible UK entities. Any suggestion that we have done anything else is basically defamatory.  Explaining the CRC\u0026rsquos internal decision-making process, he said: \u0026ldquoThe process is quite simple: people come to us with projects [and] they tell us how it is promoting the Union. The Executive Committee assess that and will decide. I don\u0026rsquot decide on my own. I\u0026rsquom just part of the process.  On who had contributed financially to the CRC, he said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to get into the donors, like I am not going to get into the members.  Asked if any Scots had donated to the CRC, he replied: \u0026ldquoYes.  Cook has made several\u0026nbspattempts at getting elected for the Scottish Tories, such as when he polled 13.4% in\u0026nbspGlasgow\u0026nbspCathcart in 2001. He came third again the same seat four years later in a\u0026nbspHolyrood\u0026nbspby-election.  In 2010, he tried to\u0026nbspdislodge\u0026nbspLabour\u0026rsquos Jim Murphy in East Renfrewshire, but lost by around 10,000 votes.  Cook did not provide a comment for the story."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-mhairi-black-uk-government-could-potentially-shut-down-holyrood","story":"  MP Mhairi Black made the comment after being asked about what the UK Government would do in the event of a national emergency.  In a wide-ranging interview at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, she also spoke about Catholic schools and her scepticism about holding another referendum on the European Union.  Black, who represents Paisley and Renfrewshire South for the Nationalists, was elected at the age of 20 and is widely seen as a future leader of the party.  During an \u0026ldquoin conversation event yesterday chaired by journalist Graham Speirs, she told the audience that Westminster could ultimately legislate on any matter in Scotland, despite devolution: \u0026ldquoThe UK Parliament can do what they like with us, legally, can do what they like. The only thing that is left stopping them is the political will.  Asked if the Government would shut down the devolved parliaments if they called a state of national emergency, she replied: \u0026ldquoPotentially.  On the prospect of a second Brexit vote, she said: \u0026ldquoMy genuine answer is \u0026lsquowhat\u0026rsquos the point?\u0026rsquo She argued that Scotland had already voted to remain and had been \u0026ldquoignored, which is why she wanted to talk about independence.  Black also said that none of the political parties, including the SNP, had a good campaign during the Brexit referendum because there was \u0026ldquono natural desire for the referendum and the debate was fought on the \u0026ldquoturf of the political Right.  The MP also said a \u0026ldquolot\" of people, even in the SNP, have concerns about the European Union and its institutions, but claimed there was \u0026ldquono room to have a \u0026ldquomature debate on the subject.  Asked whether she, and the SNP, believed it was good for the future of Scotland to have children educated along religious lines, Black, who attended a Catholic school, offered a \u0026ldquopersonal view.  She said: \u0026ldquoJust when I am thinking of some of the damage that was done to me, in an LGBT sense, growing up, is something that I wouldn\u0026rsquot want any other child to ever have to suffer ever again.  Black said a debate \u0026ldquohas to happen but added she did not know what the answer would be.  Meanwhile, the Glasgow University graduate also addressed questions on her unlikely rapport with Tory MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.  \"In a colleague sense, I get on fine with the guy, but his views are vile,\" Black said.  \"People need to acknowledge this guy is dangerous, because for all the manners and all the niceness, he doesn\u0027t think women should have the right to their body, he doesn\u0027t think I should be allowed to get married because I\u0027m gay.  \"That\u0027s terrifying.\""},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-dont-let-the-blind-men-of-brexit-take-us-over-the-cliff","story":"  In this summer of discontent, as Britain digs in for a Dad\u0026rsquos Army departure from the EU, complete with stockpiling food and martial law at the ports, it\u0026rsquos clear none of the options before parliament can prevail.

It\u0026rsquos different from No Deal in that it does involve a partial deal, that Britain will pay the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill, recognise the rights of EU citizens and accept an Irish backstop.  There would also be a solemn and binding commitment to working for a \u0026ldquofriction-free trade agreement, which no-one would believe, but would park the issue until after Britain is clearly and finally out of the European Union.  Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is thought to be open to this and willing to add agreements on security co-operation to any such deal in October. The Germans have denied that they favour Blind Brexit, but there does appear to be a softening of attitudes on the continent \u0026ndash or perhaps they\u0026rsquore just getting bored with the whole Brexit business.  Clearly, Theresa May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement is a non-starter. The EU can\u0026rsquot allow a country that isn\u0026rsquot a member of the customs union to collect duties. Britain could have a Canada-style free trade deal, a Norway-style EEA arrangement, which means remaining in the single market, or World Trade Rules, which (when negotiated) would mean tariffs and non-tariff barriers on goods going to the EU. Or none of the above, if you want to go the full Mogg.  May\u0026rsquos plan could, in theory, be adapted to become the European Economic Area \u0026ndash perhaps by having Britain rejoin the European Free Trade Area. EFTA was created by Britain in 1960, has its own court for settling disputes and would allow Britain to discretely join the EEA. In many ways, EFTA is the obvious solution, as even Tory Brexiteers like Daniel Hannan MEP argue. But this \u0026ldquoNorway plus model would never get past the Brexit headbangers of the Tory European Research Group of MPs. Moreover, the EEA is rejected by Jeremy Corbyn for reasons that defy explanation.  For their part, Brussels doesn\u0026rsquot want a crash-out/no-deal Brexit because it might lose the \u0026pound40 billion that Britain owes to the EU budget. A Blind Brexit in October would at least secure the EU\u0026rsquos money and the future of EU citizens. Parking Britain\u0026rsquos future trade relationship could also work rather well for the 27. Businesses like Airbus are talking about moving production to the EU. Some financial organisations already have done so, including two of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026rsquos investment funds, confirming that money has no shame.  But Blind Brexit would be a catastrophe for Britain. At least with No Deal there is the option of  delaying the implementation of Article 50 at the last minute. The Brussels rules allow this \u0026ndash indeed, Britain could delay its departure indefinitely. As the former EU ambassador, John Kerr, has pointed out, freezing Article 50 would allow Britain to keep its current favourable deal with the EU.  If Article 50 just doesn\u0026rsquot happen, nothing does. We remain in the European Single Market and the Customs Union and there is no border issue in Ireland. More importantly, Britain doesn\u0026rsquot lose its hard-won opt-outs from EU Treaties, such as from the single currency, or its rebates from EU budget contributions. And, unlike the EEA option, Britain retains its say in the formation of single market policies. Moreover, the \u0026ldquopower grab of devolved responsibilities, that is threatening to undermine the Scottish Parliament, would also be halted. The EU Withdrawal Bill, which has sought to repeal the 1998 Scotland Act, would be stillborn.  THE truth is that Britain already has a very good deal from the European Union negotiated over many years. It is obvious now that there\u0026rsquos no way of replicating that favourable trading status from outside the EU. The Brexiteers have failed to come up with any credible plan that doesn\u0026rsquot involve huge losses for British industry and taxpayers. Theresa May\u0026rsquos White Paper compromise keeps all the \u0026ldquobad things about being in Europe \u0026ndash the European Court, payments to Brussels, rules and regulations \u0026ndash without Britain having any say in them.  It\u0026rsquos also becoming clear that there will be the mother of all recessions when Britain leaves the EU. This is because of shrinking trade, collapsing investment, food-price inflation and the departure of migrant workers. That\u0026rsquos why the Bank of England jacked up interest rates last week. Governor Mark Carney revealed that the bank has \u0026ldquostress tested for unemployment doubling, house prices collapsing by 30 per cent, and interest rates tripling. He also pointed out that Britain has already lost two per cent of GDP because of Brexit.  This is why the Michael Goves are giving the nod to Brussels that, if they just hold off decisions on our future trading arrangements, the UK will pay them the divorce money.  His Brexit supporters realise that the roof is about to fall in, but they hope that if they can just scrape over the March 29 deadline, then it won\u0026rsquot matter because Britain will be out of the EU with no prospect of getting back in. Why? Because it is inconceivable in future when (and it surely will be when) Britain tries to get back into the single market, that the EU will ever offer us a deal comparable to what we\u0026rsquove just lost by leaving.  Blind Brexit is a real possibility, if only because Labour is reluctant to prevent it. Jeremy Corbyn is no great EU enthusiast anyway, and he probably hopes that, once the post-Brexit recession hits, the backlash will propel Labour into office. It very well might. But Labour would be inheriting an economy in a death spiral, with no prospect of rectifying matters in the short term.  The Hard Brexiteers have already factored a Tory defeat into their calculations. They know that May is doomed, and that this Conservative Government will fall sooner rather than later. But they believe a short, sharp spell of Corbynomics, against a background of chaotic post-Brexit economic recession, will allow the Tories to come roaring back in five years \u0026ndash or maybe 10 \u0026ndash with a hard right-wing leadership under Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson.  This must not be allowed to happen. Britain must wake up from its Dad\u0026rsquos Army nostalgia. Labour, SNP, LibDems and Tory Remainers must get together and ensure that there\u0026rsquos no Article 50 until there\u0026rsquos a trade deal.

The Sunday Herald has learned that one of Gougeon\u0026rsquos first tasks will be to decide whether to overhaul the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act following a review by former judge Lord Bonomy which recommended strengthening the legislation.  Cabinet secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, Roseanna Cunningham, had responsibility before Gougeon took it on.  The junior minister met stakeholders this week, including the Scottish Countryside Alliance, which is pro-hunting, and animal welfare charities the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the League Against Cruel Sports Scotland.  Gougeon, who was first elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2016, is understood to be considering how to respond to a public consultation which showed overwhelming support for reform.  Almost all of the 18,787 respondents indicated support for moves which would strengthen the 2002 law. The Bonomy review concluded that there are still \u0026ldquoaspects and features of the legislation which complicate unduly the detection, investigation and prosecution of alleged offences.  The Scottish Government analysis of the public consultation said: \u0026ldquoBetween 94 per cent and 98 per cent of respondents indicated support for or agreement with each of Lord Bonomy\u0026rsquos proposals for reform.  \u0026ldquoThese figures reflect the very large campaign response. Among the organisational respondents, animal welfare charities and campaign groups indicated support, whereas countryside management and sporting groups generally indicated opposition.  The 2002 act banned hunts from using dogs to track down and tear apart foxes. The existing legislation still allows huntsmen to use dogs to flush animals from cover before they are shot.  The Scottish Countryside Alliance has always insisted all hunts have operated within the law since the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act was passed, but animal welfare charities have gathered evidence which appears to contradict this position. The new season begins on November 1.  Robbie Marsland, director of the League Against Cruel Sports Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWith this year\u0027s hunting season getting closer, it\u0027s disappointing that we are still in the same position as previous years with a law which is highly ineffective in doing what it was intended for.  \u0026ldquoHowever, we are pleased to have a new minister tasked with progressing Bonomy\u0027s recommendations and we are keen to work productively with her to ensure that fox hunting is really banned in Scotland \u0026ndash for good.  Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone added: \u0026ldquoNew minister Mairi Gougeon can hit the ground running and show real commitment to animal welfare in Scotland by making this legislation fit for purpose, properly banning fox hunting for once and for all.  \u0026ldquoI will do all that I can to support her in ending this barbaric sport. Polling shows she will have the support too of the overwhelming majority of people in this country.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to ensuring the highest welfare standards for all animals \u0026ndash including those in the wild.  \u0026ldquoAlmost 20,000 people responded to our consultation on Lord Bonomy\u0026rsquos recommendations and we have now published the consultation analysis which the newly appointed Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Mairi Gougeon will consider before setting out next steps as part of her remit which includes animal welfare.  The Scottish Countryside Alliance did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"a-hollow-victory-the-aftermath-of-the-zimbabwe-elections","story":"  Ten years ago in the wake of a presidential election in Zimbabwe, I found myself standing in a rundown cemetery on the outskirts of the capital Harare.  I had come to find the graves of people who had died from a recent cholera outbreak that then president Robert Mugabe insisted had never happened.  According to Mugabe there was \u0026ldquono cholera in Zimbabwe even though that same day I spoke with many relatives of those who had died.  Among those that I met was Cecilia, a 70-year old woman who had come for the first time to visit the grave of her 18-year old granddaughter who had died slowly and painfully from the disease.  Cecilia\u0026rsquos family were poor, the sort who suffers most in a country with a crumbling healthcare system, economic collapse, hunger and political oppression. In Zimbabwe at that time under the iron grip of Mugabe\u0026rsquos regime, there was no shortage of painful and often violent ways to die.  Fast forward 10 years and I\u0026rsquom back in Zimbabwe, this time just before the latest presidential elections that have played out so dramatically over the past week. Once again I found myself in an impoverished township, a place called Mbare one of the biggest and oldest in Harare.  Here too poverty is rife, the uncollected refuse, overcrowding, rampant petty crime and widespread health and sanitation problems, all legacies of those years during which the Mugabe regime let Mbare and much of Zimbabwe rot.  But the mood among those Zimbabweans I met this time round has changed. Four months after Mugabe\u0026rsquos 40-year long rule was broken when he was ousted in a coup, people are looking forward to what they believe will be the country\u0026rsquos first free and fair election in decades.  That long-awaited and eagerly anticipated poll was finally run last week, but its outcome has done little to heal the wounds in a country still deeply divided and living in the shadow of its authoritarian past.  After days of bitter claims and counter-claims, incumbent president Emmerson Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old former spy chief, nicknamed \u0026lsquothe crocodile,\u0026rsquo secured a comfortable victory for his Zanu-PF party, polling 50.8 per cent of the votes.  His main rival 40-year-old opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance gained 44.3 per cent of the ballot. Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos majority thus avoided a run-off.  Overall Zanu-PF kept its parliamentary majority with 144 of 210 seats while the MDC won 64.  Voter turnout overall was high at more than 75 per cent, reflecting the hope of Zimbabweans that the election would be fair. Many of those monitoring the ballot, however, believe it wasn\u0026rsquot.  European Union observers cited \u0026ldquomisuse of state resources, instances of coercion and intimidation, partisan behaviour by traditional leaders and overt bias in state media, all to the Zanu-PF\u0026rsquos advantage. Security forces meanwhile raided opposition headquarters and broke up a press conference at a Harare hotel on Friday.  The same day Mnangagwa did his best to sound a conciliatory note after six people were killed in a post-election crackdown by the military. He vowed to be president for all Zimbabweans and declared his rival Chamisa would have a vital role to perform in Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoTo Nelson Chamisa, I want to say: you have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos present and its unfolding future. Let us both call for peace and unity in our land, Mnangagwa appealed.  But Chamisa in his first public appearance since Mnangagwa was declared election winner early on Friday morning, told reporters Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos ruling Zanu-PF had authorised the army crackdown on opposition supporters because it knew it had lost the election.  \u0026ldquoMr Mnangagwa did not win the election in this country \u0026hellip we won this election emphatically, Chamisa said. \u0026ldquoIf you go around the country you will find no celebration. This is a black day for democracy. We are seeing a repeat of the last regime.  Chamisa went on to insist that he and his supporters would \u0026ldquoexplore all necessary means, legal and constitutional, to ensure that the will of the people is protected.  Zimbabwe\u0027s constitution does allow for a legal challenge to the results, but Chamisa now has the huge task of proving in court with hard evidence what until now have only been claims and accusations.  In Harare, however, many MDC supporters appeared resigned to the result and unwilling to take to the streets to protest, perhaps fearing another crackdown by the police and army.  Meanwhilethe continuing war of words between the two leaders bodes ill for Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos future political direction, one being watched carefully by its African neighbours and the wider international community.  Hoping to attract renewed investment from the West, Mnangagwa worked during the election campaign to moderate his image with a message that Zimbabwe was embracing democracy and human rights.  Some critics though have seen his election as little more than an extension of Mugabe\u0026rsquos long rule. Mnangagwa, they point out was Mugabe\u0026rsquos right-hand man and behind some of his most repressive policies.  Already the heavy-handed response towards protesters has raised questions over who could have ordered the army on to the streets last week and who is really running the government.  Some election observers say that the army\u0026rsquos deployment and the repression used has shot a hole in the government\u0026rsquos claims that Zimbabwe has thrown off its authoritarian past. Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos government is nothing more than a military junta in disguise some claim. They point to Constantino Chiwenga, the military leader of last November\u0026rsquos coup that ended Mugabe\u0026rsquos rule as the man who is really in charge.  \u0026ldquoThe government still has a military core and a military ethos, was how Zimbabwe expert Stephen Chan, of London University\u0026rsquos School of Oriental and African Studies, summed up the situation.  \u0026ldquoHow can you be so goddam clumsy? You\u0026rsquove gone to all this trouble to stage manage this stuff and you\u0026rsquove just gone and shot yourself in the foot, Chan wryly observed about Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos handling of the election and subsequent protests in Harare last week. Mnangagwa\u0026rsquos spat with Chamisa aside, his victory could prove hollow in other ways too.  As the country\u0026rsquos leader he will have to administer an economy in meltdown after two decades of misrule and corruption under Mugabe and a near bankrupt Treasury that\u0026rsquos unable to service its loans or take out new ones. All this will leave Mnangagwa little scope to improve government services, rebuild crumbling transport links and meet a plethora of other election pledges.  The challenges the president faces are all too obvious to any visitor to the country. Some districts in the capital Harare, a sprawling, run-down city of about 4 million people haven\u0026rsquot had running water for years. Raw sewage leaks from burst pipes that go unfixed for weeks at a time and long stretches of tarmac roads have been reduced to rutted tracks. Harare city council estimates it needs $10 billion to repair infrastructure and attend to its maintenance backlog.  Time and again while in Zimbabwe in the run up to the elections, I listened to government officials repeat the political mantra that Zimbabwe was now \u0026ldquoopen for business.  The bad old days of authoritarian rule they insisted were now behind the country.  But on Friday on Harare\u0026rsquos streets it was police officers in vehicles with mounted loudspeakers that toured the city\u0026rsquos streets reassuring shopkeepers.  \u0026ldquoZimbabwe is open for business. We are here to protect you. Feel free to walk and open your business. All is well, fear not, the officers insisted.  It was all a far cry from the positive tone of the government\u0026rsquos message in the run up to the election.  \u0026ldquoThis has blown the slogan \u0026lsquoOpen for Business\u0026rsquo into smoke, Ibbo Mandaza, a political analyst and a former member of the ruling Zanu-PF, told the Financial Times last week.  \u0026ldquoThe consensus now is that engagement with the west is a very far-off prospect, he said, citing discussions with foreign observers and diplomats shocked at the violent turn the elections had taken.  Mnangagwa faces no end of other problems too, not least the country\u0026rsquos currency crisis. Some time ago the government introduced bond notes, a dollar-backed quasi-currency, to ease Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos liquidity crisis, but the effect has been marginal.  Today more than 98 per cent of transactions are conducted via bank and other transfers and dollar bills are worth as much as 80 per cent more that their electronic equivalent.  But the financial problems go even deeper. According to research by Bloomberg business news, the government currently has about 350,000 employees whose wages gobble up almost the entire national budget. It also owns about 100 companies, most of which are cash-strapped and dysfunctional.  Zimbabwe is also saddled with $1.7 billion of arrears owed to the African Development Bank and World Bank that it needs to clear before it can tap new loans from multilateral lenders.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard lots of talk about being open for business, but nothing tangible to attract business, John Robertson, an independent economist based in Harare told Bloomberg. \u0026ldquoAs things stand, it\u0026rsquos cheaper to import products than manufacture them locally because of the very high production costs.  All of this is being carefully noted and monitored by current and potential future investors in Zimbabwe.  Earlier this year in Harare, the European Union\u0026rsquos Commissioner for International Development, Neven Mimica, signed an agreement with Zimbabwean officials that saw new EU-funded programmes worth \u0026pound20 million launched to improve people\u0026rsquos access to health services and enhance their livelihoods.  I asked Mr Mimica at the time whether such future funding might be reconsidered should Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos election fail to be free and transparent and any future administration not live up to the democratic terms laid down as conditions.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has always been a reliable partner of the Zimbabwean people, and it stands ready to accompany Zimbabwe in its process of change, said Mr Mimica  \u0026ldquoWe do not want to be a passive partner in this process, he added, stressing that the EU and others were watching Zimbabwe\u0026rsquos impending elections carefully and that reforms must be made and checks carried out that such a process is under way for EU financial support to be maintained.  Given events surrounding the election last week Mimica\u0026rsquos words have taken on a fresh and imperative resonance. Whether Zimbabwe is on a genuinely new course remains far from certain. To that end president Mnangagwa will be closely scrutinised by many within the international community.  \u0026ldquoIf Mnangagwa is serious about reform, he must also repeal laws giving the government power to toss political opponents in jail and crack down on public protests as well as Mugabe-era legislation designed to roll back civil liberties, quash independent journalism, thwart the rule of law, and criminalise speech critical of the president, observed Siphosami Malunga, executive director of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa.  \u0026ldquoAs long as those statutes are on the books, the government can use them to silence critics and opponents, Malunga added in an article published just before the election.  Democratic change in Zimbabwe is undoubtedly possible. For the moment though the hopes of ordinary Zimbabweans have been tempered yet again by the forces arrayed against it and the determination of some to hold on to power. The weeks and months ahead will be another uncertain and difficult period for this long-suffering African nation."},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-backs-highland-games-for-children","story":"  Prince Charles\u0027 charity The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation is behind a project to establish links with local schools to promote the practice of traditional highland sports amongst youngsters in the north of Scotland.  A come-and-try session for children was delivered by Caithness secondary school pupils and held in John O\u0026rsquoGroats yesterday as part of the biggest-ever Mey Highland Games, which also boasted the first ever para and disability \u0026lsquoInvictus\u0026rsquo-style competitions, with competitors coming from the United States, Canada, France and, through Help For Heroes, across the UK.  The Prince is chieftain of the Mey Games, traditionally the smallest in Scotland, and has been behind efforts to reinvigorate the event in recent years.  Children were trained by the Scottish Highland Games Association (SHGA) president Charlie Murray and Sinclair Patience, a 2009 World Amateur Highland Games Champion and 2010 Junior Scottish Champion who has gone on to represent Scotland at many Highland games throughout the world.  Charlie Murray said: \u0026ldquoIt was heartening to see so many youngsters engaging in learning the basics of tossing the caber, tug-o-war, hammer-throwing, and weight-throwing. Our hope is, firstly, that they enjoy these activities and wish to carry on practising them and, secondly, that they are keen to compete in future Highland Games across the country, which form an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural calendar.

Owners of empty homes are being encouraged to bring them back into use, with measures including legislative changes, provision of funding and practical advice and assistance, the Scottish Government has said.  However the Scottish Liberal Democrats contrasted the figure provided by Mr Stewart with statistics on the number of long-term vacant private sector homes, which totalled more than 20,000 across Scotland at January 2018.  The party said it would take more than 50 years to refurbish the existing backlog at the same rate of progress since 2010.  The Lib Dems called for efforts to bring properties back into use to be fast-tracked, pointing to the cost difference between doing so and building new homes.  The Scottish Empty Homes Partnership says it costs between \u0026pound6,000 and \u0026pound25,000 to refurbish an empty home, compared with the average \u0026pound100,000 new-build cost, with the added benefit that the infrastructure and local services are already in place, the party said.  Data gathered using freedom of information requests to local authorities showed that at January 2018, there were 20,027 private sector homes which had been vacant for six months or more.  Of these, 5,583 were vacant for more than two years and 2,053 were vacant for more than five years.  Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"The Scottish Government should fast-track new efforts to get these properties back into use and introduce a new help-to-renovate loan to get existing vacant properties up to scratch.  \"With the right incentives and help, many of these could be resurrected to help alleviate the housing crisis, tackle homelessness and give young people a better chance of a home to call their own.\"  Mr Stewart said: \"Privately-owned empty homes can be a blight on communities and are a wasted resource.  \"Such homes can become empty for a number of reasons, which is why tailored individual support and advice for owners of these properties from local empty homes officers across the country is often the most effective way of bringing these homes back into use.  \"We recently doubled funding for the Scottish Empty Homes Partnership and network of empty homes officers. The dedicated support and advice provided has helped return 742 homes back into use in the last year, bringing the total to more than 3,200 since 2010.  \"In addition we are on track to deliver 50,000 affordable homes this term and are proud of our delivery of over 72,500 homes since 2007.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a96 upgrade report due","story":"        A report on the economic impact of upgrades to the A96 is expected to be published later this summer.

The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Sunday 5 Aug 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Sunday 5 Aug 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Sunday 5 Aug 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Sunday 5 Aug 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

No financial details have been disclosed for what is likely to have been a fairly substantial multi-million-pound deal.            The Barnetts business generated sales of £65.3 million last year and returned a £1.3m pre-tax profit.The Volvo franchise will be transferred to the John Clark Motor Group, as revealed earlier this week, and in turn Eastern Western Motor Group acquires the Nissan businesses in Dundee and Perth. Nissan in Dundee will be rehoused in the showroom vacated by Volvo.Douglas Brown, group managing director of Eastern Holdings, Eastern Western Motor Group’s parent company, said: “We have known Paul Barnett for many years and as a result it has been a quick, professional and seamless transaction.“Barnetts Motor Group and the Nissan franchises in Dundee and Perth will be a great addition to the Eastern Western Motor Group. It will give further depth and scale to our existing business and increase our points of representation of these franchises to five Nissan, four Volkswagen and two Mazda.“Similar to our recent acquisitions of Grassicks BMW and Mini in Perth and Phoenix Honda in Stirling, this further cements our relationship with three of our key partners and is in line with our strategy of growing and developing the group with existing brand partners in new geographical territories.            “We look forward to welcoming Barnetts’ teams and our new Nissan teams to the group and we will continue to trade under the Barnetts name in Dundee and St Andrews as it is synonymous with quality and excellent customer service.

The company has grown steadily and now employs 150 people throughout Tayside and Fife selling more than 4,000 vehicles every year and carrying out in excess of 25,000 services annually.It is understood that Paul Barnett will turn his focus to further developing the family’s property interests through Barnetts Properties.Eastern Western represents 12 franchises – Mercedes-Benz cars, Smart, Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicles, BMW, Mini, Lexus, Volkswagen, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda and Harley-Davidson."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4777920.1533233129!/image/image.jpg","title":"cameron wyllie hey teachers leave those cool kids alone","story":"        Teachers should be relaxed about some pupils being \u0026#8216cool\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 it\u0026#8217s a quality like being good-looking or charming, if not actually one of the big virtues, such as honesty, loyalty and kindness, writes former headteacher Cameron Wyllie.                Five years ago, I was on an October Week trip to New York City organised by the art-and-design department of the school where I was a senior manager.            The party consisted of me, two lovely pals of mine who taught art and design, and 25 students from the senior years.             We did a little bit of NYC tourist stuff and toured the politan Museum, The Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney. We saw a show. And, of course, we shopped. The hours for shopping were strictly regulated but we all got our fix and, let’s be honest, the typical pupil of art and design does like a nice outfit.Thus I found myself in the flagship store of Uniqlo on Fifth Avenue, while the young people threw themselves at arty T-shirts, puffer jackets and unusually patterned footwear.I, being approximately 18 times their age, contented myself browsing among the astonishingly cheap cardigans. Then I tried on a hat – a simple old-fashioned trilby in grey and burgundy. While I was considering the crumbling view in the mirror, one of the kids wandered past and said, “Good hat. You should buy that.” Now this was one of the seven boys on the trip, a young man of definite style who, like many of them, dressed with the easy detachment of fashionable youth.            So I did buy that hat (in the sale, $12) and every time I wear it, someone will say “I like your hat” or “great hat” or “Where did you get that hat?” or “You suit that hat”. It doesn’t matter what artfully contrived combination of other clothes I have on, the blooming hat gets the praise, the one thing that I didn’t really pick myself. I don’t know whether to be grateful or irritated.READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upThe truth is, some people are cool and most of us are not. A common complaint about young people in schools is that they spend way too much time trying to be cool – in the staffroom, wise old heads nod together and say of some errant child, “Aye that one’s too cool for school.”             It isn’t completely clear to anyone what ‘cool’ really means but essentially we all understand it – at a school leavers’ function some years back I used the word ‘cool’ in praise of one of the other young people there, which led to a discussion about who, exactly, was ‘cool’ in this group of people they had been with for years and years. They unanimously identified five or six people who combined some of the necessary characteristics and I could only concur with their selection. There were no hard feelings – only a few are chosen and the rest of us just have to get on with it.What teachers need to accept is that there’s nothing wrong with being cool – it’s just something that happens, like being very funny or having good hair. We need to stop railing about ‘coolness’ like we rail about smoking or idleness (it may be that some cool kids smoke and some are lazy but it’s not a necessary part of the conidition).             One school I know of went through such an ‘anti-cool campaign’ that it enlisted children to wear ‘Glad To Be Sad’ badges, which I personally felt to be going a bit far (though I imagine the badges themselves are now collectors’ items).This kind of approach towards a particular kind of teenager only encourages all teenagers to exaggerate the gulf in attitudes between themselves and their teachers heaven forfend, it may make them think that some of their teachers are a teeny bit jealous because they themselves were never cool, and never will be. READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertIncidentally, make no mistake – when a 16-year-old says “I think Mr Smith is cool”, it probably just means that Mr Smith does not impose the regulations regarding late homework, not that the young person would let Mr Smith choose their hair products.So let’s try to view ‘cool’ differently. Let’s see it as a desirable personal characteristic that some people have and let’s look at it positively. In educating young Scots about the state of the world they’re going into, let’s talk with them about all the different characteristics humanity shares, and instead of sneering at this vague but desirable state, let’s praise them all for what they give the world.  Of course, there’s a big range of personal virtues to choose from and ‘cool’, given its temporary nature, goes in the column with ‘good looks’ and ‘charm’, rather than being a big hitter like ‘honesty’, ‘loyalty’ or, biggest of all, ‘kindness’. Instead of being so negative and taking the risk of alienating pupils who, let’s face it, are usually popular with their peers, let’s accentuate the positive and gently point out what really matters in the long term whether you’re cool or not.  The American singer Courtney Marie Andrews puts it well: “And if your money runs out/And your good looks fade/May your kindness remain.” Heidies – there’s a good message for the first assembly of term!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778904.1533400957!/image/image.jpg","title":"alarm at rise in six figure golden goodbyes at scots councils","story":"        A rising number of high earners in Town Halls across Scotland have received six-figure \u0026#8220golden goodbye\u0026#8221 pay-offs, prompting questions about whether taxpayers are receiving \u0026#8220value for money\u0026#8221.                More than £135 million was shelled out by Scotland’s councils over the past two years. Hundreds of workers benefited from overall packages worth more than £100,000.            The rise in staff securing the most lucrative deals comes despite a fall in the total of cash paid out. A total of £67.1m was paid out by councils across Scotland in 2017/18, local authority annual accounts reveal. This is down from £72.7m in 2016/17. But the number of staff benefiting from lucrative six-figure deals has gone up from 152 to 171. This includes individual packages of up to £250,000.            Tory local government spokesman Alexander Stewart said: “This is a staggering amount of money to be spent on golden goodbyes. “Despite councils’ budgets continually being squeezed, it beggars belief that the amount of six-figure sums paid out have significantly increased. They often contest that their amounts are reducing. However in this long-running saga, they are not decreasing nearly quickly enough and this calls into question as to whether councils are receiving value for money.“Whilst some of these decisions can ultimately save money in the long-term, we must always ensure that public funds are being spent in a sensible manner.”Fife – the country’s third biggest council – had the highest overall exit package cost in Scotland with £11.7m paid out in total, while 34 staff enjoyed six-figure deals.Eileen Rowand, executive director at Fife Council, said the authority’s workforce had been reduced by around 12 per cent since 2010 on a “planned” basis.            “To meet the continuing financial pressures over the last few years, the council has improved efficiency, while minimising the impact of any reductions on frontline services,” she said.“We have reduced our workforce by around 12 per cent since 2010 on a planned and phased basis, and we know our overall workforce will continue to shrink. However, we have also invested in growth areas such as early years, where additional posts have been created to allow increased provision for pre-school children.“Exit package costs are incurred through retirements as well as redundancy. They’re subject to scrutiny and strict controls to make sure we reduce workforce costs and generate future savings. Although the costs are significant, it should be noted that not all of this is payable to the employee. A proportion is used to offset any impact on the pension fund in line with early retirement policy.” Aberdeen was next with overall costs of £11.3m, while 38 workers enjoyed packages worth more than £100,000.            Renfrewshire paid out £6.2m in exit deals as 25 staff left with six-figure packages.A Renfrewshire Council spokesperson said: “Voluntary redundancy and early retirement schemes are part of our long-term financial planning and we have secured savings of more than £40 million over the past five years, recovering up-front costs within two years.“Employees generally receive less than 15 per cent of the cost listed in the accounts, which is required by law to provide a notional cost taking into account pension payments over their estimated remaining life expectancy.”A total of 3,707 workers left council jobs over the past two years with exit deals. They include former Lothian Buses pair Norman Strachan and Bill Devlin.The figures fell by 335 in 2017/18 to reach 1686.            The packages are largely made up of the cash which individuals receive through redundancy payments, as well lump sums paid in compensation and additional strain on the council’s pension scheme.The prospect of an English-style cap to end the six-figure payouts in Scotland’s public sector had been considered by the Scottish Government last year after newly devolved powers gave ministers control over severance deals. The situation south of the Border sees a cap of £95,000 on people leaving public sector bodies and applies to “all types of arrangements” including any pension top-up deals.A spokesman for local government body Cosla said councils had undergone “incredible transformational change”, which had meant the departure of many senior posts to streamline operations. He said: “We need to see beyond the headline figures, this is not like councils handing over sums of money for people to leave from a zero base.“The figures used clearly include staff leaving who have paid into a pension scheme throughout their working lives and who are entitled to such pension payments.“Two final things also worth pointing out – firstly, these payments are not set by the councils and secondly, this is actually about spending now to save in the longer term.”John O’Connell, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, welcomed the decrease in the total amount paid out, but added: “The growing tendency to allow six-figure payouts is worrisome.“Across the public sector, there should be a cap on these ‘golden goodbyes’. The legislation for prohibiting exit payments above £95,000 is in place, but has not gone into force.“The sooner this limit is in place, the better. This kind of staggering excess should not be permissible in the public sector.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4778987.1533464526!/image/image.jpg","title":"independent scotland would need 20 years to remove trident ex snp adviser","story":"        An independent Scotland would be unable to remove Trident from Scottish waters for at least 20 years, a former defence adviser to the SNP has warned.                Instead of getting rid of the nuclear deterrent from the Clyde, an independent Scotland should explore leasing the Faslane facility to the UK government at around £1.1 billion per year.            The proposal has been made by Stuart Crawford in a paper which will be published this autumn looking at defence options in an independent Scotland post-Brexit.            Crawford argues that Trident would have to stay in the short to medium term because it would take two decades and £25 billion to build a facility comparable to Faslane south of the border.His proposal that Trident should stay until an alternative site can be built will be met with hostility from the SNP grassroots and leadership, which is passionately opposed to nuclear weapons.But Crawford, a defence commentator and former army officer, believes he is offering a pragmatic solution given the difficulties associated with getting rid \u2028of the deterrent, which supports around 7,000 military and civilian jobs in Scotland.Crawford believes that insisting on getting rid of nuclear weapons would pose a diplomatic problem for an independent Scotland in that the US would object.This, he believes, could see America block an independent Scotland’s accession to Nato.             Crawford’s paper will also outline the practical challenges of removing Trident from the Faslane/Coulport naval base on the Clyde and rehousing the weapons system south of the border. The most pressing would be replicating the bunkers specially designed for storing the nuclear warheads securely outside Scotland as well as the storage and jetty facilities for the submarines that carry them. Devonport, Falmouth, Port­land, Milford Haven and  Barrow-in-Furness have been suggested as possible replacements for Faslane. Crawford argues that all of them would require major work to be made suitable at a multi-billion pound cost. Crawford said: “The paper is going to say in essence that an independent Scotland cannot really sensibly insist on removal of the UK’s nuclear deterrent from its waters in the short to medium term.            “Therefore some pragmatic solution has to be adopted. The pragmatic solution is, in my opinion, to rent the Faslane nuclear facilities to the rest of the UK until such time as some other arrangement can be brought about.“If there is any chance of Scotland becoming an independent country in 2021, it would take the UK government at least 20 years to build the equivalent to the Faslane/Coulport facilities elsewhere in the UK. Then it would seem that some sort of leasing arrangement over 25 years or thereabouts would be sensible. “We reckon to build the new facility elsewhere in the UK, if a place can be found, it would probably cost somewhere in the region of £25 billion.“An educated estimate of what Scotland might be looking at to rent Faslane to the rest of the UK might be in the order of £1.1 billion per year.”Crawford acknowledged that his plan would not sit well with the SNP, but he argued that having Trident on Scottish soil would give the Scottish Government a strong hand in the negotiations to break up the UK.             “It is the most emotive defence-related issue in the whole independence debate. The difficult thing for the SNP leadership would be selling this to the foot soldiers. The broad base of the independence movement is very much grounded in the CND movement. I am completely sympathetic to that. “The SNP Government might look at this plan and say it doesn’t deliver our promise to remove Trident, but it would be the biggest bargaining chip that an independent Scotland could have.”Alex Salmond’s independence white paper prepared for the 2014 referendum aimed that Trident should be removed from Scotland within the first term of the Scottish Parliament immediately following independence. The blueprint said Scotland would become a non-nuclear Nato member, despite the organisation being a nuclear defence alliance. Under Salmond’s 2014 plans Faslane would be transformed into a conventional naval base and become joint headquarters of the Scottish defence forces. The white paper argued that removing the deterrent would prevent £100bn being “wasted” on maintaining a new nuclear weapons system.The prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum was put on the agenda by Nicola Sturgeon after the UK voted to leave the European Union. She has since “reset” her indyref2 plans, saying she would revisit the issue this autumn, assuming details of the UK’s Brexit deal are clearer by then.Earlier this year, the SNP published its Growth Commission, a document produced by the former SNP MSP and economist, Andrew Wilson, which acts as an independence blueprint. The Growth Commission said an independent Scotland’s defence budget would be 1.6 per cent of GDP, a saving on the UK’s plans for Scotland. But the document did not deal specifically with the Trident issue. The SNP’s opponents claimed Crawford’s model demonstrated that the SNP’s pledge to get rid of nuclear weapons lacked credibility.Douglas Ross, Scottish Conservative MP for Moray, said: “These comments add an element of realism to the SNP’s defence policy for an independent Scotland, something that has been sorely lacking for a long time. “However, the idea of the UK’s nuclear deterrent remaining on the Clyde for 20 years would not sit well with many rank and file nationalists.“It was never credible to think that Trident would just disappear from the Clyde following a Yes vote. There are thousands of Scottish jobs that depend on it. This is another example of policy and decision-making being driven by political dogma and the SNP’s obsession for separation at any cost.”An SNP spokeswoman said: “The SNP does not support Trident either as part of the UK or in an independent Scotland. We have continually opposed the renewal of Trident at the cost of conventional and cyber defences and continue to do so. In 2014 the Scottish Government set out a responsible approach to the removal of Trident from Scotland and in the event of independence securing the speediest and safest withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Scotland would be a priority for an SNP Scottish Government.” The Ministry of Defence declined to comment.

The Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP, who has been a staunch opponent of the UK Parliament’s rules and traditions since her election in 2015, said it was a “defunct” institution.            Ms Black made the comments during an event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe which covered a wide range of topics, from her views on Brexit, to online abuse and her own experiences as a young gay woman.            She told host Graham Spiers that while she enjoyed helping her constituents, she did not enjoy the other side of the job “and the crap that comes with it”.“I think Westminster itself as an institution is founded upon all the bits of being an MP I don’t like,” she said.READ MORE: Mhairi Black to make debut at Edinburgh Festival Fringe “It does not serve us, and in actual fact I would go so far as to say it’s not even a parliament - it is a club that masquerades itself.“It is designed in such a way that people are not held to account, it is designed in such a way that you can bleat and complain and vote against things, and it doesn’t make a blind bit of difference.            “It is designed in such a way that you will fall at every hurdle.READ MORE: Mhairi Black defends voting record at Westminster “It is as difficult as it possibly can be to get any change.”She continued: “As an institution it is defunct, it is not fit for purpose.”            Alongside her views on Westminster, Ms Black also voiced criticism of her fellow MPs, whom she once described in an interview as “sociopaths”.“Politics attracts quite often the worst of humanity,” she said.“It attracts people who are power hungry, who have all kinds of hidden agendas.“So, if you’ve got all of them in this institution that the public doesn’t understand, that the public assumes is too complicated for them, and they can legitimately get away with wasting hundreds of pounds under the guise of protocol and tradition, then of course they’re going to do that.”Asked about rumours she could quit Westminster, Ms Black, who was just 20 when she became the youngest MP three years ago, said she did not know whether she would stand for re-election.            Meanwhile, the Glasgow University graduate also addressed questions on her unlikely rapport with Tory MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.“In a colleague sense, I get on fine with the guy, but his views are vile,” Ms Black said.“People need to acknowledge this guy is dangerous, because for all the manners and all the niceness, he doesn’t think women should have the right to their body, he doesn’t think I should be allowed to get married because I’m gay.“That’s terrifying.” "},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

There could be a wreck and they\u0026#8217ve torn their net, and the net has come clear.\u0026#8221It\u0026#8217s not his fault if he\u0026#8217s lost a bit of his net. You can\u0026#8217t say that\u0026#8217s the fault of the fisherman.\u0026#8221\n.\n \u0026raquo\nas an ex fisherman i can put my take on the senario \u0026#8230.gear lost at sea whether it be by vessel  loss or snagged on the bottom or wreck and winter storms as in static gear \u0026#8230fishrmen cant forsee the outcome of a fishing trip or weather\nI would be more concerned with the massive amount of plastic in the oceans, especially plastic shopping bags.\nI was reading an article where a whale died with over 80 plastic bags taken out of its stomach.\nIt is not just plastic though, the oceans are becoming more acidic due to industrial waste being pumped into the oceans.\nThe oceans are also becoming slightly warmer, affecting many species of fish on migration roots or having to go deeper in depth, which directly affects birds, which dive, dependent on this source of food becoming out of reach.\nIt is estimated by the year 2050, the ice at the North Pole will be completely gone, and this will have a huge impact on sea currents, air streams but most of all, many, many species of life.\nPeople say climate change is normal, but what is not normal is the speed in which it is happening, this is directly caused by human activity and nothing else.\nThe misuse of plastic is a hazard to wildlife as everyone knows. It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bressay ferry service suspended ","story":"\n\nThe incident occurred at around 11am after the vessel experienced an engine failure while approaching the berth.\n, took the boat under tow and brought her back to berth in Lerwick where the vehicles on board had to reverse off.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSunday 5 Aug 2018 11:37 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Everything will be included in the exhibition at the end of the project.”\n\nThe Caravan Gallery has recently spoken at The Martin Parr Foundation on its approach to engaging communities and has

paisley by election petition to be set up in three north antrim towns","story":"\nThe petition to remove Ian Paisley as North Antrim MP and force a by-election will be available for signing at three locations in the constituency, it has been confirmed.\n\n                \nIn a public notice in today’s News Letter, the Electoral Office reveals that the petition will be available to sign in north Antrim’s three main towns – Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nIan Paisley has vowed to stand again for election if he is forced into a by-election\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMembers of the public who want to force a by-election – in which Mr Paisley has made clear he will stand for re-election – will be able to sign from 9am next Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition will be open to sign until 5pm each week day at the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney, the Seven Towers Leisure Centre in Ballymena and the Sheskburn House Recreation Centre in Ballycastle.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe petition will remain open to sign for six weeks, until 19 September.\n\nThere will also be evening signings – something required by the legislation governing recall petitions – on September 6 and 13, when the petition can be signed up until 9pm.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea – who is responsible for the process – had discretion under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to designate up to 10 locations within the constituency for the petition to be signed.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has clarified that Ian Paisley has not left the party after some confusion yesterday in the wake of Parliament redesignating the North Antrim MP as an independent.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe party confirmed that Mr Paisley remained suspended, rather than having been expelled, and as part of that the party had withdrawn the whip from him.\n\nThat puts him in the same category as MPs such as Ivan Lewis, who is suspended by Labour and is listed as an independent.\n\nThe recall process was automatically triggered when Mr Paisley was given a suspension of 30 sitting days – the longest on record since at least 1949 – over “serious misconduct” relating to taking free luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then lobbying on behalf of the regime without declaring that they had given the valuable gifts to himself and his family.\n\nThe DUP veteran apologised for not declaring the holidays but insisted to Parliament’s standards commissioner that his letter asking the prime minister to change UK policy at the UN to that favoured by Sri Lanka did not amount to lobbying for the regime.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition to remove Mr Paisley will have to be signed by 7,547 people – 10% of the eligible North Antrim electorate – if there is to be a by-election.\n\nUnlike the situation with an election, any voter – not just those who can provide a legitimate reason for not being able to vote in person – will be able to apply to sign the petition by post.\n\nThat rule, about which DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has expressed concern, is in place because, unlike an election, it will be known that anyone going into the signing place will be there to sign the petition, reducing the typical anonymity around an election.\n\nParties wanting to campaign for people to sign the petition will have to register if they are planning to spend more than £500.\n\n

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix.

I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37183561.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pe_00505565.jpg","title":"alex kane only a fool would dismiss the idea that british government wont spring another surprise","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Irrespective of how strong an argument or position, maybe it is always wrong to assume that circumstances cannot or will not change. My view remains that the Union will survive. But it will not survive because Robinson, Sammy Wilson and I say so.\n\nIt will only survive if unionism, collectively and individually, makes a strong case, sells the message, expands the support base and prepares for all eventualities. That is all Robinson is saying.\n\nWhen I suggested in an article a couple of weeks before the 2017 Assembly election that there was a possibility - albeit a slim one - unionists could lose their overall majority, a leading DUP MLA told me, \"Don\u0027t be silly, Alex, that\u0027s not going to happen. \n\n\"Why would you even write something like that?\"\n\nWell, they lost that majority. Unionists don\u0027t have a majority of either Council or Assembly seats across Belfast (24/60 BCC and 6/20 NIA). The overall vote for candidates who declared themselves as pro-Union/unionist at the last few elections has hovered uncomfortably close to or slightly lower than the 50% barrier.\n\nWhile recent opinion polls haven\u0027t given a consistent trend on support for Irish unity, they do suggest that what happens regarding the final Brexit deal could have a significant impact on two or three key demographics.\n\nGiven that sort of background, it would be a very sanguine or very stupid unionist who would argue that unionists shouldn\u0027t give serious consideration to a number of possibilities. The primary one, as Robinson says, is that a border poll is possible, particularly under a Labour government. It is the Secretary of State who makes the call - not unionists, not the DUP, not even Sammy Wilson. I would prefer that the leaders of unionism had given some thought to the possibility and made some sort of preparation for the campaign rather, than as Robinson says, burying their heads in the sand until \"only the soles of their feet are visible above the surface\".\n\nRobinson, Wilson and the rest of us from that generation will remember the body blow dealt to unionism by the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. They will remember the despair. They will remember how close we came to a tipping point. They will remember that something dismissed as an impossibility by the leadership of unionism at the time happened: happened over their heads and without any consultation.\n\nOnly a fool, a blinkered, irresponsible, thoroughly delusional fool would believe that a British government would not, again, spring another monumental shock upon unionism. And only a unionist of monumental stupidity would refuse to discuss, let alone prepare for that eventuality. \"Contingency planning is a judicious safety-net. Better by far to plan for adverse possibilities, no matter how remote, than be left clueless and unprepared if our hopes and evaluations are wrong\". Robinson is right. He wrote something similar in the joint UUP/DUP response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement published in June 1987 (The Task Force Report: An End To Drift):\n\n\"The temptation in such circumstances might be to do nothing. However we would consider this the ultimate abdication of responsibility.\"\n\nTo be honest, not much was done. Unionism paid the price of that ongoing abdication of responsibility by the leadership of both parties. Robinson, perhaps mindful of how the report he co-authored was never given the consideration it deserved, is right to remind unionists, all of us, of the continuing perils of not being prepared.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast pride parade 2018 thousands take to streets to celebrate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ian paisley supporters call meeting to show the world that his friends stand behind him following suspension","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Sinn Fein of course have led the charge, proudly proclaiming in the Irish News: \u0027Sinn Fein Vows to unseat Paisley\u0027.\n\n\"Many see this as their opportunity to oust Northern Ireland\u0027s most gifted voice in Parliament on Brexit.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tenor bocelli to perform for pope at dublin event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

privilege for our soul it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world\nAndrea Bocelli\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe singer said: “Singing before Pope Francis is a privilege for our soul it is an honour for what the Supreme Pontiff represents in the world.\n\n“For the indescribable human fragility, typical of the average man such as myself, it brings me great pleasure and immense satisfaction to even have the privilege to be close to a person of such exceptional importance and grace.\n\n“It is a joy to be able to offer my most modest contribution on the occasion of this grand meeting and moment of reflection about the family.\n\n“The family remains the strongest building block of society, a cluster of affection, and a privileged space in which one can teach and learn – in every action – how to choose a life that leads toward the greater good.”\n\nFather Timothy Bartlett, secretary general of the World Meeting of Families 2018 event, said he was delighted.\n\n“He will bring so much to our gathering not just because of his wonderful talent but because of his love for his faith.\n\n“We are honoured that he has taken time out of an intensely busy schedule to come to Ireland to be part of our global celebration of family life.”\n\nBocelli has met Pope Francis and has performed for him on more than one occasion including at the last World Meeting of Families which took place in Philadelphia in 2015.\n\nHe is a devout Catholic and he has spoken openly many times about the importance of faith and how it takes first place in his life.\n\nHe has regularly donated his time and talent to causes and events that he is passionate about.\n\nBocelli will join other well-known acts already announced for the event including Nathan Carter, Daniel O’Donnell and Moya Brennan.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"focus on ethnic consumer pays off for estee lauder companies","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

Today is the launch of the FUNMI FETTO BEAUTY BOX which I have curated especially for my fellow women of colour in collaboration with @esteelaudercompanies 💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿 So what inspired it? Well for many years, I have been in the privileged position of trying and testing the world’s best beauty products in the name of journalism. And so everywhere I go, women of colour are ALWAYS asking me for my beauty recommendations. There is a lack of representation (In magazines, in campaigns, in product ranges etc etc) And while there is progress, I have regular experiences that remind me there is still work to be done. Also despite the plethora of beauty boxes out there, I hadn’t come across one that actually includes this demographic 🙄. So I wanted to do something that in a small way celebrates great brands and products that actually take a range of skin tones and ethnicities into consideration.

and Dorset coast, such as Gosport, are most likely to feel the heat on Saturday, while the hottest areas on Sunday are expected to be around London stretching north to the Midlands.\n\n\nPlenty of

2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures could soar even higher early next week, with highs of 32C (89.6F) possible around London on Monday and Tuesday. \n\nBritons making the most of the balmy weekend were urged to stay “sun sensible” amid the high UV levels. \n\nHowever, not all of the UK will be gazing into clear blue skies – in Scotland and Northern Ireland clouds are likely with some thick enough to bring patchy rain to the north and west of Scotland. \n\nThe north-west, south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland, while England and Wales stay generally dry and warmer. \n\n\nWe don’t know if you’ve heard… but it’s VERY… VERY hot!\n\nBe sun sensible this summer\n\n🌞🌞🌞 🌶️🌶️ 🌶️🌶️🌶️\n— EEAST Ambulance (@EastEnglandAmb) \nAugust 4, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England’s current August record – 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.\n\nHowever, the intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday, as conditions turn “fresher and more changeable”, the Met Office said. \n\nIt comes amid an intense European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the sun most intensely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert.\n\nEarlier this week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, with temperatures peaking at 45.2C (113.4F) near Abrantes, a town in the centre of the country.\n\nEmergency services have issued a red alert until Sunday, with medical staff and firefighters on standby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA boy jumps from a platform over the water at La Concha beach in northern Spain (Alvaro Barrientos/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 400 firefighters and five water-dropping aircraft are battling a wildfire in southern Portugal’s Algarve region.\n\nIn Spain, heat warnings have been issued for 41 of the country’s 50 provinces as temperatures are expected to reach up to 44C (111.2F).\n\nIn northern Europe, Sweden is still under threat from wildfires, which in recent weeks have extended into the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe Met Office said it was unlikely that the overall European highest temperature recorded – 48C (118.4F) in Athens, Greece in 1977 – would be beaten.\n\nBritish holiday-makers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"new organ donation law could save 700 more

Strabane District Council and City of Derry Spartans have announced this week that the race will act as a qualifier for the NI squad for the inaugural Commonwealth Half Marathon Championships on Sunday October 7\nth\n in Cardiff.\n\nThe race has already been confirmed as the host event for the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships which has swelled demand for places as Race Director Gerry Lynch explained:\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])

entries to date as well as 40 plus relay teams of three which is a big increase on last year and indicates that the individual limit will be reached soon,” he revealed.\n\n“The NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships and qualification for the Commonwealth Championships is a big carrot for the top male and female entrants to aim for and this should add to the quality of the field and the up front competition on the day.\n\n“The event sells out every year and with the continued growth of athletics and running clubs locally our advice to anyone intending to take part is to register online now to avoid disappointment when entries close on August 13\nth\n.”\nThe Waterside Half Marathon is one of the longest running athletics events in Ireland with a scenic route that takes in both sides of the River Foyle, passing many of the city’s historic landmarks including its famous walls and the Guildhall.\nThe 13.1 mile course has runner, wheelchair and three person relay categories, the event is open to athletes of all levels and abilities and all entrants to the main race must be aged 17 or over on race day.\nA number of groups have already registered for the event to raise funds for their chosen charities including a group of over 20 runners from Firstsource Solutions in Derry who are taking part in aid of Foyle Search and Rescue.\nThe event includes a team of 12 pacers who will be identifiable at the race start by helium balloons displaying their times.\nPacer times start at 1 hour and 30 minutes and rise in increments of 15 minutes up to 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n“The pacers are all experienced runners who have studied the terrain of the course beforehand and they have always been spot on with their timings,” Gerry explained.\n“The beauty of having different pacers is that if peoples’ goals change during the race they have the option to slow down or speed up to join the pacers behind or in front.\n“Pacers will be walking around the start line for half an hour before the race and will be identifiable by helium balloons and t shirts showing their time so runners can file in behind them at the race start.”\n“It’s a spectator friendly route with the start and finish at St Columb’s Park and people can stand anywhere along the river bank on the west bank and enjoy the action.\n“Between the Peace Bridge and Coshowen runners will be running in both directions so that is a particularly good place to enjoy the action.”\nAll participants will receive a specially commissioned Waterside Half Marathon medal and race t shirt.\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13\nth\n August 2018 and you can register online now
