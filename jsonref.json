For accommodation, car hire or excursions, your travel insurance may cover the cost.If you travel against FCO advice this will likely invalidate your insurance policy. If your cruise itinerary is changed you may be able to get a refund or credit, but this is not guaranteed and it is likely your trip would need to be significantly impacted.         Heathrow Airport\u0027s Terminal 5 area looked clear of all but a few passengers earlier today. Pictured: Information on passengers arriving from northern ItalyWhat if I don\u0027t want to risk travelling?Insurers will not cover what they term ‘disinclination’ to travel – even if the reason is a legitimate concern such as a pandemic.So if the FCO has not advised against all but essential travel to your destination – as it has with China and Italy currently – you may struggle to make a claim.The exception may be if your doctor has advised you not to travel to an area because you have an underlying medical condition. But insurers will make decisions on a case-by-case basis and you will need a doctor’s note.If you have failed to inform your insurer of pre-existing medical conditions, they could refuse your claim. It may also be worth asking the tour operator or airline if they will offer you alternative dates as a gesture of goodwill.I haven\u0027t booked travel insurance - can I still get it?The Association of British Insurers had said that someone buying travel insurance now should be covered if the FCO later advises against travel to that country.However, experts say it is now highly unlikely that holidaymakers will be able to find a policy without an exclusion for coronavirus-related claims. Some insurers have even stopped selling travel cover. If you have an annual policy you should check with your insurer before booking trips.Ensure you have ‘travel disruption’ cover. It would also be sensible to opt for a policy with ‘scheduled airline failure’ protection.         Insurers will not cover what they term ‘disinclination’ to travel – even if the reason is a legitimate concern such as a pandemic. Pictured: Heathrow on ThursdayWill my credit card provider pay out?If you are struggling to get a refund for a cancelled flight, accommodation, car hire or excursion you may be able to claim your money back.Under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, your lender is jointly liable for spending over £100 if you do not receive the goods and services promised.If you paid by debit card you may be able to ask your bank to reverse the transaction by making a chargeback request.What if I paid using air miles?If you booked a flight using air miles and now need to cancel, you should get your points back under standard cancellation rules. You may need to pay an administration fee. If you booked a hotel using loyalty points, you should usually get them back if you cancel 48 hours in advance.Will my insurer pay if I\u0027m stuck abroad?First contact your tour operator or airline to see if they can move your return date or help with accommodation.Should your trip be cut short or if you are confined to your hotel on medical advice, you may also be able to claim for curtailment.If the Government advice is to come home, call your airline and the FCO for information about possible repatriation flights.         You should also be able to make a claim if it is a close family member or travelling companion who falls ill – or, in the very worst case, dies (stock photo)What if an event I\u0027m going to is axed?You should receive a refund – although you may encounter difficulties if you bought them via a third party.

You may be able to resell the tickets.Will my EHIC still cover me in Europe?The European Health Insurance card is expected to remain in force until the end of December and should work as normal if you get coronavirus.

There is no guarantee when things will go back to normal travel-wise.With travel providers desperately trying to attract customers with cheap deals, it might be tempting to book in the hope that everything will be fine in a few months.However, it will now be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find a travel insurance policy that will provide cover should you later need to cancel as a result of the virus.

It was horrific,” the tennis star says.But it was this newfound interest in art that led him to meet the British artist Maggi Hambling, whose new portrait of Murray is to go on display at the National Portrait Gallery. To this day, the pair disagree on how long she made him pose in his Wimbledon whites, while pretending to serve and return with his forehand and backhand.“It was actually a very short time,” Hambling insisted. “He says 10 minutes, I say less.”Murray recalled it slightly differently. “I kind of thought I would basically just be sitting. Posing in these positions … felt like quite a long time for me. I was there for three to four hours in total, we did have breaks. It was difficult, it was a physical morning.”The affection between artist and sportsman was obvious, the portrait a result of mutual admiration and now friendship.Murray’s disastrous attempt to have a go at art himself was a result of finding his wife’s canvases and paint in the house.“It’s like most things really, you think, ‘I could do that’ or ‘that’s not difficult’,” he said. “My wife was out that night, I was by myself in the house. She came back from dinner and was like, ‘What the hell have you done?’”The Murray artworks are, sadly, probably lost to the world. “Honestly they were horrendous, really bad.”The experience spurred him to try to understand and appreciate art, which led to him meeting and becoming a fan and friend of Hambling. The admiration is mutual. “I’ve been a great fan of Andy’s forever really,” said Hambling, who loves tennis. “When I was a child, Americans always won everything and what I admire about Andy is that he’s his own person, he is other things as well as a tennis player.”Hambling recalled Murray’s first visit to her Suffolk studio. “I was really impressed at the way you naturally looked at paintings. Not many people go up close and look at the detail and go back again… You seem to do that quite naturally.”For Murray the friendship has also been an education. “I’m quite naive when it comes to art so when I spend time with Maggi I tend to ask lots of questions and understand it better,” he said“He asks very difficult questions,” said Hambling. “I really have to think. Normally I don’t think I just pick up the brush and hope for the best. Andy does pepper me with difficult questions.”The painting enters the national collection thanks to a cash gift from an anonymous donor. Along with two preparatory drawings it will be on display in London until May, after which it travels to Edinburgh where it will go on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.Hambling is a star of British art although she does have her detractors. The former theatre critic Charles Spencer once wrote that two of the sculptures “he would like to smash” were Hambling’s sculpture of Oscar Wilde behind St Martins-in-the-Fields in London (“Hideous is too gentle a word to describe it”) and her famous four-metre high Scallop on the beach at Aldeburgh, a tribute to Benjamin Britten.Murray, however, is a huge admirer and now owns seven Hambling paintings. He said the sittings, last September, were fun albeit not what he was expecting.“I made him do these impossible poses,” said Hambling. “He brought his whites because, of course, it had to be Wimbledon. If you think about tennis you’re either hitting the ball against the sky or against the grass so Andy’s movement between the two is very much what the painting is about.“Most people’s idea of a portrait is someone sitting on a chair, their head and shoulders. That’s not how it is for me. Andy is about playing tennis. You are the most miraculous tennis player, that’s why it had to work as a painting about movement.”Both of them think there are similarities between artists and tennis players. “It is all hand and eye,” said Hambling. “Andy is obviously a complete lunatic giving his life to tennis as I’m a lunatic giving my life to art, but it is hand and eye but most importantly heart. You have to be completely obsessed.”Murray said tennis players and artists were both at their best when they were in the zone, not thinking and letting things just happen. “When you start to overthink things it doesn’t work.”Murray, a double Wimbledon winner and Olympic gold medallist, is not known for his effusiveness so when asked what emotions he felt looking at the painting he was typically low key.“I really like it. Because it is just very different to what I expected. When you speak about a portrait I didn’t expect to see something like that. I like it and obviously because I know Maggi really well too, it just means a little bit more. There’s a personal relationship there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2735eb7f6c647e035fb787802fb09c58760e3b25/214_331_6445_3867/master/6445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e5458615426d32b2812c10209dc274b","title":"metallica james hetfield ross halfin best photograph","story":"‘Their drummer Lars Ulrich called me up and I kept avoiding him – I thought he looked like an idiot. But I shot them in 1984 and have worked with them ever since’My aim when shooting a show is to give somebody something they would not normally have seen. And to create an image that is unusual or exciting, so when people who went to the show look at it, they see something that’s special. People who shoot shows tend to panic, but if you do that, you get nothing. Stand back and wait. Think about what you’re doing – I learned that from Fin Costello. I don’t find it hard to get original images from live shows, because I know what I’m doing – I’ve done it for so long. Nowadays, a lot of bands want to control everything and they ban photographers from shows. Yet they’re quite happy, having thrown out the people doing it properly, to let anybody take bad pictures or film it on an iPhone.I first shot Metallica in 1984. Their drummer, Lars Ulrich, would call me me up, and I kept avoiding him. I’d seen pictures of him, and I thought he was just this Danish guy who looked like a complete idiot. But then Metallica’s manager, Peter Mensch, called me and said: “Listen, stop being such an asshole. Go to San Francisco and shoot my new band.” So I did, and that was the start of my relationship with them. In fact, the only reason I ended up shooting Metallica was because they wanted Iron Maiden’s photographer – I was working for them at the time. To Metallica, Led Zeppelin (who I also worked with) meant nothing. But Iron Maiden meant something and Metallica wanted their photographer. I’ve worked with them ever since. I’ll give the group their due: they are very conscious of who they are, what they do and how they want to be photographed. But they are also very open to doing different things.I am a rock photographer, not just hard rock or metal. I am particularly known for metal because I worked for Kerrang! magazine in the 80s, but that was more because instead of going to Leeds to shoot the Pet Shop Boys, I could go to Hawaii to do Aerosmith. Where would you rather go? And at the time the National Union of Journalists made sure that if you shot colour you were paid twice as much as for black and white, and Kerrang! was full colour.The worst photoshoot I ever did was the first time I worked with Led Zeppelin in 1979. I was young, and really impressed. Robert Plant walked up to me and said: “Do you know how to take a Robert Plant photo?” He poked me in the chest and said, quite nastily: “Quickly.” I was shooting a cover for Sounds magazine, and I did the shoot, but I was so nervous that I did Plant’s photoshoot, not mine. I did what he wanted, which resulted in a very boring picture. I came away and I thought: “I will never let anyone do that to me again,” and I never have. I was so naive that he completely threw me. Don’t let them do that to you, because if you do, you are just going to get a boring portrait.Training: A course in fine art at Wimbledon College of Art.High point: My Jimmy Page picture getting displayed in the National Portrait Gallery.Low point: Shooting the first Spice Girls US tour. The band were OK, it was everyone around them.Top tip: Always take control. Never let the subject take control.• Ross Halfin was due to speak on the Super Stage at The Photography Show in Birmingham, which has been postponed until September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9b106770d66a5a1b1ebd27bb78489387819002/64_128_4663_5300/master/4663.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d50f8743ef8281561a0316b77bc422e 1400w","title":"a thousand moons by sebastian barry review an ambitious sequel to days without end","story":"Narrated by a young Native American woman, the follow-up to Barry’s Costa winner again displays the rare gifts of a natural storytellerSebastian Barry’s new novel extends again the great web of story and history he has been weaving for years now out of the fictional Dunne and McNulty tribes, picking up fragments of anecdote and character from the past of his own family, developing and transforming them. Barry is a poet and playwright as well as a novelist, and he is Ireland’s second laureate for fiction, following Anne Enright. His ambitious and Balzacian novel-project – which never feels programmatic, each book seeming to grow organically to become part of the whole – has assembled over time a richly significant map of the Irish diaspora, and of the ways Irish lives have intersected with global history, alongside the drama of their history unfolding at home. In The Secret Scripture Roseanne McNulty approaches her 100th birthday in a Roscommon psychiatric hospital in The Temporary Gentleman Jack McNulty makes a life for himself in colonial and postcolonial Ghana. In A Long Long Way, set in the first world war, because Willie Dunne serves in the British army, he is seen as a traitor by some in Ireland he is later caught up fighting the rebels in the Easter Rising.In A Thousand Moons we’re reunited with Thomas McNulty and John Cole from his last book, the magnificent Costa-winning Days Without End, which was set against the American Indian wars and civil war. At the end of that novel Thomas and John, soldiers and cross-dressers and a loving couple, have settled down on Lige Magan’s tobacco farm outside Paris, a small town in West Tennessee. There they compose an oddly assorted family, including ex-slaves Rosalee Bouguereau and her brother Tennyson, and Thomas and John’s adopted daughter, Winona, a Native American orphan whose real name, she tells us, is Ojinjintka, which means “rose” in the Lakota language. Oddly assorted families, in which race and gender and role are all mixed up, are at the heart of Barry’s ideal. Even the wicked and violent men in his novels, in fact, won’t lie down neatly inside their category description.It is Winona who narrates A Thousand Moons, picking up the story when she is becoming a young woman and Thomas and John aren’t good-looking boys any longer, but hardworking men beginning to turn grey – though Thomas still puts on a dress for special occasions. Winona is clever and John has taught her how to read and write she’s working for lawyer Briscoe, who is committed to reconstruction and justice for all, at a time when postwar hopes of a new south are beginning to crumble and the defeated Confederates are agitating, stirring racial violence. At the novel’s opening Winona is hoping to marry Jas Jonski, a Polish boy who works at the local store and doesn’t seem to mind that she’s a Native American, unlike most of the Paris inhabitants. “I was just the cinders of an Indian fire in the eyes of the town. Indians in bulk were long gone from Henry County. Cherokee. Chickasaw. Folks didn’t like to see an ember drifting back.”Then one night Winona is raped – although neither she nor Rosalee has a word for what’s happened, and the men in their household take a long time to catch on. Winona was drinking whiskey and has no clear memory of who raped her, though she knows it may have been Jas. The rest of the novel is the complicated fallout from that violent despoiling.Barry prefers moral complication to the righteous simplicities of “us” and “them”, just as he’s always written against the grain of certain pieties in Irish history. In The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty, the young Eneas joins the Royal Irish Constabulary, then witnesses the murder of a fellow policeman: Irish rebels sentence him to death, and he escapes to a lifetime of wandering in exile. Willie Dunne in A Long Long Way is torn in anguish between his loyalist father and the passionate conviction of the rebels. Political conflict isn’t seen in the abstract, but gets expressed along the fault lines in families, or inside iniduals. Winona knows that Thomas and John took part in the massacre of her Lakota family, though they saved her life afterwards, and have devoted themselves ever since to her wellbeing: “They both gave me the wound and healed it, which is a hard fact in its way.” When, in A Thousand Moons, Winona goes in disguise as a boy to the camp of Confederate renegades, and meets her enemy Aurelius Littlefair in his cabin, she fears she’s entering “into the very hall of evil” but in fact his room has “an air of clemency and order”, and Aurelius treats her with grave courtesy, explaining his aspiration, in a perfect world, to have all the children educated. The sheriff’s deputy Frank Parkman is mostly bigoted and vicious, but in one episode, when he thinks Winona is a Native American boy, he brings her a bowl of stew and asks very gently if she’d mind kissing him. “If you don’t care to, I don’t mind one whit … Hey, Cochise … You not offended?” Barry is interested in how innocence can persist inside an inidual, mysteriously all mixed up with their violence and wrong ideas and wrongdoing.If this novel isn’t as persuasive as Days Without End, it’s partly due to the eternal problem with sequels the fresh action is overshadowed by what has come before, and there has to be quite a bit of explaining of backstory. Some characters – particularly Thomas and John – are handed down wholesale from the past, rather than made complex in new treatment, and perhaps because of that the household at Lige Magan’s farm can feel a little too good to be true, a folksy dream of toleration and forbearance in the midst of a dark world. We have it all through Winona’s telling, and she’s passionately invested in their goodness it may be because he’s chosen a woman’s voice for his narration that Barry makes it at moments a little too sweet.Late in the night the way people do we settled down like horses after a long gallop and enjoyed the blazing fire and felt pretty comfortable in our dark cabin under the stars and for that while my heart was not sore and Lige Magan turned to the medley of lullabies and laments on his fiddle and the four strings vibrated their lovely music and our hearts were full. And when Winona falls in love with Peg from the renegade camp, Peg needs to exist with more solidity on the page, rather than just through Winona’s besotted description: “If you could make honey hover in the air it would be Peg. If you could take a sliver of the wildest river and make it a person it would be Peg.”Mostly, however, the writing brings off Barry’s characteristic balancing act, between the lyrical telling that comes to him naturally and the grubby, tormenting world he wants to show us. “You just had to look like you done something wrong in America and they would hang you, if you were poor.” The politics and power struggles, male brutality and race rhetoric in this novel are imagined with an intuitive, unsparing realism – and so is its material detail: “great wheel gouges hewn into the soil”, a taken-aback black bear in the woods, dirty suds from the women’s washing “fleeing downriver”, Aurelius Littlefair with a “mouth of forsaken teeth”. Barry’s prose always has this sturdy yet dreamy quality of a fairy story, even when he takes us into the darkest places of cruelty and violation – or perhaps especially when he takes us there. Because of something unguarded in his writing, and his idiom borrowed from ordinary speech and proverbial wisdom, we can trust him to touch the terrible stories from our collective past without betraying them, or turning them merely into clever art. His work reminds us how much we need these rare gifts of the natural storyteller, for reckoning with our past and present.• A Thousand Moons by Sebastian Barry is published by Faber (RRP £18.99).

Some changes will stickFor days now, the list has been growing in my head. All the meetings, all the working coffees, everyone I bumped into in the street over the last week or two. The dinners with old friends, the book launch party, the kids’ sleepovers, the dog walks with neighbours and cups of tea made for the builders. Even a boring middle-aged life, living in the country and working much of the time from home, is more sociable than it looks.And although I stopped shaking hands with interviewees 10 days ago, to avoid any chance of passing on a virus I almost certainly don’t have, even Lady Macbeth-like levels of hand washing suddenly don’t feel quite socially responsible enough. Never mind “dancing like nobody’s watching”, as the twee motivational quotes have it “living life as if an NHS contact tracer is counting how many people you’re breathing germs over” suddenly seems a more appropriate motto.Nobody should be blamed for unwittingly infecting others, obviously we’re all in this together. But we are entering the next stage of coronavirus now, where life will change and perhaps dramatically. Diaries will empty almost as fast as train carriages, as all but essential meetings are scrapped. But that’s just the beginning, as the shutters come down all over Europe. We may be entering a grim, involuntary social experiment revealing which everyday habits and practices we’d miss if they were gone, and which could be swept away surprisingly easily.This week Jenny Brown, the head of City of London School for Girls, called for private schools like hers to dump GCSEs in favour of interesting project work that doesn’t turn the already anxious teenage years into a pressure cooker. Crazy idea? Teachers already struggling to motivate reluctant pupils, even with the threat of exams, may think so and it could be disastrous for less academic kids whose highest academic qualification will be a GCSE. Yet if the worst case infection scenarios come true, then by mid-May squeezing thousands of children into exam halls might make no sense.It’s no longer unthinkable that this year’s exams might need to be scrapped or postponed, and suddenly an argument that has been going round in circles for years about whether testing at 16 really makes sense – because ultimately ditching it always feels like too much of an upheaval, unfair on the children who would become guinea pigs – changes. We may be entering an era where things that once seemed impossible, become almost impossible to avoid.Sadly for the theory that crises are opportunities in disguise, the changes that may be coming won’t always be benign or within our control. A major coronavirus pandemic may mean social consequences we never foresaw and painful shifts away from economic models on which many jobs depend – on top of the deaths and suffering the virus itself will bring. But this crisis could end up being less like the banking crash and more like a war, an event throwing everything high enough into the air that some of it never returns to Earth.Women taking over men’s work in factories and offices was meant to be a sticking plaster solution to get us through the second world war, but when the fighting was over women balked at returning to narrow domestic lives. Rationing was just a pragmatic response to food shortages but it accidentally created a giant control group of children all raised on the same diet, whose health outcomes obesity researchers would study for decades to come. Wartime desperation accelerated the development of everything from antibiotics to radar to sexual health services free at the point of need, years before the NHS was established (it was a first world war outbreak of venereal disease among soldiers that led to the setting up of the first clinics in 1916).Since few in 1939 would have predicted a movement for women’s liberation, all predictions of how this outbreak will change us should be taken with a bucket of salt. But ideas long parked in the “too difficult” box may begin breaking out of it.After the 2008 banking crash, some firms of City lawyers or accountants whose work had abruptly dried up started asking for volunteers to work four-day weeks and take a pay cut. Part-time work went from being seen as something only working mothers did, to a heroic gesture men could also feel good about when the crisis passed, some chose to stick with the new working pattern.What stops most people taking Fridays off now is that they can’t afford to earn less, while most employers can’t face reorganising the whole office to pack the same work into fewer, more productive days. But some companies facing a catastrophic slump in demand are already pleading for volunteers to cut their hours, while others will end up making radical changes to the way they operate in order to cope with the numbers going off sick.If the need to share work around during the Great Depression helped kill the six-day week, this virus may knock another brick out of the wall of Monday to Friday working. And how many of those cancelled meetings, or mothballed conferences, will be actively missed?The existing shift from an analogue world to a digital one will surely speed up too. Rather than risk exchanging germs, we’ll shop online, FaceTime the grandparents instead of visiting, pay electronically rather than handle cash, stockpile ebooks for long dull days indoors.Politics, too, will change. There has long been stiff resistance in parliament to letting MPs vote electronically from wherever they happen to be only after a heavily pregnant Tulip Siddiq was pushed through the lobbies in a wheelchair were proxy votes for new parents reluctantly granted. But keeping elderly peers cooped up in the House of Lords seems almost irresponsible now, and e-voting could be the safest way of passing legislation in an epidemic. If it works, then can it be long before the rest of us are voting online in general elections, not walking to polling stations?And if all this sounds like a lonely, antiseptic way of living, then perhaps it will also make us appreciate the human contacts that matter. My son was longing for school closures until his teachers explained that the contingency plan is to set daily lessons online instead all the same grind, but no break times with your friends (and no staffroom camaraderie).What we will miss most in a crisis, I suspect, is each other. But don’t be surprised, when things eventually return to normal, if it isn’t quite the normal we knew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5b9d0b329647238627e5c6cc37b3918988dae2/3_0_1638_983/master/1638.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=7fac3627758cc850ae90e88a60c95019","title":"one year after christchurch we seek solace in community and being unapologetically muslim","story":"In many ways, life has not changed for many of my Muslim friends and me because the world has not changed. However, hope existsA body on the floor of a place of worship is still a bodyThe fall, and the thump, and the snapThere is nothing beautiful about the way the blood sprays the sacred wallsThe way it hangs itself a tapestry of death and despair…And we dig deepWe try to find the beauty in tragedyIman Etri, Bankstown Poetry Slam, March 2019The scars of the Christchurch massacre linger. Time has carpeted the pain. Slowly but surely, the shock recedes until all we feel is the echo of the tragedy. One year on after Haji Daoud Nabi walked out of the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch and uttered the words “Welcome, brother” only to be met with bullets in response.“Al Noor” is an Arabic term which means “the light”. In the Qur’an, the term is used to describe the ine light of God. A light that a man filled with hatred tried to extinguish when he opened fire on dozens of innocent people in their place of worship on their holiest day of the week.The hurt that was expressed both on a community and global level wasn’t a pain that was uniquely or selectively Muslim. It was a universal and fundamentally human pain. It was the visceral pain of knowing that innocent people had been murdered. It was the outrage at the media outlets that humanised the terrorist by referring to him as an “angelic boy” and an “ordinary white man”.At the start of this month, I felt a sense of anxiety. I thought it was just me. In preparing to write this piece, I started reaching out to my Muslim friends to check in with them and ask how they were feeling with the one year anniversary of the tragedy fast approaching. The responses have been similar in many ways – united by a common thread of sadness, fear, frustration, and a deep sense that pain is still felt.What has followed is vicarious trauma. What this concept has meant for us, as inidual Muslims, and for our Muslim identities after the Christchurch massacre varies from inidual to inidual. For some Muslims it meant de-veiling. It meant standing with our backs to the wall on the train platform. It meant not setting foot in a mosque. It meant feeling a certain anxiety in public spaces – and for some it still does. However, it has also presented opportunities for us to lean on our communities for support, to express ourselves through art and poetry and to be unapologetically Muslim.We hold the Bankstown Poetry Slam on the last Tuesday of every month. Our event at the end of March 2019 was a space for community healing, support and love. The energy in the room was different. It was nervous, tense and sad. Mohammad Awad held back tears as he performed a poem dedicated to Mucad Ibrahim, the youngest victim of the massacre. “I keep seeing his smile … his cheekswill never grow laugh lines.” Ali Al Hajj implored us to understand that “hate speech” is not “free speech” but rather “comes at the cost of innocence”. Iman Etri asked rhetorically: “Don’t you know? He preyed on them in prayer but we make mosques of everywhere we go.” In many ways, spaces like this provide a platform for us to illuminate our struggles, our fears, our love, and our pain.For many of my Muslim friends, life has not changed. The stereotypes continue to be perpetuated. The fear of being attacked is palpable. The stares linger. In many ways, life has not changed because the world has not changed. However, hope exists. Hope is the opioid of the oppressed. As long as there is hope, the light of a future world that we can dream into existence looms on the horizon.Our Prophet Muhammad’s cousin, Imam Ali (peace be upon them both) is known for two quotes which I try to embody and live by.The first is to “be like the flower that gives fragrance, even to the hand that crushes it”.The second is that “every person is either your brother in faith or your equal in humanity”.If we all truly saw each other as equals, we can start to rebuild … with open mosque doors and open arms. With dignity, and with “noor”.• Sara Mansour is a lawyer, poet and the co-founder and director of the Bankstown Poetry Slam"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c280d6c1f34856fe9ef401f068cf352997ee5d0f/0_14_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b292fbadbb446b08a4087d906e152f50","title":"2020 mammal photographer of the year winners","story":"The winners of the Mammal Society’s annual photographic competition have been announced and the first prize has been claimed by amateur photographer Roger Cox from East London.

With romcoms, fantasy yarns and at least one disaster melodrama, here’s all you need to make the most of your time in front of the TVDigital deepfakery has progressed since this emerged in 1995, but there is a warm glow to be had from the adorable talking piglet who wants to do the work of a sheepdog.It melts in the mouth like a Waitrose pain au chocolat. Amélie is the innocently mischievous gamine who has whimsical fantasy adventures in Paris.As with others on this list, there is a debate about whether really great films deserve a “comfort” ranking, but Humphrey and Ingrid’s great romance in wartime Morocco soothes the soul.In troubled times, we all need a blast of supermodel Derek Zoolander’s compelling “blue steel” face. A film that never goes out of fashion.Perhaps this is cheating (you could as well put on something from your Downton Abbey TV DVD boxset) but a visit to the Crawley family’s leisured world will go down like a non-Christmas glass of sherry.The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly’s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents’ youth is always reassuring.Great performances from Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield and John Turturro in this true story of a rigged TV quiz show. A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying.Cinematic greatness is always comforting: wonderful songs and comedy in this fantastic New York musical with Vivian Blaine, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons.Director Rob Reiner makes the first of his two appearances on this list with this great romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s.Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Blythewood’s Love \u0026amp Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It’s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court.This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film’s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan – led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny.When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot.A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called “botanising on the asphalt”. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago’s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad’s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it.The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people’s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV – and realise that have feelings for each other.Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night.At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber’s shop – and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back.All together now: “By Grabthar’s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!” Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called Galaxy Quest and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes’ help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection.William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: “Nobody knows anything.” But we certainly know that this film is absolutely great: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own.This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she’s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh’s appalling flatmate Spike who says: “I’m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins”, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily.A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia’s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president – and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia’s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US’s quasi-colonialism in action?Nancy Meyers is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don’t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the orced woman with grown-up kids who is now a “chocolatier”, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way.Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time – and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives – and the way society somehow finds that a woman’s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage.Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep’s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway’s unwilling guide.There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: “We need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.” Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood – and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can’t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with Céline Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage – especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That’s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster – how it was going to be like Lew Grade’s Raise the Titanic what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc – but the film’s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34f584b4e46fd5b4d891aa8b183996d25fff3c07/0_0_6250_3750/master/6250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87a0458871eee20462c59d43a380e579","title":"larder living 10 best store cupboard recipes","story":"If coronavirus forces you to self-isolate, you’ll need to make the most of what you already have in your kitchen. Here’s how to spice things upSleepless parents, hard-partying students and anyone who works antisocial hours or is on a tight budget will know that a well-stocked kitchen cupboard is your best friend and that if you look after it, it will look after you. Now, however, the rest of us are getting a reminder, as the coronavirus outbreak forces thousands of us into self-isolation. Here are some ideas for what to cook if you are forced to rely on what you already have, rather than popping to the shops for ingredients.Yotam Ottolenghi once pointed out that there are as many variations on pilaf as there are nations in south and west Asia, the Middle East, India, the Balkans and large swathes of Africa. He was focusing on rice cooked with broth and other ingredients, but the cookbook writer Vicky Boghal has an even simpler go-to using cooked rice. Sautee it briskly with whatever you have to hand: finely chopped veg (fresh or from a can), sliced leftovers, tinned fish or cured meat and a drizzle of oil. To flavour, add your favourite condiment (soy sauce, Marmite, fish sauce, ketchup), spices (cumin, coriander), pickles (capers, jalapenos), dried fruit or herbs (dried parsley, thyme, rosemary) and a splash of water, and cover to steam for 10 minutes. Finish with seeds (I like sesame), fresh herbs if you have any or chopped nuts. Just to prove how eminently adaptable this dish is, Nigel Slater makes a bacon and mushroom version with bulgur wheat in place of rice: even the grain can be replaced ...Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing have perfected cooking from basics. Their pizza base mixes 160g self-raising flour with 150g Greek yoghurt, some salt and some cumin. But the Awesome Green’s vegan version will do just as well – 230g whole wheat flour mixed with 125 ml water, 1 tbsp oil, salt and nigella or some other kind of seed. Knead into a dough, then halve and roll out to the size of an oven-proof frying pan (or else transfer once fried to a baking sheet). Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas mark 7, and heat your frying pan on a high heat. Once hot, add a tiny splash of oil and carefully place the rolled-out dough in it. Fry on both sides for about five minutes, then top with whatever you have on your shelves. Pesto, tomato paste, even ketchup will work olives, capers, tinned peppers or aubergine any grated cheese, any cured meat. Transfer to the oven and bake for five to 10 minutes.The writer and campaigner Jack Monroe is, of course, the undisputed queen of cooking with canned goods, and not out of affectation. Her resourcefulness is exemplary, as demonstrated in this bootstrap chilli (to serve four), adapted from a Gordon Ramsay beef dish. Drain and rinse two cans of beans (Monroe uses red kidney and baked beans – you could try any others, or cook your own from scratch. The website Serious Eats says you can cook 130g of dry beans in place of a standard 400g tin). Cover with water and boil for 10 minutes, then simmer until soft. In a pan, fry some chopped onion in oil with cumin and paprika (hot sauce and dried or fresh chilli would work, too). Add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a stock cube and a splash of red wine. Add the drained beans and some dark chocolate and stir to combine. Serve with rice, or cold in a burrito, and any add-ons you have lying around: more hot sauce or salsa, jalapenos, sour cream or Greek yoghurt, fresh green leaves, grated cheddar …Author Emily Han has made this with every kind of bread. Arrange torn pieces of bread in a buttered baking dish and sprinkle with your choice of dried fruit (candied ginger, golden raisins, dates, you name it) and nuts. Pour over a mixture of one can of coconut milk (or other plant milk), three eggs (3 tbsp flax or chia seeds mixed with 9 tbsp water are a handy vegan substitute), sugar (Han’s recipe says 200g, which is a lot replace with honey, maple syrup, jam or date syrup to the quantity you are comfortable with), sweet spice (cardamom goes wonderfully with pistachios), vanilla if you like it and a pinch of salt. Bake at 170C (150C fan)325Fgas mark 3 for 45 minutes.Dried noodles are the perfect quick fix, as Fuchsia Dunlop puts it. All you need is something to make a sauce (oil, salt and heat), and something crunchy to put on top. She has an excellently simplified version of a Sichuan sauce (to serve four) mixing 4 tbsp peanut butter (in place of sesame you could easily substitute with tahini or another nut butter) with 2 ½ tbsp soy sauce and a dash of vinegar (she uses Chinkiang, but says red wine vinegar works fine, too). She mixes in oil (chilli and sesame olive would work just as well, with chilli flakes, chopped fresh chilli or a dash of hot sauce) and minced garlic, and whisks with enough stock or water to get the consistency of single cream. Cook four servings of noodles to packet instructions, then drain and ide between four bowls, top with the sauce, chopped chives or spring onions if you have any and a sprinkling of sesame seeds or chopped cashews. Tinned fish would add bulk, as would any finely sliced salad vegetables (cucumber, tomato, celery, lettuce).Slater does an excellent pumpkin dish that could work just as well with butternut squash or sweet potato. Fry 800g of chopped squash with some oil until golden brown. Remove then fry a chopped onion until brown, stir in some tomato puree, add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a canful of water and season with the spice or dried herb of your choice (he uses oregano thyme, parsley, rosemary or fennel would be lovely, too, as would cumin, coriander etc) and salt and pepper. Return the squash to the pan and simmer until soft – about 25 minutes. Serve with some kind of grain (bread, pasta, rice) and top with what you like: a dollop of something creamy, hot sauce or chilli flakes, fresh herbs, green leaves, a squeeze of lemon …One of the most adaptable things around : you need a base (cooked potato or sweet potato, mashed carrots or beans, tofu), bulk (cooked grains, more veg, chopped nuts, breadcrumbs) and flavour (spices, cheese, herbs, onion, garlic, lemon zest, seeds). Mix to obtain something that holds together nicely, then shape into balls and flatten before refrigerating for one hour. Heat some oil in a pan and fry for three to four minutes on both sides. Serve as you would a burger pattie.Meera Sodha’s vegan take on the sticky Swedish kladdkaka is mouthwatering. Being vegan, it uses dry goods and longlife or make-your-own milk substitutes: to 160ml heated olive oil you add 100g dark vegan chocolate to melt. Then mix in 200g plain flour, 200g caster sugar, 60g cocoa powder, some salt, some vanilla extract, 175ml almond milk and some fruit. Sodha uses the pulp of three passion fruit, which is about 3 tbsp I would try with the same amount of mashed banana, orange juice, yoghurt or nut butter – or just omit it entirely and see what happens kladdkaka is famous for being forgiving. Mix until smooth then pour into a lined cake tin and bake for 25 minutes at 200C (180C fan)400Fgas mark 6 or until a knife comes out clean.Ottolenghi makes this from scratch, cooking dried chickpeas with some cinnamon and dried chilli. You could just as easily make it with drained canned chickpeas, and add the spice with the other ingredients: garlic, cumin and coriander seeds, tomato paste, harissa (or other chilli paste), some olive oil and season with salt and pepper and some water. Bring to the boil then simmer until the chickpeas are as soft as you would like – add water as necessary. Before serving, add some lemon juice (fresh or bottled vinegar works too). Serve with poached eggs (I would just as soon add feta or some other fresh cheese, if I had any), bread to dip and extra harissa and olive oil.It is worth remembering how you can make a good spag bol without any meat. Anna Jones adds canned puy lentils to a tomato sauce made with onion, garlic, celery, carrot and one tin each of chopped tomatoes and tomato soup. To which, as she says, you could add pretty much any veg you find in your fridge. Serve with grated parmesan, fried breadcrumbs or fresh herbs.• This article was amended on 12 March 2020. The Jack Monroe recipe for chilli calls for dark chocolate, but not specifically “dark vegan chocolate” as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45705522135789c09ff33454e874467cf763cbe5/0_258_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b13fd259b4472ffede22db5fe8d48293","title":"michel roux made british food what it is today","story":"The renowned Michelin-starred chef pays tribute to the French restaurateur who has died aged 78 He had a fantastic sense of humour and could entertain a room full of people singlehandedly. He told jokes and made people laugh, but what I learned most from working with Michel was respect for our diners. The customer was king.Food changes with time but British food back then was stuck in the past. It was rubbish. Restaurants would just serve avocado with mayonnaise and sausage rolls, with half a grapefruit and cherry confit on top for dessert. It was a joke.If you were lucky, the best restaurants would have smoked salmon, but everything was overcooked.You can now eat as well in Britain as in any country in the world thanks to people like Michel. Particularly in London now, the choice is vast. He helped make the food what it is today.The beauty with Michel and Albert was that they gave young chefs the opportunity to become head chefs. They gave us responsibility and we took it. I worked as a sous chef at Le Gavroche and soon after, I was head chef at the Waterside Inn when it opened in 1972.He was like a father figure to me, even though he was only eight years older than me. Michel would keep an eye on what I was doing, but gave me a lot of freedom. The menu was almost all mine, and all of us working for him had lots of opportunities to step upwards.We had the same type of love for food and always remained friends. He loved life and would enjoy French red wines like bordeaux, chateau and burgundy, and his favourite dish was veal blanquette.The last time we had a meal together with a few friends, he suddenly started dancing.

The disease is causing more and more sport to be suspended so when Manchester United will hope to seal passage to the quarter-finals is unclear.Here, though, Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side did what was needed, turning in a professional performance, cruising to victory before the smattering of Lask fans allowed entry. Their side did pose an occasional threat despite operating on a budget roughly similar to a League Two team.Victory also takes United to 11 matches unbeaten, equalling their best run under the Norwegian, the previous streak coming at the start of his incumbency. Solskjær chose Odion Ighalo to replace the injured Anthony Martial and the Nigerian repaid the manager with a fine opener. This was his fourth goal in eight United appearances and the manager suggested his loan move may be made permanent.“Odion has done really well – we need those qualities for next season so let’s see,” said Solskjær, who went on to suggest the unsettled Paul Pogba, absent here, could also remain at the club beyond the summer. “Paul is our player and has got two years left on his contract – a year and the option of another year, so you can expect Paul to be here, yes.”Bruno Fernandes again led the way, trotting forward with the ball during the early exchanges and teeing up Fred, though the Brazilian blazed over. Next he won a free-kick with a slick flick-and-pirouette around an opponent. It yielded nothing and when Lask moved forward the visitors were turned for the first time.Klauss sprinted in behind Harry Maguire along the right and went down but Artur Dias, the referee, ignored the penalty shouts. Despite this, United were in control. A quick move that featured Brandon Williams to Ighalo down the right had the latter’s cross mis-hit by Juan Mata. Fernandes collected and fed Luke Shaw and when he put the ball in this time Mata drew a corner. Fernandes took it but Scott McTominay could not score with his header.United were warming up. The faster passing play that Fernandes has ignited since his winter transfer was behind a Daniel James snapshot that the goalkeeper, Alexander Schlager, saved well to his left. When Ighalo was signed on loan in January there was derision in some quarters. These naysayers had already been silenced by his three goals but the fourth suggested his arrival may prove a minor masterstroke: the ball arrived on the edge of the area at pace but following a mesmerising juggle he hammered the ball in off the bar to leave Schlager with no chance.“He had three touches and the fourth was the finish,” his manager said. “All those touches were high-quality, but he had to make them to give himself the space and the strike is on the half volley, great timing. No one would have saved that one.”While two over-enthusiastic United fans were ejected after breaking into the stadium, the home support nearly had an equaliser to cheer when the ball broke to Dominik Frieser near Sergio Romero’s goal. The forward’s attempt looked to be heading in before Eric Bailly blocked.The half closed with United still in the ascendancy. Another pinpoint Fernandes corner deserved a better header from Maguire. But Solskjær’s half-time chat seemed simple: telling his side to sharpen up in front of goal to make the contest comfortable.First up was a Lask free-kick, though, after Shaw was booked for felling Dominik Reiter. Peter Michorl took it but United’s wall did its job. Valérien Ismaël’s team pressed, but United were able to roll the ball around until Shaw was in position down the left. He hit Mata but the No 8’s first-time effort sailed over.A dimension Ighalo offers is the outlet ball and how he killed a high pass and twisted before spraying possession wide to Williams was a fine illustration. Next he turned creator, helping James to break a six-month drought by finding the Welshman, the latter’s long-range strike his fourth of the season. Moments later, Ighalo might have scored again but hit the right-hand post, Fernandes’s vision again releasing the striker.In the closing stages United added three more. With eight minutes left Mata finished clinically after Fred played him in with a glorious through-ball. In added time Tahith Chong put in Mason Greenwood, who smashed in via both posts, and there was still time for a fifth as Andreas Pereira’s speculative long-range effort was fluffed in by Schlager to complete a satisfying night in Austria’s third city.What happens next for United in the Europa League is unclear. This may be their last action for a while."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102728023050216f0a86ab40b92ddff6037c1908/20_34_2519_1512/master/2519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=468b6abde58ad7603256e3c437213bfb","title":"premier league plays on as normal while other top leagues cancel","story":"Premier League clubs are preparing for the football season to be suspended after the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday night and their match on Saturday against Brighton was postponed.Arsenal confirmed their first team squad and coaches would now self-isolate, and they would be unable to play some fixtures on the scheduled dates. In the early hours of Friday, Chelsea announced their players are self-isolating after Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive.Meanwhile, having earlier declared that the weekend’s top-flight games would go ahead as planned, the Premier League has called an emergency meeting with its clubs on Friday regarding future fixtures this season.One club executive told the  they expected the season to be suspended for several weeks in the light of the Arteta news, and didn’t rule out the possibility of the whole season being voided.On Thursday it was also reported that the Manchester City defender, Benjamin Mendy, is self-isolating after a member of his family fell ill, and three Leicester players have also undergone tests for Covid-19 after experiencing symptoms.As things stand, the Premier League is the only major top-flight league in Europe not to shut down or close its doors because of the coronavirus. The top isions in Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United States have all been suspended amid the outbreak, while the German Bundesliga and France’s Ligue 1 are holding matches behind closed doors.Fixtures in the Scottish Premiership also appear set to be postponed after this weekend’s Old Firm clash between Rangers and Celtic, following First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s announcement that gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned from Monday.Earlier, English football had been told to carry on as normal after the government’s medical experts insisted that their remained a very low probability of someone with Covid-19 infecting a large number of people in a stadium. However, the Arteta news quickly made that advice appear complacent.The scale of the problem for global sport due to the rapid spread of the virus was once again illustrated in a fast-moving 24 hours as:• European football’s governing body, Uefa, moved closer towards postponing the 2020 European Championships, the final of which is due to be held at Wembley, until 2021. Uefa officials will discuss the future of the tournament next week.• Real Madrid’s Champions League match against Manchester City next Tuesday was delayed after a basketball player from the Madrid team, which shares the same training facility, tested positive for the virus.• This weekend’s Formula One season-opening Australian GP in Melbourne was called off after a staff member from the McLaren team tested positive for Covid-19.• President Trump called for the Tokyo Olympic Games in July to be postponed for a year.• Men’s tennis was shut down for six weeks, with the prestigious Miami Open and Monte Carlo tournaments cancelled.• The Pro-14 rugby tournament for clubs from Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Italy and South Africa was suspended until further notice.• Irish racing was told that it must be held behind closed doors until 27 March.• In the US, major league basketball, baseball, hockey and soccer were all suspended, with the NCAA’s March Madness basketball tournaments cancelled.This summer’s European Championships were already expected to be the most complicated ever staged, because 12 stadiums in 12 different countries were being used, starting in Rome on 12 June and ending on 12 July with the final at Wembley. But the spread of the coronavirus has now put its future in doubt. Delaying Euro 2020 could free up space in the calendar for the European leagues to finish their seasons this summer.The Euro 2021 women’s tournament in England is not due to start until 11 July, so one plan being discussed is for the men’s competition to take place beforehand. A final decision will come when Uefa meets with representatives from the clubs, leagues and the players’ union Fifpro on Tuesday.Insiders have also told the  that “everything will be on the table” at the meeting – including drastic plans to make the rest of this season’s Champions League and Europa League ties into one-legged games staged in neutral venues.Uefa confirmed the talks were “in the light of the ongoing developments in the spread of Covid-19 across Europe and the changing analysis of the World Health Organisation.”The International Olympic Committee has insisted that it is still full steam ahead for the Olympics in Japan in July despite calls from Trump for a postponement until 2021.At a briefing at the White House, Trump said: “I like that better than I like having empty stadiums all over the place,” he said. “If you cancel it, do it a year later. That’s a better alternative rather than having it with no crowd.”But the IOC said it remained “absolutely in line with our Japanese hosts” in its commitment to deliver a safe Olympic Games this year.In the cricket, England’s tour of Sri Lanka was continuing. But a spokesperson for the ECB said “this is a highly evolving situation and circumstances are changing rapidly, sometimes several times a day”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3759c7100596f9ebc5d6eea60c587dfea946448d/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d182bebebb41a7a6eb64e97c6aa5a1d6","title":"premier league and british football set for shutdown due to coronavirus live","story":"The EFL have confirmed an emergency meeting will take place this morning “to make a decision on this weekend’s fixtures and beyond”. It seems inevitable that football will shutdown on these shores, belatedly following in the footsteps of many European leagues. There will be no action in La Liga for “at least the next two rounds of matches” as a result of the quarantine of the Real Madrid squad, while the Netherlands’ top two leagues have also been suspended for the same period. The EFL board and Premier League are both meeting this morning, hours after stating this weekend’s action would go ahead as planned.Callum Hudson-Odoi says he is feeling fine and has recovered from coronavirus, but is self isolating, as per government advice. “As you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days, which I’ve recovered from. I’m following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. I hope to see everybody soon and hopefully be back on the pitch very soon.”It probably shouldn’t have taken a top-flight manager to contract coronavirus to prompt action, but that seems to be where we are at, with an emergency meeting planned between Premier League powers on Friday morning to determine the next step after news of Mikel Arteta’s positive result. A few hours ago, Chelsea also announced their players are self-isolating after Callum Hudson-Odoi returned a positive test for the virus, while three Leicester players have also undergone tests for Covid-19 after experiencing symptoms. The outcome of that meeting, and the subsequent domino effect across the Football League and beyond, will inevitably dominate the discourse, but we will keep an eye on everything else too, though the football itself is trivial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c60756f8a212fe62e348f224a5e1f92a9949a23/102_167_5402_3242/master/5402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d805045233fb4d0e98716f880d371f32","title":"dance south africans graduate high school","story":"Many South African youths fail to graduate from high school. For the few who do, the ‘Matric’ celebrations are prodigiousIn the Cape Flats, the townships and countryside in and around Cape Town, most students drop out of high school due to pregnancy, substance abuse or being recruited by gangs. Many have to leave school to support their families. School fees are a steep price to pay in an area where most families struggle to put food on the table.Matric dances are held to celebrate those who graduate (matriculate). For months beforehand, families who live in poverty-stricken areas save to buy extravagant ballgowns and tuxedos, and to hire limousines for the big night. If a family is lucky enough to have a student graduate from high school, no effort is spared to give them the night of their dreams. For many, this is the first family member to graduate.On the night of the dance, the communities on the outskirts of Cape Town are buzzing with activity. Red carpets are rolled out while aunts decorate houses with organza fabric, and tables are heavily laden with food for family and friends. The streets outside are full and excited children run around. The sound of a sports car echoes down the street as it approaches the crowded house.A young woman wearing a ballgown steps onto the red carpet, and the community cheers with pride.The youth need young role models to inspire them. If you see other young people succeeding it inspires you and you can relate to that. It sets a tone. The future is ours for the taking. I hope to be a positive role model in my community.I decided that a baby wasn’t going to stand in my way of finishing school. I needed to do this to give her a better life. My mom helped me so much through all of this.It was challenging losing both my parents, and living with family can be hard. My grandmother has a big family so there isn’t a lot of space and sometimes it can be noisy and disruptive to study. Moving around has been ungrounding, but I have learned that if you want something, you have to work hard and just go for it!The youth need to find inspiration and aspiration. Most people in my community don’t aspire to anything more than what they see every day.A lot of kids in my community don’t finish high school. The words of my mother motivated me to finish school and so I decided that it was something I wanted to do for myself.I am excited to be finishing school, but I will also miss it. High school made me the person I am today. The sad thing is that sometimes kids who have a lot of potential and who actually want to finish high school have to drop out to work so that they can help support their families.This is just the start for me.No matter what your circumstances or how poor you are, don’t ever give up. That matric certificate is a key that can open any door. Don’t let finances get in the way of following your dreams. I’m not letting it stop me. Keep working hard – it pays off in the end!I believe that hard work and determination will determine your future. And passion. If you don’t have passion for what you do, you will easily be distracted. When you enjoy doing something, you feel the need to do it.In these times you can’t blame your circumstances for where you end up in life. I want to rise up and prove that I can make something of my life.I see how the kids around me drop out of school and fall victim to drug abuse and gangsterism. I want something better for my life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41efc936e87bacfc693e13a559918a07b9e47b2a/0_92_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a7e030c965da6125bd278a6a6eafb32","title":"no school no skating the indian skate park bringing children together","story":"Bringing skateboards to children in Madhya Pradesh gives them enthusiasm to go to school and gives girls a confidence in themselvesThe children skid into the dusty courtyard at breakfast time, grabbing skateboards from a stack near a tethered brown cow.Boards jammed under arms, they sprint barefoot past a large well pump, the main water supply for many families here. They slap their wheels on to the still-clean concrete of Janwaar Castle – India’s newest skateboard park.Opened in January to replace a skateboard park built a few hundred metres away in 2015, the large structure is flanked by grain crops that lie on the edge of Janwaar, a village of roughly 150 households in rural Madhya Pradesh, one of India’s poorest states.Soon, about 50 children are skating on the concrete. Toddlers scoot on boards, laying on their stomachs, while older children egg each other on to perform elaborate tricks. However, when a bell rings from the schoolhouse next to the park, boards are dropped and the children file inside, illustrating the real purpose of the park.Ulrike Reinhard, the founder of Janwaar Castle and Rural Changemakers, the German NGO that funds it, set two rules for the young skaters: “No school, no skating” and “girls first”. The result has been increased school attendance and a chance to challenge prejudices.Many parents in the village, where family earnings can dip below 2,500 rupees (£27) a month, received little or no education themselves, so don’t put pressure on their children to attend school.Arun Kumar, 18, says that by the time his mother was 11 she was a married housewife. When he should have been in school, he says: “I just played and ran around the village.”Asha Gond, 20, a director of Barefoot Skateboarders, an offshoot of Rural Changemakers that runs Janwaar Castle, says: “Before the skateboard park, kids just weren’t going to school.” About 80 children are now enrolled in the village’s primary school since the park was opened, average pupil attendance rose from about 25 to 50.As well as overseeing the park, Gond runs supplementary lessons for the children, outside the schoolhouse, using rocks as counting aids.She regularly travels to New Delhi for training on a scholarship from NGO, and hopes to teach full-time in the village soon. There are still complaints about current teaching standards, which is why there is a need for her extra classes.Popular, brilliant at skating, and with an ability to handle children with quiet authority, Gond has become a role model for the Janwaar children. In a male-dominated community, that is significant.Along with the “girls first” rule, Gond’s role as a director helped reorder gender hierarchy among the children. Reinhard says that, without the rule, boys would have dominated the park. Instead, when a girl asks for a skateboard it is shared without protest. The result is visible: often there are as many girls skating as boys.Gond says that, without discovering her skating talent, she would probably have become a housewife in an arranged marriage. When she first started skating in 2016, pressure to marry dovetailed with village gossip.“Village people were saying things to my parents,” Gond says. “Like: ‘I’m skateboarding with boys, I’m talking to boys.’ So my father said: ‘Stop skateboarding.’ I was thinking: ‘Why can’t I do what I want?’ Boys do anything they want. Every day I was crying, but after crying I would feel stronger and new thoughts would come.”When Gond started winning medals in skateboarding competitions, her parents eased off. Seeing tangible results from her obsession – she also skateboarded in a TV advert for tyres – they began to accept that she didn’t want an arranged marriage.The building of Janwaar Castle was not without controversy. According to Reinhard, its construction ruffled feathers among some members of the Yadav caste, a group traditionally considered to be of higher social status than the village’s other group, Aasi. A row over land use led to the second park being built, and the first largely abandoned.Beyond gender and caste, the park’s existence arguably created a further ide: between skaters and non-skaters. As school ends and children get back on boards, a young girl walks by the park with a bundle of wood balanced on her head. Some parents insist their children dedicate time to house work, rather than school or skateboarding.Despite this, the park appears to have been overwhelmingly positive for many children. And its impact has been noticed outside Madhya Pradesh. Reinhard says that other village communities, including some near Bangalore and in the eastern state Odisha, recently worked on their own skateboard parks after seeking advice from Janwaar.The sun sets, the children reluctantly trudge home from Janwaar Castle, and Gond’s mood becomes reflective. “Life is life – there is no meaning, you have to make your own purpose,” she says, kicking the end of her board so it leaps upwards. “Do what you want … don’t listen to what people say about you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48dfdc141529c60aa8c907e807f3553d3eb87029/94_316_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e4bfbe964022ac8fb17e9365468e9e","title":"remembering a fit of the giggles can make me lose it all over again","story":"As much as I love them, they have frequently got me into troubleWe get the giggles. We do not choose the giggles. The giggles choose us. It is entirely the giggles’ decision as to when they will join us, and when they will leave us. There is a reason, when I am roaring with laughter, that I say: “I’ve lost it.” (If I can get the words out.) There is a reason we refer to them as “fits” of giggles. It does not matter, the place, the time, the inconvenience – we are at their mercy. Our cheeks aching, shoulders shaking, tears streaming, nostrils bubbling.The giggles are a distillation of pure, exuberant, atavistic happiness and therefore one of the very best things in life. Some episodes are fleeting and do not linger in the memory. Others, when recalling the catalyst, will induce the same reaction for years, perhaps a lifetime. Muscle memory the particular muscles being those either side of one’s mouth.Giggles do not discriminate. As much as I love them, they have frequently got me into trouble, or caused deep discomfort. Sometimes inappropriateness only serves to exacerbate them. I broke out at my father’s funeral when my sister and I were struggling to get out of the car. Of course, the all-over-body laughter made me weaker and I then struggled even more with the door handle. Eventually we tumbled out, creasing up.I’m not sure I could count on one hand the number of times I have had to excuse myself from the ’s daily newsroom conference because something has tickled me so much and won’t stop. It is especially difficult to compose myself when catching the eye of the colleague (or colleagues) who caused the laugh attack.The only time I can remember when the giggles were a heart-stoppingly awful experience – it brings me terror just thinking about it – was when I was on stage at the Southbank Centre. Something, which I will not be sharing here, triggered me in front of 1,000 people, and I spent the next five minutes sweating, squirming furiously and rubbing my palm across my face in a desperate bid to calm myself down, while praying I would not be called upon to say anything. But now, in the comfort of my own home, I am thinking about what set me off.

But the truth could be far more sinisterI was a remarkably strange, earnest, rule-abiding 10-year-old, so when we received a prank call to the house once, I didn’t immediately realise it was happening. I don’t think it hit me that it was a prank until I was deep into my 20s. I assumed that the voice on the other end of the phone asking, “Is your washing machine running?” was a representative of Hotpoint making a legitimate follow-up survey call after a vaguely recent purchase. I had to walk all the way downstairs to find my mum, who it turns out was in the bathroom, to ask her. I knocked on the door.“Is the washing machine running?”“What? I can’t hear you.”“Who wants to know?”“Man on the phone.”“A man on the phone wants to know about our washing machine?”“Well tell him ‘Yes’ then!”Then I trudged all the way upstairs again, to someone who had set out two minutes ago to make a harmless prank call and was now frantically coining 20p pieces into a public phone box to hear how this saga ended, and picked up the phone. “She says yes,” I said, dutifully, and then, with the expectation of generations behind him, with a breath held for hours before him in anticipation, with the raw earthly power of the wind itself, he shouted: “WELL BEST GET RUNNING AFTER IT THEN!” and hung up. I was utterly, thoroughly owned.Solidarity, then, with the Artist Formerly Known As Prince Harry, who, it emerged this week, was allegedly the victim of a prank phone call from Russia’s Ant and Dec equivalent, Vovan and Lexus (Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov). Actually, I suspect they are possibly more like Russia’s JK \u0026amp Joel. Anyway, they somehow duped him into thinking he was on a conference call with Greta Thunberg and her father, Svante, twice over Christmas and New Year. The calls were released online this week and, honestly, they are … fine? They are less embarrassing than interrogating your mum about white goods, as a random example.Here a few selected excerpts. President Donald Trump has “blood on his hands” due to his continuing tubthumping of the US coal industry. Getting married into the royal family is “not all it’s made out to be”. Boris Johnson is a “good man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you”. On the Sussexes having a private jet habit: “Unfortunately, there are very few alternatives”. On Prince Andrew having a private jet habit: “I have very little to say on that. But whatever he has done or hasn’t done is completely separate from me and my wife.” He rounded the phone call out by saying: “I was in the military for 10 years, so I’m more normal than my family would like to believe.” Which I think is pushing it a bit. There are literally four career paths available to former members of the British army – bullish Apprentice contestant murderer hidden homeless ignored by the government and Nervous Man At Public Fireworks Display. Harry has about a week and a half to decide which of them he is going to take up.Read the headlines on Harry taking a phone call in good faith from a prominent climate activist and proceeding to have a mild conversation that was so watertight it could’ve run on The One Show as a “bit” and you would see it as an enormous “Gotcha!” That Harry – who dared to leave a royal family he was never going to be the king of simply because existence within its ancient structures is deeply horrible – was a spoilt brat who, seconds after announcing his exit, let the artifice slip and started blabbing family secrets to anyone who could reach his incredibly secure line at his safe house in Canada. Or you might see it as an agenda pushed by a media that got chided by the same man for aggressively pushing a witch-hunt against his wife: I don’t know. The cynic in me, though – the one born the second he put that phone down as a child, who in that moment learned never to believe anything again – thinks this is all an act.Think about it. Harry has left the royal family to a mixed response (you fall into one of two camps: you either think leaving an ancient institution on mental health and limelight-pressure grounds into a life of guaranteed wealth and family bliss is a good idea, or you Extremely Care About Whether The Taxpayer Still Funds His Security Detail). He needs a PR win. What better way to woo the young, hip, always-online crowd than by speaking their language, of YouTube pranks, diplomatic “see all sides” opinions about world leaders, sincere wife-guy expressions of love and all the right noises about the climate crisis? Being pranked by Russians was arguably the best thing he could have done for his career at this point.My only fear is that this will result in the remaining members of the royal family trying to get in on the “speaking the language of online” trend, in a bid to out-Harry Harry. William tries to do the Say So TikTok dance in front of an assembly full of year 6 children, or something. Kate Middleton does a lacklustre smoky-eye beauty tutorial. Prince Charles makes one of those vile Instagram cooking videos which consists of just his knobbly hands seen holding a tray of Duchy of Cornwall butter to melt it over an induction hob and then mixing it with ribboned hotdogs. Prince Andrew gets caught slowly licking his lips on Chaturbate. It’s a perilous new era for Britain’s favourite family. Let’s see where they go with it.Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have become the first A-list celebrities to test positive for coronavirus. You have to assume there are various Hollywood-adjacent WhatsApp groups currently seething about this news: it’s just so Tom Hanks of Tom Hanks to be the guy to get coronavirus, isn’t it? First he has an entire career of impeccable award-winning acting. Then he is universally embraced as the ultimate nice guy, like one of those footballers who somehow goes their whole career without a single yellow card. And now he gets to be the first big coronavirus scalp while filming an Elvis biopic in Australia. That is just … so Hanksian, isn’t it? He probably got it after too-close contact with an infected typewriter. Tom Hanks never stops being Tom Hanks, even for one second.All the more odd, then, that his son Chet announced the news with a topless Instagram video in which Chet appears huge, hulking and tattooed like the back of a dollar bill, the leg day-skipping gym receptionist who ghosts you to end all other leg day-skipping gym receptionists who ghost you. He leads with: “What’s up everyone, uh, yeah, uh, it’s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy.”If you are unfamiliar with Chet Hanks, I must urge you to swim deep down the rabbit hole of him over your next month of self-isolation: as a human being, he is fascinating as the direct descendant of the world’s nicest man, he is doubly so as an example of how mind-bending it must be to grow up the son of one of the planet’s most famous actors, he is a cautionary tale.He last made headlines for dropping a bizarrely competent patois accent at the Golden Globes (I won’t transcribe the whole thing, but “Big up, big up the whole island massive, it’s your boy Chet coming straight from the Golden Globes” features heavily). And now he is dropping Tom Hanks Health Updates in the form of Instagram thirst traps. I am obsessed. “I just got off the phone with them,” Chet concluded. “They both are fine, they’re not even that sick. They’re not worried about it, they’re not tripping, but they’re going through the necessary health precautions, obviously.” Guys, please don’t worry. Tom Hanks is not tripping. But if you are worried about him, please slide into Chet Hanks’s DMs, where you will be welcomed warmly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc5a6cd6597a985e3952865740e6a679ccbb64c0/0_0_2340_1753/master/2340.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=240f9f33cd1e052863740e950207c527 880w","title":"dumama kechou buffering juju review","story":" (Mushroom Hour Half Hour)A woman’s release from prison provides a folkloric story that drives the Johannesburg duo’s wonderfully inventive debutSouth Africa’s Mushroom Hour Half Hour label has been releasing some of the more ear-tickling sounds from the country’s experimental scene in recent years. There was 2019’s propulsive free-jazz ensemble debut Spaza, a series of beautiful folk-led guitar and vocal releases from Sibusile Xaba in 2017 and percussionist Thabang Tabane’s 2018 debut. Now offering up the label’s most narratively driven record is Johannesburg duo Dumama + Kechou.Loosely concerning the story of a woman released from prison and her shapeshifting attempts to connect with the landscape via spiritual entities, its impressionistic folkloric narrative is sung in layered harmonies by Gugulethu Duma (AKA Dumama) and backed by choppy electro-acoustic production from Algerian-German Kerim Melik Becker (Kechou).It’s a meandering listen, ranging from Duma’s crystalline choral harmonies on Leaving Prison and Mother Time, to the bent uhadi bow and garbled speech-in-tongues on For Madala. Yet Duma and Becker achieve a convincing synthesis, crafting electronic drum loops to layer beneath the Xhosa percussion and splicing modal keys between the harsh metallic plucking of strings. They are helped by a list of collaborators: pianist Nobuhle Ashanti and vocalist Odwa Bongo provide an undulating foundation in For Madala, while the synthesisers of keys player Dion Monti are a man-made, steely presence among the warm vocals and percussion throughout.The album highlight comes on Uveni, perhaps the most straightforward of the eight tracks, with its cyclical song structure creating the perfect improvisational space for free jazz clarinettist Angel Bat Dawid to spear her keening riffs. Ultimately it is the cumulative power of this multi-vocal expression that allows for a soundscape to build over the course of the album. The varied sounds of the record reflect Johannesburg’s constantly evolving musicality and the duo’s mixed heritages. This is their titular juju, their spiritual power.The first posthumous release from a giant of the trumpet, Hugh Masekela, featuring studio collaborations from his longtime friend Tony Allen. Pieced together from unfinished sessions in 2010, the resulting record, Rejoice, is a remarkably coherent blend of swing and Afrobeat, featuring some of Allen’s finest work behind the kit to date and Masekela’s inimitable horn melodies shining on numbers such as Agbada Bougou. The 80s synth experimenter Raviv Gazit reissues his overlooked 1985 LP Ze, a subtly challenging and meditatively pensive set of Synclavier works. All-female ensemble Divahn  put their spin on a pan-Middle Eastern music with Shalhevet, featuring tender reimaginings of Sephardi songs and incorporating the powerful, ululating vocals of Galeet Dardashti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92130378a072b98604a21abe745dc8691a4b7e23/708_142_2417_1451/master/2417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9b774aada8db63ae223d733d36aae60","title":"uk and eu agree to dial down rhetoric in brexit talks","story":"Both sides expected to produce legal texts of negotiating positions next weekThe UK and the EU have agreed to “dial down the rhetoric” over Brexit in an effort to open up space for a deal, it has emerged.Brussels and London are expected to produce legal texts of their negotiating positions next week, with diplomatic sources claiming both sides have agreed to “lower the temperature” to enable the texts to be considered in detail to assess the scale of the ergence.“The moment you see the legal texts, that’s when you see how good or bad things really are,” one insider said.Next week’s Brexit talks in London have been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak, but in a joint statement both sides said they were looking at alternative options, such as teleconferencing.“Given the latest Covid-19 developments, UK and EU negotiators have today jointly decided not to hold next week’s round of negotiations in London, in the form originally scheduled,” a joint UK and EU statement said on Thursday.“Both sides are currently exploring alternative ways to continue discussions, including if possible the use of video conferences.” While the coronavirus outbreak has pushed Brexit out of the spotlight, negotiators are concerned that behind-the-scenes efforts must continue if they are to seal the outline of a deal before June.Four areas, including fisheries and crime and justice, have already been identified as the areas of deepest conflict – with little hope of progress in the second round of talks.On Northern Ireland, the EU has made it clear the onus is on the UK to come up with a plan to implement the controversial special arrangements, which include a trade barrier down the Irish Sea. The expectation is that the UK will come to the inaugural meeting of the EU-UK joint committee meeting on 30 March with its first such proposals.“The ball is now in the UK court,” one source said. “It is up to the UK to tell us how they are going to implement this.”While there has been a notable de-escalation in the war of words, there is concern about the fundamental clash in approaches to Brexit the UK defining it as a battle of sovereignty and the EU prioritising the economic case for close relations.Fisheries is seen as a clear case in point, with the UK arguing the case for control over its waters, and the EU arguing for an economic partnership in which both sides will continue to fish in British waters. Both sides are expecting a major battle over fisheries, one of the least economically important areas of trade but the one that “wins or loses elections”.With the UK vowing not to extend the transition period beyond 31 December, negotiations experts say a row will inevitably be deployed as a tactic, possibly by both sides.“You have limited time, you are in the worst possible scenario as a rule-taker and money-giver, so extending the transition period is not politically sustainable. So what do you do to achieve a deal? You dramatise it enough to create the tension to force a deal,” one source said.It has also become increasingly apparent in Brussels that London is not going to shift its position on Brexit as primarily an issue of sovereignty, rather than economics, causing problems in areas where agreement could easily be reached.On Wednesday, Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told MPs there would not be an agreement on Reach, the EU body of rules that govern chemicals.Speaking as one of the most powerful government ministers in relation to Brexit, Gove indicated the government was not objecting to ergence on the Reach rules, telling MPs “one of the problems is that it involves the European court of justice”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81e16b68461f1e98adc7880126a9c42005a4ad8/0_77_1763_1058/master/1763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cecdf049df7dbdade931d4f774c89358","title":"seven alternatives to skiing on your winter holiday","story":"Never mind the après-ski pros, even true powder hunters need a break from the slopes every now and then. Here are seven great options for going off pisteWhen you head off for your winter mountain break, it’s likely that either skiing or snowboarding is the main thing on your mind. However, most ski resorts offer a wealth of other activities that you can enjoy on bad weather days, in the evenings, or simply because you fancy a change from whizzing down the mountain.“More and more people are coming to us who want to do more than just skiing,” says Gilles Meyer, chef de village (resort manager) at Club Med Les Arcs Panorama resort in the French Alps. “It’s been a real trend over the past five years. They come to ski, but they also want to enjoy moments and experiences that aren’t skiing.”So if you’re looking to give the slopes the slip for an afternoon, here are seven alternative activities to try.Dog sleddingMeet the musher and their huskies or Alaskan malamutes and enjoy an exhilarating ride through a beautiful landscape pulled by these highly-trained and lovable dogs. “It’s a nice experience for the whole family. It’s a very green activity and suitable for everyone – you can even take your baby,” says Meyer.Snow mountain bikingRiding a “fat bike”, with extra-wide tyres to help keep your grip on the snow, means mountain biking is no longer strictly a summer activity. Suitable for just about anyone who can ride a bike, some resorts also offer snow mountain e-biking to make going uphill just as easy as coming down.Go to a yoga classYoga can help with your strength, balance and confidence on the slopes and is both an excellent way to prepare for the day ahead, as well as wind down at the end of it. Many Club Med resorts offer yoga classes several times a day as part of their all-inclusive package.Go to the spaThe mountains are the perfect place to enjoy a spa experience, whether you’ve been out on the slopes and want to ease your aching muscles, or are simply looking to relax. Some have hot tubs or heated pools, where you can comfortably be outside in the water even as the snow falls. “People love to have a body treatment after skiing. We have 13 spa treatment cabins here in Les Arcs,” Meyer says.Ice skatingMost resorts have an outdoor rink, and some have an indoor one too, making skating an excellent all-weather activity. Skates are available for hire, and many venues offer portable supports to make it easier for even small children to have a go. Some resorts also offer lessons if you or your children want to have a go at figure skating, and in some places you can even skate on a natural lake or pond.Enjoy a wine tasting sessionMany areas with good skiing also produce interesting wine. Even if they don’t, some restaurants and bars offer sessions for people who want to learn more about wine, led by a sommelier. At Club Med, the wine-tasting sessions are led by a sommelier in a dedicated area of the cosy gourmet lounges. Sessions throughout the week focus on local wines, French wines and wines from around the world.Nordic walking and snowshoeingEven if you don’t want to ski or snowboard, there are still plenty of ways to get out on the mountain and enjoy the scenery. For Nordic walking, all you need is some decent walking boots and some special walking poles – it’s a great way to keep fit and get out in the fresh air. Snowshoeing is usually a slower-paced option. “Snowshoeing is for people who want to be outside in nature, seeing the animals, to walk and to relax. You can be in the powder and it’s nice and easy for everyone,” says Meyer.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11bd665a31defa5e598c7a6e044e15e402a20d57/37_0_5861_3517/master/5861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ba5da5b3f6ed0eb85a5cba10f501963","title":"sawgrass closes doors to spectators and masters may have to follow suit","story":"The PGA Tour has decided to scrap the rest of the Players Championship, and shut down its other tournaments for the next three weeks, over coronavirus fears. The growing crisis has left golfers concerned the Masters will be played behind closed doors, or called off altogether.The potential for a Masters free from spectators dominated discussion during the first round of the Players Championship, after the PGA Tour imposed a closed-door policy for the final 54 holes at Sawgrass. The PGA later announced that the Sawgrass event has been cancelled.Jay Monahan, the Tour’s commissioner, revealed he held discussions with President Trump before announcing the initial ban on spectators. Attention has now turned towards the first major of the year – due to tee off on 9 April – with an update expected from Augusta National imminently.“It would be very unusual without hearing the roars echoing through the valley,” said Jordan Spieth, the 2015 Masters champion, of an empty Augusta. “You can feed off a crowd anywhere and it can also a add a bit of pressure as well, in certain situations. This isn’t ideal for anyone but I think if you polled the players we would rather have the Masters go on without spectators than not go on at all. I think you would probably get a unanimous vote on that one. But it’s a shame.”The Tour’s initial stance was criticised by the Englishman Lee Westwood. “Considering the approach of other sports in the US, I’m surprised how little the PGA Tour are doing,” the former world No 1 said. “I know we don’t play in such a confined arena but surely our age-range of fans are more susceptible.”The Taiwanese player CT Pan withdrew from the Players hours before the first round while aiming a broadside at the lack of coronavirus safeguards at the course. “I’m probably the only one who is not playing,” Pan posted on Twitter. “Same number as the hand sanitizers in the clubhouse, locker and dining.”Monahan had sought to emphasise differences between golf and other US-based sports – the NBA being the prime example and which has suspended competition completely. “Obviously we’re an outdoor sport, we’re not in a stadium, and here this week at Sawgrass our players are making their way over 400 acres,” he said. “We felt by taking this step to address the problem with our fans, we’re in a position where we can continue to operate the events as of right now.”Monahan admitted there would be a “significant” financial hit from his Tour’s flagship competition going spectator-free. About 200,000 tickets have been sold for the week.Hideki Matsuyama ignored the fraught backdrop to return a nine-under 63 on Thursday, matching the course record at Sawgrass before the tournament was abandoned. Rory McIlroy, who opened with a 72, said of the Masters: “I don’t see how they can let spectators in if they do play it at this point.” On the broader picture, the world No 1 said: “Everyone needs to get tested.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06fc7f445267f90c7867b415ce930b57c48584de/0_224_5138_3083/master/5138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c943721aa22035fd718a176f89384f1","title":"australian grand prix formula one mismanagement coronavirus","story":"With Covid-19 curtailing activity globally, that F1 felt it could escape unscathed seems hopelessly naiveFor a sport proud of presenting its drama on a global stage Formula One’s curtain raiser in Melbourne offered only farce. With the Australian Grand Prix cancelled because of the coronavirus, events that have seemed all too predictable were portrayed as having accelerated beyond expectations. The governing bodies left wringing their hands, protesting impotence as the wheels came off and with the opening meetings of the new season also most likely condemned to cancellation. The global drama brought low by the global pandemic.On Friday morning at Albert Park, F1, the sport’s governing body the FIA and race organisers the Australian Grand Prix Corporation announced the race was to be abandoned. It had been almost 12 hours since McLaren announced that one of its team members had tested positive for the coronavirus.The decision making process, involving all the governing bodies, teams and government health officials had been long and torturous, but not communicated externally and not announced until fans were already queuing to get into the circuit in their droves. It was merely mismanagement that had crowned what increasingly appears to have been at best an optimistic decision to bring thousands of F1 personnel from a Europe already creaking under the assault of the coronavirus to a mass gathering event that attracts up to 100,000 people a day. In the light of sport across the world curtailing activity to restrict the spread of the virus, that F1 felt it could escape unscathed seems hopelessly naive.At Albert Park on Friday under suitably overcast, gloaming skies, the big screens dotted around the track incongruously still glared their bright, digital greetings, welcoming one and all to the Melbourne GP. Their audience mere desultory, dusty expanses of empty space. Their bright entreaties now hollow, baleful, monuments to the hubris that had surely fuelled this failure.At a hastily assembled press conference held outdoors at the track, F1’s chief executive Chase Carey did his best to put his company’s case for coming so far and in doing so taking the risks of further spreading the virus ultimately for nothing.“It is obviously a fluid situation,” he said. “The situation today is different than it was two days ago, which was different than it was four days ago, so trying to look out and make those sorts of predictions when it’s changing this quick is challenging.”On Thursday it was the positive test result that precipitated the collapse of the house of cards. It led McLaren to withdraw from the race and other teams including, it is understood, Ferrari and later Mercedes, insisting they too would not take part. That someone in the paddock might be infected was surely inescapable. Shortly beforehand Lewis Hamilton, the six-time world champion whose position at the very apex of the sport lends his words both freedom and weight, had dismissed the decision to come to Australia witheringly as “cash is king”.Certainly F1’s very existence is bound inextricably to its complex finances. Race hosting fees are one of the three biggest sources of income for the sport. Income on which every team depends for their survival. The other two streams are broadcast rights and sponsorship. Both are at risk when there is no show in town.There is a complexity too to the relationship of the players involved. The organisers do not want to be the ones to cancel a race, for risk that they will lose their race fee. Likewise F1 do not want to be the ones to do so or be held responsible for failing to deliver their product to broadcasters and sponsors and potentially having to return the race fee. Between them the FIA apparently also tries not be held culpable for cancellation for fear any of the other parties find them responsible.This gordian knot tied F1 to coming to Australia, and it was only ultimately severed as things fell apart. Not solved by Alexandrian invention but rather as the teams departed, simple expediency.“If cash was king we wouldn’t have made the decision we did today,” said Carey, despite every apparent indication that those involved had been muscled, kicking and screaming into making the decision. The circumstances he kept insisting were impossible to predict, although the coronavirus was presenting such a clear and present danger across the globe. “In many ways this is an unprecedented situation,” he said. “I have never lived though anything like this. the magnitude, the extent, the unpredictability, the fluidity of this.”As the conference due to a close, sporadic, weighty drops of rain began to fall as if the skies of Victoria itself were calling time with a slow hand clap on an unconvincing performance.More fallout is to come and goodwill toward F1 will be a casualty here as well. Outside the track, fans who had not seen an F1 wheel tun in anger were left disappointed and angry. These are fans F1 can ill-afford to alienate and the overwhelming impression was that it would have been better to simply have taken the bold step to postpone in the interests of safety long before.As things stand Melbourne may just be the first domino. McLaren have announced that 14 members of the team and the one confirmed case are now in quarantine at the team hotel for 14 days. No other team members will be able to go the factory for 14 days after returning to the UK. With the Bahrain GP set to take place behind closed doors next weekend McLaren’s participation looks all but impossible and with them potentially backed by other teams goes the strong likelihood that race will not happen.Carey acknowledged that Bahrain was now an urgent issue in Melbourne. “We have to deal with it imminently,” he said. “In the very short term we need to be addressing the immediately upcoming events, we expect to address that with our partners, the FIA our partners in Bahrain.”Similarly he had to visit Vietnam just before coming to Australia to hold talks in Hanoi as the meeting there is reportedly on the brink of bring being pulled. There is, one might surmise, a pattern here. It might yet do F1 some good to learn from Australia and accept that sheer will alone is not enough to make these three opening meetings happen. To take the hit, and take stock in how the sport might exist in a world where the coronavirus has changed the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/387d6a6e5ec726061a6f4e824ab2d3fc742141d9/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8f4549fb67501f80eeb879cde3b7b4","title":"talking horses al boum photo to claim repeat victory in gold cup horse racing tips","story":"Having waited so long for a first success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Willie Mullins is poised to make it two in a row, thanks to last year’s winnerHaving waited so long for a first success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Willie Mullins is poised to make it two in a row, thanks to Al Boum Photo (3.30). The rangy bay ground his way remorselessly to the prize a year ago and something similar will probably be good enough against a list of rivals with questions to answer.For years, Mullins used to joke that he had no idea what makes a Gold Cup winner but the formula he hit on with Al Boum Photo last year, having a quiet prep run at Tramore on New Year’s Day, has been repeated.His effort in south-east Ireland looks even better than last year’s and he should be hard to beat.Some in this field can win if they return to their best, like Kemboy, who has been gradually working back to form, and Lostintranslation, whose King George run was hopeless. Stable form is a concern for him.Race times on Thursday suggest there is still plenty of juice in the ground, so Clan Des Obeaux may struggle to stay the trip. Santini and Delta Work are highly capable but possibly just short of the required level. If there is a shock, it could be Chris’s Dream, a progressive type with Henry de Bromhead. The way he bolted up in the Troytown suggests he may stay on into the places here.1.30 Triumph Hurdle There is the potential for a real burn-up here and that ought to help A Wave Of The Sea, widely seen as a lucky winner of one of the key trials at Leopardstown. He stayed on strongly and this more galloping circuit will play to his strengths. The question is whether Solo may have gone beyond recall by the time he gets going.2.10 County Hurdle It has been a superlative week for JP McManus, who has one of the most interesting runners in Saint Roi. He jumped poorly on his Irish debut but was a lot slicker and quicker at Tramore on New Year’s Day and looks very fairly treated for this handicap debut.2.50 Albert Bartlett Hurdle Poor efforts this week by Sporting John and Defi Du Seuil provide something to worry about for fans of Thyme Hill, their stablemate. His route, from the Champion Bumper, is not the most conventional for this race. Latest Exhibition looks a stout stayer in the making and he was good enough to overcome a steady pace last time.4.10 Foxhunter Chase The Festival has not been kind to Shantou Flyer, twice a runner-up here, including in this race. But Hazel Hill, who beat him a year ago, is 12 now and this is a big chance to turn the form around. Shantou Flyer has since joined the underappreciated Rose Loxton.4.50 Grand Annual Chase Gordon Elliott is well placed to take the final two handicaps, starting here with Chosen Mate. He has been making steady progress over fences in non-handicaps and is somehow rated lower than when contesting a Grade One at Aintree last spring.5.30 Martin Pipe Hurdle Elliott has a few contenders for this, a race he always targets, and Column Of Fire appeals most, with the promising Eoin Walsh aboard, trying to follow up his Leinster National win from Sunday. Column Of Fire stayed on well to be third of 28 on his handicap debut last time and there is better to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/919c9bfb155e7572f2f9b9a9b4f2ae21b5ae6a8f/0_12_4293_2576/master/4293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb7049a3a55e5f4973925394d4f95bd3","title":"australia v new zealand first one day international live","story":"15th over: New Zealand 43-1 (Guptill 22, Williamson 10) Target 259 Taking seven off it, that’s New Zealand’s best over since the third of their reply, Williamson taking it to Mitch Marsh with a lofted drive down the ground for four. I think it’s fair to say already that Williamson will need to get 130-odd if they are to win this. 14th over: New Zealand 36-1 (Guptill 21, Williamson 5) Target 259 This is a very good conversation with Lyon on telly, who is usually pretty guarded when asked to talk about himself. He says that it wasn’t until he claimed 150 Test wickets that he felt comfortable in the Australian team. Blimey. I mean, we sense that covering his career - he’s always nervous and his route to the top wasn’t conventional. But still, that’s quite the bout of impostor syndrome he’s suffered from - however unjustified in his case. Starc is spot on here again from around the wicket, just a single to cover from Guptill. The required rate is now in excess of a run a ball. 13th over: New Zealand 35-1 (Guptill 20, Williamson 5) Target 259 Mitch Marsh into the attack and nailing his length, banging it in outside the off-stump. “He’s the heartbeat of the side,” declares Nathan Lyon on commentary. You get a real feel for that in the new documentary, just how much his colleagues love him. It turns into an excellent first over, five dots at Guptill before the opener collects a single down the ground to finish. Australia have taken 110 from the last five overs. 12th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Guptill 19, Williamson 5) Target 259 The classic Kane Williamson back-cut, beating backward point with ease to get off the mark. That was a shot Bradman made his own and the New Zealand captain does a pretty good impression of it. A couple more singles off Starc to finish. Better batting.11th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Guptill 18, Williamson 0) Target 259 Nathan Lyon is in the Fox commentary box and Kerry O’Keeffe is enjoying telling a story about how there was far more attention on his brother Brendan as a kid. I know Nath and Brendo from before all this, during our club cricket days in Canberra for Wests. Anyway, whenever he makes runs for Australia, he always credits his big brother, who is a coach in Sydney these days. A great cricketing family. Meanwhile, guess what? Cummins sends down a picture-perfect maiden at Guptill. New Zealand already need a run a ball to win. Williamson needs to get to work and fast. 10th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Guptill 18, Williamson 0) Target 259 Out walks the New Zealand numero uno, Kane Williamson. He has two balls to see off in Hazlewood’s successful over and defends them both into the offside. The end of a superb power play for the Australian quicks - Hazlewood has 114 from his five. Lovely cricket! Oh, how Hazlewood and his colleagues earned that. From around the wicket, just outside the off-stump, Nicholls tried to push through cover. Instead, a thick edge was found, Carey doing the rest ing to his left. 9th over: New Zealand 27-0 (Guptill 17, Nicholls 10) Target 259 Big shout for caught behind from Cummins! Nicholls was hooking at a delivery from around the wicket and looked to miss it - indeed, he did miss it. Of course, StarcFinch blew Australia’s review with the second ball of their bowling innings. To that point, two quick singles were New Zealand’s lot. They’re going at just three an over.8th over: New Zealand 25-0 (Guptill 16, Nicholls 9) Target 259 Shot, Guptill up on the balls of his feet to steer three behind point early in the over off Hazlewood. Sure enough, regular programming quickly resumes. This is old school. 7th over: New Zealand 21-0 (Guptill 13, Nicholls 8) Target 259 The TV broadcaster is showing some analysis between overs of how accurate the Australians have been so far, “right on a hanky” says Brendon Julian. It’s Cummins’ turn to turn the screws. Sorry to be repetitive - blame the Australian fast bowling prowess. They wouldn’t mind a wicket before this power play is over, though. A cherry on top.6th over: New Zealand 18-0 (Guptill 11, Nicholls 7) Target 259 Outstanding start this from Australia’s top-tier pace trio, Hazlewood once again giving Guptill absolutely nothing. Remember, the experienced New Zealand opener has routinely taken Australian attacks down over the years in this form of the years. The bowling is just too good for any of that so far, even through the field is up.5th over: New Zealand 17-0 (Guptill 10, Nicholls 7) Target 259 Cummins is into the attack and smacking the ball in short of a length always so consistent. I spent the last couple of days smashing through the documentary about the Australian team and the reputation of many players is enhanced by their participation in it, not least Cummins. We can overdo this sometimes, but he’s such a likeable bloke. 4th over: New Zealand 14-0 (Guptill 9, Nicholls 4) Target 259 Lovely delivery, Hazlewood beating Guptill by the proverial coat of varnish. But he bounces back well to finish, timing a drive through cover for three. No rush at all for the visitors.3rd over: New Zealand 9-0 (Guptill 5, Nicholls 4) Target 259 That’s a nice way to get off the mark, Nicholls crunching Starc to the rope with his best shot, the cut.“I’m cranky about this ODO not being on free to air,” Doc Marianne Webb tweets at me. You can do that too, of course. Or email if the observation runs longer than 280 characters. “Admittedly I’m also cranky about other things like panic toilet roll buying...but still! I guess it comes down to $$, yes?”The long, long story short is that CA was very keen to land a billion dollar TV deal. To achieve this, they required Foxtel (i.e. Pay TV) to be part of the mix. To help get them over the line, some trade-offs were required. Thus, this set-up.2nd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 4, Nicholls 0) Target 259 Hazlewood has been quite outstanding with the white ball since returning to the ranks in India a couple of months ago having been overlooked for the World Cup. Blimey, what a marathon summer this was. Remember when it started, with those T20s against Sri Lanka? Anyway, Hazlewood has been adamant that he wants to play in the T20 World Cup in October (provided it goes ahead) and is giving himself every chance of doing so. Guptill miscues three over mid-on, not convincing at all, the rest of the over landing in in a shoebox. A very good start from Australia’s two big quicks. 1st over: New Zealand 1-0 (Guptill 1, Nicholls 0) Target 259 Ian Smith says on TV broadcast that Finch wasn’t at all sure until making the review sign. Watching back a real-time replay after the technology confirms the decision, we get a feel for just how ambitious it all was. “That was not a good process,” Smith concludes. Alas, Guptill is off the mark later in the over with a push into the onside. NOT OUT! For a lot of reasons, not least the fact that it pitched outside leg. HAS STARC TRAPPED GUPTILL LBW SECOND BALL? He likes it so much that Finch is convinced with review with one second to spare. Stand by. The players are back on the field. New Zealand dragged Australia back very nicely with the ball, can make the most of it in the early stages of the chase? Guptill and Nicholls are opening up for the visitors and Mitch Starc has the new ball. PLAY! Thanks, Scott. Well, to say the world has changed since the last time we spoke on the OBO just five days ago for the T20 World Cup Final would be a tremendous understatement. It’s going to be an eerie series but we’ll do the best we can to take your mind off the world around us. If you want to go back into the time machine - and don’t we all - Geoff Lemon and I recorded a new ep of The Final Word earlier in the week to reflect on the wonderful night at the ‘G. That might also be soothing as we wait for the players to return to the field in about 15 minutes. Chat then.Hard to know exactly what to make of this offering from Australia. With Warner and Finch scoring at will in the early overs, a score north of 300 looked on the cards. But once the first wicket was broken with 124 runs on the board, a rot of sorts set in. Undoubtedly the slowing SCG pitch played its part, but wonderful bowling in the middle from Santner (2-34) and to a lesser degree Boult (0-37) saw the runs evaporate and the wickets tumble. Australia were made to work very hard for their runs - not a single boundary was scored between the 37th and 48th overs - and but for Labuschagne (56 from 52) Australia might have been forced to settle for as score not far north of 200. The par score for a team batting first at the SCG is around 300, so this looks a tad on the thin side, but if runs are as hard to come by this evening New Zealand will have to bat well to win. Of course, all of this is being played out before an empty stadium. Strange, concerning times. That’s all from me. I’ll now place you in the safe hands of Adam Collins.50th over: Australia 258-7 (Cummins 14, Starc 9) A good last few balls for Australia, with Starc collecting eight runs from the final three to take Australia past 250.A tired-looking shot from Labuschagne, who can do no more than squirt a full-toss to Taylor at backward point. He’s run his legs off today, so no surprise. Starc and Cummins to see Australia home.49th over: Australia 248-6 (Labuschagne 56, Cummins 13) Labuschagne shuffles across his stumps and is struck in front by Boult, the latter’s leg-before appeal landing on sympathetic ears. Labuschange is on his way, but not if the batsman has anything to do with it. Review! And a good review at that, with the ball hitting the Australian some way outside the line of off-stump. Not out! Cummins then looks like he’s picked up another boundary, but some excellent fielding in the deep by Nicholls keeps the shot to three. One over to come.48th over: Australia 239-6 (Labuschagne 50, Cummins 10) A single brings up Labuschagne’s second ODI fifty, and off just 46 balls this has been an important innings. The crowd again (doesn’t) go wild. Cummins then gives himself room and gets one right out of the screws, punching Sodhi over extra cover for a big six. Just the third maximum of the day but also the first boundary of any kind since the 36th over.47th over: Australia 226-4 (Labuschagne 49, Cummins 2) Boult returns for his final foray and just four singles come from his penultimate offering. Six down facing probably New Zealand’s best bowler today, Australia remain watchful.Carey comes and goes, sending a premeditated sweep into the outstretched hands of Boult at backward square. Two wickets in the over for Sodhi.Marsh’s uncertain stay comes to a certain conclusion as he plays a shot with grand intentions but humble outcomes, finding Guptill at extra cover.45th over: Australia 221-4 (Labuschagne 43, Marsh 27) Labuschagne indeed does take a risk, slashing heartily at Santner outside off, and though he doesn’t middle it he still picks up a hurriedly run three. Another risky shot follows, a sweep over midwicket that somehow lands safely, and seven runs come from Santner’s final over. His return of 2-34 from 10 overs was a joy to watch. Pretty much instigated New Zealand’s resurgence.44th over: Australia 214-4 (Labuschagne 39, Marsh 24) Sodhi continues and it’s clear this deck is slowing by the over. The batsmen are either approaching the ball or standing and waiting until it arrives. They’re forced to force the issue but it’s tough going. We are in ones and twos territory unless you’re prepared to take risks. Five from the over. Surely the risk taking isn’t far off.43rd over: Australia 209-4 (Labuschagne 36, Marsh 22) Neesham strays onto the pads of the right-handers but New Zealand are stacked on the fence on the leg-side. Fours are proving hard to come by but ones and twos flow readily. Six from the over.42nd over: Australia 203-4 (Labuschagne 32, Marsh 20) Sodhi returns and four singles is Australia’s net return. The hosts pass 200 and one - well, me - wonders when the shoulders will open and the shots will be played.41st over: Australia 199-4 (Labuschagne 30, Marsh 18) Neesham returns to the attack, leaving Boult with two overs up his sleeve. Australia, and Marsh in particular, appreciate the release in pressure, taking five from the over. Not many, I know, but it’s been tough going lately. A recession of runs, if you will.Kind of ...40th over: Australia 194-4 (Labuschagne 29, Marsh 14) Santner again and more of the same: more tight, probing, hard-to-play slow bowling, that is. Three from the over. And when you consider this is the 40th over, that is commendable. The pitch has slowed somewhat, no doubt, but this has been some fightback by New Zealand.39th over: Australia 191-4 (Labuschagne 27, Marsh 13) A rare bad ball from Boult - too short, too wide, too slow even - is cut past backward point for four by Marsh. One poor delivery in eight overs. We can forgive Boult for that.38th over: Australia 184-4 (Labuschagne 25, Marsh 8) Now Santner returns, and with Boult at the other end you can see what Williamson is thinking: keep the squeeze on for as long as possible. Do that to good effect, and Australia will throw their wickets away. Maybe. Three from the over. Great slow bowling.37th over: Australia 181-4 (Labuschagne 23, Marsh 7) Sketchy fielding from Williamson gifts Australia some free runs but still a good over (of course) from the returning Boult. Just three runs from it.36th over: Australia 178-4 (Labuschagne 22, Marsh 5) Ferguson errs onto Labuschagne’s pads and pays the price as the right-hander gets enough on it to find the fine-leg fence. Two more come, courtesy of some frantic running, and then Marsh gets in on the act with another glanced boundary. Poor bowling from Ferguson when New Zealand wereare in the position to turn the screw.Sodhi on for Santner and you’d think that can’t be good for New Zealand given Santner’s present form and state of mind. But Short pretty much tosses his wicket away, pulling tepidly over midwicket and handing Nicholls some free catching practice. I don’t think I’m the toughest judge, but I’m not sure about D’Arcy Short. Kiwis on a roll.34th over: Australia 160-3 (Short 5, Labuschagne 9) Ferguson loosens the shackles somewhat, straying in line and length, as Short and Labuschagne help themselves to ones, twos and threes in a better over for Australia. Here’s the Smith dismissal.33rd over: Australia 153-3 (Short 2, Labuschagne 5) Just one run from Santner’s latest offering. My he’s bowling well. In the space of 10 or so overs, Australia have gone from imperious to in peril. That is why we love cricket.32nd over: Australia 152-3 (Short 2, Labuschagne 4) CDG is back in the attack, Williamson clearly wanting Boult in his pocket for the death overs. Another good over for the Kiwis, who’ve owned this middle period, with four runs coming from the over. Welcome to the fray, James Hannan: “Thanks very much for sharing the video of “THE UNDERARM INCIDENT” and Australians doing what we do best. I sent it to my Kiwi friends. I was eight at the time, and watching it now you gotta love Richie who at the end of the video delivers a scathing attack on G Chappell and co. The look and little head shake he gives the camera when he says, ‘Well, perhaps they might advance that as an excuse for what happened out there today. Not with me they don’t!’ They don’t make ‘em like him anymore!”No they don’t, James, no they don’t.Here it is again if you missed it.Another one bites the dust. This is an excellent spell from Santner, who now counts Smith among his victims as the right hander misses his attempted back-foot drive and is bowled off-stump. Wonderful period for New Zealand, this.30th over: Australia 146-2 (Smith 14, Short 0) Another fine over from Boult - he’s now 0-14 from six overs - keeps Australia to one run and Short hoping his eye is in soon.Sure is weird today with nobody in the stands.Nice bowling from Santner to tempt Finch into the cut shot, but the Australia skipper is cramped for room and succeeds only in feathering one to the keeper. A good innings from Finch, as per Warner, but no wickets quickly become two and perhaps New Zealand are now back in this one.28th over: Australia 143-1 (Finch 59, Smith 12) Boult returns, and after the exhilaration of the previous over normality returns. Two runs from the over. Ho-hum.ICYMI, here’s that ridiculous shot from Smith.27th over: Australia 141-1 (Finch 58, Smith 11) Shot! Pure, unbridled Steve Smith brilliance. Arrogantly, dismissively, nonchalantly even, he steps across the crease and clips a straight, full one from Ferguson high and wide over the backward square fence. Can’t really think of another player in the world who could play a shot like that. All wrist, all class. The crowd (doesn’t) go wild.26th over: Australia 132-1 (Finch 57, Smith 3) Neesham is wild and wide of off stump - and Finch’s expansive shot is almost equally as wild - but it comes out on top as his thick edge flies over gully for four.So that’s where it’s coming from. Ferguson’s pace has been good today and he hurries Warner into a pull shot that gets big on him quicker than he expected, resulting in an easy catch for Sodhi at mid-on. Warner’s 88-ball dig comes to an end and that was desperately needed by the Kiwis. Exit Warner, enter Smith. So not all bad for Australia then.24th over: Australia 124-0 (Warner 67, Finch 52) Neesham strays down leg and is clipped for four by Warner. From where on earth is this first wicket coming?23rd over: Australia 119-0 (Warner 62, Finch 52) Another change for New Zealand, and a change of ends for Ferguson, as Sodhi is sent for a spell. Warner is kept on his toes by a short one but manages to keep it down as the over goes for five runs. Into the middle period now, Australia might be thinking attack as opposed to the usual accumulation. Ten wickets in hand is big.22nd over: Australia 114-0 (Warner 59, Finch 50) Neesham returns, hopefully for his sake with little memory of that very costly over early in the innings, and while he is more economical here Australia continue to score at will. Finch registers his 26th one-day century with a single, the milestone coming from just 56 deliveries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

During this period, Cardiff docks were the hub of the global coal trade and the Exchange saw upwards of 10,000 traders a day passing through its doors. The beautiful, cream limestone, Renaissance-style edifice – once the haunt of Roald Dahl’s Oslo-born father Harald – eventually fell into disrepair.

It was built, in classic totalitarian style, to house the Nazi regime’s Ministry of Aviation in the mid-1930s. Surprisingly, it survived the destruction meted out to most of the city in the second world war and became the Haus der Ministerien (House of the Ministries). To show its new communist purpose, a huge tile mosaic was created on the north side of the building, depicting the idealistic dream of life in East Germany.

Redfield responds in the affirmative: “Some cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.”Redfield’s vague answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China – that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead.“The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!” one commentator said. “The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,” another said. “American coronavirus,” one wrote.The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on 27 February that although the virus first appeared in China “it may not have originated in China”.Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not “equate to it being the source”. He told reporters: “But neither can we conclude that the virus came from abroad. Only through investigation and tracing can we answer that question.”Yet only Zhong’s first comment has stuck, repeated by Chinese diplomats, state media and officials who have subtly encouraged the idea. On Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman suggested without evidence the US military might have brought the virus to the Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. Zhao Lijian accused the US of lacking transparency, saying on Twitter: “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” China’s ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily “made in China”.An editorial in Xinhua last week also echoed Zhong: “The epidemic was first reported in China but that does not mean it necessarily originated in China … The WHO has said many times that Covid-19 is a global phenomenon with its source still undetermined.”Officials have framed the campaign as a protest against the “politicisation” of the outbreak by countries such as the US, where some officials have continued to use the terms “Chinese coronavirus” or “Wuhan virus,” despite the World Health Organization’s discouragement. But analysts say China may be looking to deflect blame as the coronavirus spreads around the world.“We might be heading into first global recession caused by Chinese Communist party mismanagement,” wrote Bill Bishop, author of the China newsletter Sinocism. “Previous manmade disasters in China since 1949 never really spread outside the People’s Republic of China’s borders in meaningful ways.”“This time looks to be different … And that is likely one of the reasons the propaganda apparatus and PRC officials are pushing so hard the idea that virus may not have originated in China,” he wrote.For weeks, Chinese state media pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan as the likely origin for the virus while researchers said the source had not yet been determined, but few have floated the idea that it came from outside of China. Another respected Chinese researcher, Zhang Wenhong, said in an interview with the China Daily that he did not believe the virus had been imported into China.“If that was the case, we should have seen patients emerging from different regions in the country around the same time rather than their concentration in Wuhan,” he said, in comments that later appeared to have been removed from the interview.“I think the consensus is still clearly that the virus did originate in China,” said Jane Duckett, professor at the Scottish Centre for China Research, University of Glasgow, focusing on Chinese policy and health.“This would appear to be a nationalist narrative aimed at countering criticism of the Chinese government for not better managing the outbreak in its early stages,” she said.Shifting the narrative may also be important as China tries to move forward, now that new infections appear to have levelled off. This week, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began as state media pronounced “victory is near”. State media showed elaborate celebrations marking the closure of the last of the temporary hospitals in Wuhan.“This is a propaganda effort aimed at the domestic audience. Among the Chinese public, there is a general awareness that delays in notifying the public led to many more infections in Wuhan,” said Victor Shih, a politics professor at the University of California, San Diego.He said: “This campaign is aimed at distracting the public from the party’s delayed response.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35704d963b979b7da350d2620db65cc6994a1fb6/1093_1658_3274_1965/master/3274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df310d48c720e530d766194b94c31969","title":"coronavirus as many as 10000 in britain may already have it says pm","story":"Up to 10,000 people may already have coronavirus in Britain and many families should expect to lose loved ones before their time, Boris Johnson warned on Thursday as he set out measures less stringent than those taken by other countries.Medical, scientific and public health experts criticised the steps outlined to tackle what the prime minister described as the “worst public health crisis for a generation”, including ending school trips abroad, stopping older and vulnerable people taking cruises and the use of self-isolation for a temperature and cough lasting four hours.Schools are to remain open and large gatherings such as sports events and concerts will go ahead, amid concerns that moving too soon with stricter measures could bring public fatigue, though the prime minister said both measures remained under consideration.The moves put England and Wales at odds with neighbouring countries. Scotland moved to ban gatherings of more than 500 people from next week, while the Republic of Ireland and France became the latest countries to announce the closure of all schools.Johnson’s moves came as the stock market in London suffered its blackest day since 1987, with panic selling – triggered by Donald Trump’s surprise ban on travel between the US and the Schengen zone – surpassing the worst seen in the 2008-09 financial crisis.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus\u0026nbspcan be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is\u0026nbspavailable here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 9 March,\u0026nbspmore than 110,000 people have been infected\u0026nbspin more than 80 countries, according to the\u0026nbspJohns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have\u0026nbspover 3,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland\u0026nbspChina.\u0026nbsp62,000 people have recovered\u0026nbspfrom the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.In other developments, the Electoral Commission urged the government to postpone local and mayoral elections in May, while next week’s planned Brexit talks in London were called off. Universities across the country began to cancel in-person lectures in favour of online teaching.Thursday’s press conference was told that Britain, where the death toll had risen to 10 and where there are 596 diagnosed cases, is believed to be four weeks behind Italy, which has seen 1,000 deaths and more than 15,000 infections. In the UK, the infection is expected to build to a peak in May or June.Speaking at a sombre press conference in Downing Street, the prime minister said measures to tackle “the worst public health crisis for a generation” could “cause severe disruption” to everyday life for months.“It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,” Johnson said, as two more fatalities from Covid-19 brought the death toll in Britain so far to 10.Dismissing the belief that the virus is comparable to seasonal flu, he added: “Alas that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous,” with the elderly at particular risk. Entire families could be told to self-isolate if one of them falls ill, and people should start looking after elderly relatives and neighbours, he added.Ministers and health chiefs are bracing themselves for an imminent sharp rise in infections and deaths. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK are thought to have the virus now, as it spreads undiagnosed.From now on, anyone with symptoms of the coronavirus must stay at home, schools should not undertake trips abroad and those aged over 70 with underlying health problems should not go on cruises, he said.However, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised the government for not doing more, saying that countries that had closed schools and “acted earlier on social distancing” had seen success in halting the spread of the virus. He said people would be concerned that the government had not adopted policies such as the banning of external visits to care homes. “I think most people’s priority is their elderly loved ones who are most vulnerable,” he said.Experts also criticised the measures as too limited to have a major effect and inadequate, given the scale of the looming threat to health.“I can’t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact … none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK,” said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the university of East Anglia.Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for northwest England, said: “This is a kind of ragbag with no particular logic to it … they are issuing some semi-directive things but they are not really doing what we need to do, which is to mobilise and encourage communities, neighbourhoods, families to form their own plans for the next period in which the local situation will influence what happens – whether it’s not going out to eat, or stopping sporting events.”Coming on the day that Ireland decided to close all schools and colleges until 29 March, Johnson’s decision not to dramatically upgrade the government’s response highlighted again the stark difference between the UK’s approach and that of other European countries, which have instigated tougher action.The UK is among a dwindling number of European countries – others include Belgium and the Netherlands – not to have introduced at least a partial closure of its schools. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced measures including a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people yesterday, but said closing schools would do more harm than good at this stage.Flanked by Vallance and Whitty, Johnson defended their tactics.“The measures that I have discussed today … staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly – making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home – these are the three most powerful defensive lines,” he said.But Hunter said older people had been “left out on a limb” by ministers not setting our more detailed plans to protect their health.Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the UK’s response “has clearly not been sufficient”. He and other experts called for much more extensive testing and tracing of the contacts of those diagnosed with Covid-19.However, there was broad support for schools staying open, given children’s low risk from the virus and the economic and practical impact of parents left unable to work because they were looking after their offspring.Signs that financial markets were starting to freeze up in response to growing evidence of economic distress caused by the pandemic created echoes on Thursday of the near-collapse of the banking system in 2008 and prompted an emergency cash injection from America’s central bank.But the action by the New York Fed was not enough to make good the damage caused by Donald Trump, and botched attempts by the European Central Bank to reassure investors proved counter-productive.But the pain suffered by sectors seen as especially sensitive to travel restrictions and weaker consumer demand was only part of a wider selloff that saw a fall in the share price of every FTSE 100 company.Since the markets started to take fright at the economic implications of Covid-19 in late February, the FTSE 100 has fallen by more than 2,000 points to 5,237 and seen its value plummet by £543bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96b1d59ed1bdc74599338b3280f6bdfb4e78c074/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32937ec3e11d871db55f1c94fdc44c61","title":"coronavirus iran mass graves qom","story":"Trenches in city of Qom confirm worst fears about extent of the epidemic and the government’s subsequent cover-upSatellite images of mass graves in the city of Qom suggest Iran’s coronavirus epidemic is even more serious than the authorities are admitting.The pictures, first published by the New York Times, show the excavation of a new section in a cemetery on the northern fringe of Iran’s holy city in late February, and two long trenches dug, of a total length of 100 yards, by the end of the month.They confirm the worst fears about the extent of the epidemic and the government’s subsequent cover-up. On 24 February, at the time the trenches were being dug, a legislator from Qom, 75 miles (120 km) south of Tehran, accused the health ministry of lying about the scale of the outbreak, saying there had already been 50 deaths in the city, at a time when the ministry was claiming only 12 people had died from the virus nationwide.The deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, held a press conference to “categorically deny” the allegations, but he was clearly sweating and coughing as he did so. The next day, Harirchi confirmed that he had tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.Since then, members of Iranian parliament, the Majlis, a former diplomat and a senior adviser to the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, have died. Another Khamenei adviser and one of the most powerful voices in Iranian foreign policy, Ali Akbar Velayati, was reported on Thursday to have been infected. The top ranks of Iran’s clerical leadership are particularly vulnerable because of their advanced age.According to the latest health ministry figures, more than 10,000 Iranians have fallen ill from the virus and 429 have died.Amir Afkhami, who has written a history of Iran’s experience of cholera epidemics, A Modern Contagion, said the mass graves add weight to suspicions the real mortality figures are much higher and are still being covered by the leadership.“It doesn’t surprise me that they are now trying to create mass graves and trying to hide the actual extent of the impact of the disease,” Dr Afkhami, an associate professor at George Washington University, said.He added that the close trading partnership between Iran and China, and the government’s fear of disrupting that partnership had contributed to the early and rapid spread of the disease.“Because of China’s status as the country’s principal commercial partner, the Iranian government took inadequate cautionary measures to restrict and monitor travelers from China,” Dr Afkhami said. “Then, later on, Tehran’s lack of transparency and unwillingness to take robust measures such as social distancing and quarantine, particularly at the epicenter of the outbreak, helped spread the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5695715e38c31d641f57a279d36537b99be929/0_336_4011_2406/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc180dc8adc3085bfe38d9bc85f35e3c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i see a doctor","story":" What is Covid-19, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and at what point should you call a doctor? It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 12 March, more than 125,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have over 4,600 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. 68,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deba668502d9443bf8ed8757c8f8ffe2675514a6/0_119_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05b3841626e4afff7a10233934d942fb","title":"ireland school closures reveal stark contrast to uk covid 19 response","story":"Critics of UK coronavirus measures call for joint strategy on island of IrelandIreland is shutting schools, universities and childcare facilities to delay the spread of coronavirus in contrast to the UK, which is keeping education institutions open, exposing a stark ergence in response to the crisis.Irish authorities said the shutdown would begin at 6pm on Thursday and last at least until 29 March as part of a series of restrictions, including a ban on mass gatherings, that would be kept under review.The unprecedented closures put pressure on Boris Johnson to follow suit – or to explain the decision to keep schools open. The British prime minister gave a press conference later on Thursday after a meeting of Cobra, the government’s emergency committee, where there was no change in the UK’s stance.Asked earlier about Dublin’s announcement, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We follow our own advice, they will do the same.”The prospect of erging responses caused consternation on both sides of the Irish border and prompted calls for a joint strategy on the island of Ireland. Daniel Baker, the lord mayor of Belfast city council, said it would seek guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive and Public Health Agency.Unionists, who usually prefer to follow London rather than Dublin, disagreed over whether the threat of coronavirus justified an all-Ireland approach.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced the partial lockdown at a hastily arranged press conference in Washington DC before meeting Donald Trump for a traditional meeting ahead of St Patrick’s Day.“I know that some of this is coming as a real shock,” he said. “And it’s going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives. And I know that I’m asking people to make enormous sacrifices. But we’re doing it for each other.”All indoor gatherings of 100 people or more and outdoor gatherings of 500 or more should be cancelled, Varadkar said. State-run cultural institutions will close but public transport will still run.The lockdown is not as drastic as Italy’s. Shops, cafes and restaurants will remain open, as will airports and ports. Travellers with Covid-19 symptoms are being asked to self-isolate.The taoiseach said he was acting on the latest medical advice. “The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed. Acting together as one nation we can save many lives. Our economy will suffer but in time it will bounce back.”Ireland recorded 27 new infections on Thursday – by far the biggest daily rise – bringing its number of confirmed cases to 70. There has been one confirmed death, of an elderly woman with an underlying medical condition. Northern Ireland on Thursday recorded two new cases, bringing its total to 20.The prospect of erging strategies on school closures prompted criticism that authorities were acting as if coronavirus would respect the 310-mile border between the north and south of Ireland.Northern Ireland’s health minister, Robin Swann, told Stormont’s health committee that deaths should also be expected in Northern Ireland but that so far it was not “in the same place” as the Republic. “Our approach is different as there are no signs of community transfer.”Other unionists disagreed. “Since coronavirus doesn’t give a damn about borders or identities it makes sense for NI to follow immediately,” tweeted Alex Kane, a unionist commentator.Jamie Bryson, a loyalist blogger, said Northern Ireland had to recognise it shared an open land border with Ireland. “Regardless of the rights or wrongs of that open border, it is a reality. We face a health crisis that could result in deaths of many people. It is sensible to coordinate the approach between both jurisdictions.”Within minutes of his statement on closures and restrictions shoppers packed supermarkets across Ireland to stock up on toiletries, tinned food, pasta, rice and other products.“A fresh supply of toilet paper on the shelves, all gone, pasta, going, wipes, forget about it,” said a manager at SuperValu in Dun Laoghaire, south Dublin, as people with full trollies and baskets queued at cash registers.Similar scenes played out across the country. Several supermarkets briefly closed to restock. “As a result of unprecedented numbers of customers in some stores this afternoon we had to put some health and safety measures in place,” said a Tesco spokesperson.Retail Excellence, an industry representative, asked people to stop posting images on social media of empty shelves, saying it was sensationalising the issue.Authorities urged people to stay calm and not stockpile, saying supply chains were robust. “People do not need to panic buy. Supermarkets \u0026amp shops will remain open. Stockpiling could cause problems - please don’t do it,” tweeted Heather Humphreys, the business and enterprise minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2dfe3bea4ebf0d50f30a3984c0a3b591c31d06/1656_845_2525_1515/master/2525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feccf7b9fcf4d953a480f1f50f11b197","title":"no 10 coronavirus briefing reassuring in its lack of reassurance","story":"Government scientists show jittery prime minister Boris Johnson how to treat the public as adultsThings fall apart. Just a little, at any rate. Moments after the latest Cobra meeting had broken up, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, went rogue and gave her own press conference.The coronavirus pandemic had gone beyond the “containment” phase and into “delay”. People with a dry cough and a fever should self-isolate. Large gatherings of more than 500 in Scotland would almost certainly be banned from Monday. Enough time to make sure the Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic could be played on Sunday.A little over an hour later, Boris Johnson emerged into the familiar setting of the Downing Street state room to give his third coronavirus presser inside two weeks. There will be plenty more to come.His message was pretty much identical to Sturgeon’s, other than to declare that sports events and concerts would be going ahead in the rest of the UK for the foreseeable future. His irritation at being pre-empted by the first minister on further measures was mostly kept in check. Only a barb at the lack of resilience in the Scottish health service betrayed his feelings.Boris was here to tell the country we were in for a long haul, but he already looked on his knees. He has aged appreciably over the last few weeks. The eyes are puffier, the bags baggier and the complexion pastier. Being prime minister is turning out to be a lot less fun than becoming it. He looks sleep-deprived.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The responsibility is weighing heavy. He isn’t used to being held accountable for anything – his whole life up till now has been an exercise in self-indulgence – but he knows that he will be forever judged by the decisions he makes now. The smirking clown might have worked well for Brexit, but now the country is demanding a serious leader.Just for the moment, he is having to fake it to make it. And it’s just about working. The man who has a psychological aversion to bad news is having to level with cosmological truths. The soft-soap, occasional comic asides and veneer of self-confidence have given way to something more real. The sense of despair and self-doubt that Boris has worked so hard throughout his life to keep internalised is now etched into every line of his face, drenched in every sentence he haltingly utters. Having to tell a lot of people they might die can do that to you.Sensibly, Boris had once again come flanked by the new de facto joint prime ministers – the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance – and he rightly deferred to them on matters of science and epidemiology. Both men were hugely impressive: when they were sure of the numbers they said so, and when they weren’t they also said so.There was no artifice, no bullshit. Just cold hard truths. We were about four weeks behind Italy and the virus might not peak for nine to 14 weeks. There was almost something reassuring in their lack of reassurance. For the first time in years, the public were being treated as adults. Just about the only question ducked was the one about what constituted being “old”. Something of personal concern to those of us in our early 60s.Inevitably, most of the questions from the media were about whether the UK was doing enough. Other countries were closing schools, closing borders, closing down large public gatherings, closing travel. We were just advising people with symptoms to stay indoors for seven days, schools to cancel overseas trips, and people to wash their hands. With the proviso we would probably be implementing stricter measures at a later date.Not for the first time, it felt as if many in the country were ahead of the government in their response to the coronavirus. Many people had seen what was going down in Italy and had already cancelled large social gatherings, non-essential travel and were making plans to work from home where possible. Better safe than sorry.Boris, Whitty and Vallance were as one, though. The science was on their side. Which presumably meant that it wasn’t on the side of all those countries who had made more radical, earlier interventions. The three amigos were insistent that if we moved too soon, people would get bored of taking the proper precautions when the pandemic spiked. Not everyone in the room was wholly convinced. The idea that everyone would be running round the streets coughing over one another when they knew the risk of infection was at its highest just because they had already been cooped up for a few weeks seemed far-fetched.But the science was the science. And Boris was banking on his science being the right science. He wasn’t to be forced into doing anything before it could be shown to have a noticeable effect. In the meantime, he wished everyone well and asked for everyone to look out for one another. Especially the vulnerable and the elderly. Brexit was never going to bring the country together. But coronavirus just might. As he left the press conference, Boris had his fingers firmly crossed. So did I."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"uk coronavirus cases how many are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Here are the next steps in different areas, and the justifications they gave for them.Experts have warned consistently about the importance of not moving ahead too quickly with dramatic lifestyle changes to try to deal with the virus. Anything too onerous suggested by the government – such as a two-week isolation period for a whole household – might be adopted enthusiastically for a few weeks but then people get bored and leave their homes just as the peak of the illness hits, the government fears. A complete and immediate “lockdown” on movement could suppress the virus for a short time but it would return once measures are lifted, the government believes. Instead, the aim is to push the peak back toward the summer months and bring in more stringent measures down the line.There will now be a shift in testing. The contain phase was about isolating inidual cases, getting a diagnosis and then “contact-tracing” the people they have spent time with and asking them to self-isolate. Many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Instead, those with the most serious symptoms will be given a blood test in a hospital, and the NHS will move into a phase of prioritising the most seriously ill.Scientists and medics are using this phrase a lot, and it means the highest potential rate of cases. For the UK, the peak is expected to fall in three months’ time, likely in the summer months, and tail off throughout the autumn, the government said. Vallance said that the UK is around four weeks behind Italy, where there have been 1,000 deaths and more than 15,000 cases. The peak also brings the biggest period of challenge for the NHS. There are 5,000 ventilated beds but the service is looking to increase that number. Without a cure, the main treatment is oxygen therapy, which can be provided through a mask, and the NHS is looking to increase supplies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e173baed81b1674ee11cfa85841fb6b7c5d4d4/0_169_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2146442fb2392996398bb873d172f01b","title":"uk universities switching to online lectures and exams","story":"Medical schools to pause teaching and clinical exams to reduce pressure on NHSBritish universities are ending in-person lectures in an effort to arrest the spread of Covid-19, saying they will switch to remote learning and even online exams for students within weeks.The London School of Economics, King’s College London, the University of Durham and Manchester politan University said they would soon end face-to-face teaching in favour of digital delivery, including video lectures and online seminars.The announcements came as several universities said they planned to curtail public events, with Cambridge University’s medical school and others looking to pause teaching and clinical exams because of the pressures on the NHS.The LSE announced the most ambitious plans, saying all undergraduate and postgraduate courses will be “delivered online” by 23 March for the rest of the academic year, with many of its overseas students wanting to return home immediately.King’s College London and the LSE also plan to stop in-person examinations, with the LSE saying that all undergraduate and taught postgraduate exams and assessments this summer would be taken online or graded using alternative methods.“LSE has been preparing for a range of scenarios and, given the exceptional circumstances, we believe the best decision is to move to online assessments now, to give you as much notice as possible,” the LSE’s director, Minouche Shafik, told students.“Whilst we are changing our mode of teaching and learning and taking measures to be responsive to an evolving situation, LSE’s campus will remain open. We have had no indication from Public Health England that we should close, and buildings, services and facilities will run as usual.“Staff and students can be on campus and our LSE Library and halls of residence are also open to you.”The decisions to stop students congregating in lecture halls are at odds with the UK government’s position that schools and colleges should remain open where possible. The universities’ stance follows that of US institutions, such as Harvard, which have kept campuses open but ended lectures and seminars in favour of remote learning.Durham University said all forms of campus teaching, including field trips and one-to-one tutorials, would be replaced with remote learning from next Monday for the final week of term before the Easter holidays.“Please do not turn up to classrooms next week,” Claire O’Malley, Durham’s pro-vice-chancellor, told students in an email.“We know that this may be not be your preferred method of learning and that being in classrooms is an important part of your university experience. However, moving to online learning will help limit exposure to Covid-19 by reducing group activities. This will help all of us as the coronavirus spreads.”Malcolm Press, Manchester politan University’s vice-chancellor, warned students that the university “is also planning how best to deliver assessments, exams and credits, should we need to change our usual processes for the summer term”.Cambridge University confirmed that its medical school is among those that are planning to halt clinical teaching for its trainee doctors.“In the light of the Covid-19 outbreak and the pressure this is putting on the NHS, the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine has cancelled its final clinical examinations, subject to approval from the General Medical Council,” the university said.“The exams would have involved students interacting with large numbers of NHS patients and they require over 200 examiners, all hospital doctors or GPs, over a two-week period. “The students have already completed their final written examinations and been assessed on clinical competence in previous examinations and on placements in a range of clinical environments.”An email to Cambridge medical students from the school said: “We have had to make some extremely difficult decisions based on the principle that students going in and out of clinical environments could be an unnecessary source of virus transmission, they may be putting their patients and themselves at greater risk and there may be too few staff available to deliver formal clinical teaching, either through pressure of work or illness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd7083eb48293bd32ac77063a607805fe39cd3ab/0_0_5351_3211/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251160b98d67322338e716bb8f36009a","title":"verdicts of experts on governments new coronavirus measures","story":"Medical and scientific experts react to Boris Johnson’s press conference as the UK moves into the delay phaseProf Deenan Pillay, professor of virology, University College LondonThe ways these measures are developed and issued will be balancing the urgency of trying to flatten the curve of the peak versus activities that are sustainable and realistic. The purpose of staying at home for seven days if you have a new continuous cough or a high temperature is to blunt the number of people contributing to ongoing transmission, and that is a very important step. It will help reduce deaths, but also reduce the number of people who are admitted to hospital and intensive care. From the situation in Italy, we can see that intensive care is one of the services that will soon become overwhelmed.It’s very sensible to try to limit the chances of infection in those at high risk of needing intensive care. We can also see around the world that cruise ships are more likely to have older people, but also that the cruise ship environment is an ideal chance for infections to circulate widely.Banning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches, and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread it to others. It’s a sensible measure before closing the schools.Many organisations and businesses are already implementing working from home and reducing meetings. I’m surprised there’s not an emphasis on that, it would be good for government policy to reflect it.I’m very pleased there isn’t the sort of reaction we’ve seen in the US to close borders. This infection is now circulating in the UK and it’s important that, wherever those infections come from, there’s an understanding that we’re responsible for dealing with all of them and avoid the xenophobia that has emerged and that would be perpetuated by an insular approach.Empowering ill people to stay home is a good thing. Some might have felt that their employers would not allow this, and the government mandate gives them license to do the sensible thing and stay home just in case.Not closing schools seems understandable to me. Children will be the least likely to be affected, and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you’re keeping a very large number of parents away from work – as long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it’s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.I was surprised and disappointed to see nothing on testing. The people with suggestive symptoms should be tested during their self-isolation, so that we can maintain more reliable data about the actual real-time reach and spread of this epidemic, and so that crucially their immediate contacts can be traced. What is government doing on increasing our supply of testing kits and the workforce to go out and test people at their homes? I was disappointed to hear no update on that.Not banning major events now is the biggest disappointment and surprise for me. I think buy-in would be high anyway – many will already choose not to attend. The virus is clearly circulating in communities, and large gatherings in confined spaces could accelerate onward transmission.Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine, Norwich Medical School, University of East AngliaI was expecting there to be something a bit more rigorous. I can’t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact on the current situation.The guidance about self-isolating if you have any respiratory symptoms for a week is absolutely spot on. I’m not sure how many people will actually follow that advice – we shall see. But even if people ignore the advice themselves, you can imagine that if they turn up to work, colleagues and bosses will be on their case and there will be increased peer pressure.Just telling elderly people to not go on cruises isn’t enough to protect them. I would’ve hoped we’d be seeing more targeted advice for elderly and vulnerable citizens on what sort of things they should be thinking about. I think they’ve been left out on a limb.The issue for me with not going on cruises would be not so you can protect yourself – it’s because you could get quarantined for god knows how long. It’s the same for the new advice on school trips: you don’t want them going off and then travel bans come in and they’re quarantined in a hotel. However, none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK. I think at this point we are being perceived as lagging behind a lot of countries. And presumably other countries are basing their decisions on scientific information too.I would like to see a bit more about why they’re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. I’m sure it’s based on good quality science. But we don’t know what that science is. The science isn’t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this.I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it’s valid. Unless that happens, there’s a risk of losing the trust of the scientific community and the public.One of the biggest reassurances from my perspective is having Chris Whitty as chief medical officer. Of all the chief medical officers we’ve had in the last few decades, he is the one with the best background to have coped with this.Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for north-west EnglandThis is a kind of ragbag with no particular logic to it. The fact that they are now declaring we’re moving into this second phase, as if it’s some kind of planned event, is really meaningless. We need to mobilise the whole community response to this and they are behaving in a top-down way, in a half-hearted way, so it’s neither one thing nor the other.They are issuing some semi-directive things but they are not really doing what we need to do, which is to mobilise and encourage communities, neighbourhoods, families to form their own plans for the next period in which the local situation will influence what happens – whether it’s not going out to eat, or stopping sporting events. It will be determined by the data, which they should be sharing promptly and fully with everybody so that people can decide for their town, village, neighbourhood what they need to do.If everybody reduced the amount of mixing time that they’ve got, that would help to slow things down. We should take this as an opportunity to develop home working. Universities don’t need so much bricks and mortar because there’s so much learning online.What we’ve got is this cack-handed centralised country trying to run everything from London.

The order doesn’t include schools, universities, or public transport. The government also stepped up travel advice to say Australians should reconsider non-essential overseas travel.Satellite images of mass graves in the city of Qom, first published by the New York Times, have suggested Iran’s coronavirus epidemic is even more serious than the authorities are admitting.Justin Trudeau’s wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a visit to the UK with flu-like symptoms, and the Canadian prime minister is now self-isolating.“Although I’m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon,” she said in a statement. “Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.”Peter Dutton has announced that he has tested positive for Covid-19 after waking up with a sore throat and a fever and getting tested. He says “I feel fine”.In Melbourne fans arrived at the gate of the Australian Grand Prix to learn that the event had been cancelled. The decision followed days of concern over the risk that the large gathering would pose, including from racing team participants themselves.A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus, according to a note sent to UN missions, making the woman the first known case at the world body’s New York headquarters.Gabon and Ghana became the ninth and tenth countries in sub-Saharan Africa to register positive cases.In Italy, where the outbreak has taken a devastating toll, all Catholic churches in Rome closed under orders from the Vatican.The papal vicar for Rome said the churches would reopen when a broader Italian government crackdown on public gatherings expires on 3 April. “The faithful are consequently exempt from their obligation to fulfil the festive precept,” a statement from Cardinal Angelo De Donatis said.South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since the country’s first patient was confirmed on 20 January, raising hopes that Asia’s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing. Manila, home to 12 million people, is preparing for a lockdown that will be imposed from Sunday. All schools will be closed, mass gatherings suspended, and many public sector workers told to stay home, following a spike in cases in the Philippines.President Rodrigo Duterte has also imposed a 30 day ban on domestic land and sea travels to and from Manila, which will begin on 15 March.Speaking at a press conference after an emergency Cobra meeting, the British prime minister said: “We have all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous.“It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f99466093267d690ed672c5a60c0b082e3bebb7/0_249_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a9b785ec04a65001ae8c29e874601f6","title":"coronavirus lifestyles of the rich and famous how the 1 are coping","story":"While the rest of us face the pandemic, the wealthy are donning face masks, boarding private jets and heading for the hillsCoronavirus may have no respect for social, racial or professional boundaries, but even during a pandemic, as F Scott Fitzgerald observed, the very rich “are different from you and me”.While most of us are panicking about having enough toilet paper or whether we can work from home those with the means are making other arrangements.Given the choice of fight or flight, flight is the preferred option of the wealthy. Private jet travel is booming, with as much as a tenfold increase in bookings, allowing travelers to avoid large hubs identified as entry-points for coronavirus and avoid contact with strangers.The need to solicit business has been overtaken by demand, according to Jerod Davis, owner of Southern Jet. “The request lines are just crazy right now,” Davis told Slate.﻿It helps if you have somewhere safe to go. New Zealand is top of the list for Silicon Valley billionaires such as Facebook investor Peter Thiel, who owns 193 hectares (477 acres) of the country’s pristine South Island.“In this country, people are heading for the hills,” Borkowsky said. “At the memorial, not one person was handshaking and I’ve never seen so many Aesop hand-cleansers in one room. Lots of people were either heading out of London, or those that hadn’t were either talking about doing so or self-isolating.It also helps to have friends in high places.The Trump administration, which initially downplayed the pandemic, has lost no time making testing available to political loyalists.Two congressional Republicans, Matt Gaetz of Florida and North Carolina’s Mark Meadows, the incoming White House chief of staff, were both tested after exposure to a Covid-19 carrier at the annual conservative conference near Washington DC last month.Both said they were exhibiting no symptoms of illness, rendering their testing in apparent defiance of the government’s own recommendations that healthcare providers prioritize tests for hospitalized patients who are exhibiting coronavirus symptoms, elderly and those with underlying health issues.If the jet is grounded, or you have to mix with hoi polloi, there’s always a face mask.The US surgeon general, Jerome Adams, has urged the public to stop buying them. “Seriously people,” Adams wrote on Twitter, “STOP BUYING MASKS!”That didn’t stop Naomi Campbell from boarding a plane in Los Angeles decked out in a full white protective suit and wearing a 3M N95 mask – the hospital-grade mask that doctors and coronavirus experts say are in short supply.Campbell’s less than chic new look followed a a selfie by Paris-bound Gwyneth Paltrow wearing a since sold-out “urban air mask” by a Swedish company, Airinum. Paltrow starred in the prescient 2011 drama Contagion about a deadly viral outbreak.“Paranoid? Prudent? Panicked? Placid? Pandemic? Propaganda?” wrote Paltrow, who now apparently refers to herself in the third person. “Paltrow’s just going to go ahead and sleep with this thing on the plane. I’ve already been in this movie. Stay safe. Don’t shake hands. Wash hands frequently. 😷”But, sadly, wherever the super-rich go, they take themselves with them.Quarantine may prove too much for wealthy couples forced to stay home and deal with intimacy issues rarely encountered by the jet set.Mitchell Moss, who teaches urban policy and planning at New York University, told Bloomberg News: “This is going to destroy the marriages of the rich … All these husbands and wives who travel will now have to spend time with the person they’re married to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fed07d6d76070c8f169c09ba98962b4e1337087a/0_77_5315_3190/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45db20baef75b7ee860dd22e7daba2de","title":"coronavirus what happens to peoples lungs when they get covid 19","story":"Respiratory physician John Wilson explains the range of Covid-19 impacts, from no symptoms to severe illness featuring pneumoniaWhat became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 and early 2020 in the Chinese city of Wuhan as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause.The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacks that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54181033db1acd9bbc3cd2bb6f4b329d797b013d/0_274_6060_3636/master/6060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b7d7a3eeaf9a68d48555e07af38cb27","title":"first covid 19 case happened in november china government records show report","story":"Earliest case detected on 17 November, weeks before authorities acknowledged new virus, says Chinese mediaThe first case of someone suffering from Covid-19 can be traced back to 17 November, according to media reports on unpublished Chinese government data.The report, in the South China Morning Post, said Chinese authorities had identified at least 266 people who contracted the virus last year and who came under medical surveillance, and the earliest case was 17 November – weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus.The Chinese government was widely criticised over attempts to cover up the outbreak in the early weeks, including crackdowns on doctors who tried to warn colleagues about a new Sars-like virus which was emerging in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.The data obtained by the Post, which the  has not been able to verify, said a 55-year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person to contract Covid-19. For about one month after that date there were one to five new cases reported each day, the report said, and by 20 December there were 60 confirmed cases.The virus, which is now a pandemic, has infected at least 128,343 people across the world and killed 4,702. Of those who have contracted the virus since it began, 68,324 people have recovered.Almost 81,000 of the cases occurred in China, mostly in the province of Hubei.Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed case had been diagnosed on 8 December. Doctors who tried to raise the alarm with colleagues about a new disease in late December were reprimanded. Authorities did not publicly concede there was human-to-human transmission until 21 January.Jonathan Mayer, professor emeritus at the University of Washington’s department of epidemiology, said it was “entirely conceivable” there were cases as early as mid-November.He said there were three possibilities: that cases weren’t detected at the time, that they were detected but not recognised as a new disease, or they were detected and recognised but reporting was suppressed.“I have no way of knowing which of these possibilities in fact happened,” Mayer told the .“We know that there are reports of early suppression of reports of cases, and the ‘whistleblowers’ dealt with rather severely. But in fairness, the signs and symptoms of C​ovid-19 are non-specific and even now, without confirmatory testing, it is easy to mistake this for another disease.”Mayer said it was highly improbably that patient zero would ever be identified.The origins of the virus have become part of US-China diplomatic conflict, fuelled by US officials calling the disease “Chinese coronavirus” or “Wuhan virus”. It’s widely accepted, including by the head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention that the virus originated in Hubei. However in recent ​weeks Chinese officials have started suggesting or outright claiming that the virus ​did not ​originate​ in China, but perhaps in the US​, a conspiracy theory that is gaining traction​.On Thursday, Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesman, suggested without evidence that the US army may have brought it into China.“Epidemics always have become political,” said Mayer. “Governments seem opposed to admitting that things were handled imperfectly, yet it is only by identifying the imperfections and shortcomings that things can be addressed to do a better job next time. With emerging infections, there will always be a next time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb763183be999a9984302df1e9b413ac8dc4af2/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a83a4fdb731be212cfdc73520da235","title":"coronavirus closes down italy","story":"With Italy in lockdown, Peter Beaumont charts the spread of Covid-19 in the country while Lorenzo Tondo describes its impact.

It comes after Costa Rica suspended mass gatherings and asked public sector workers to work from home on Monday. The country’s tourism industry has reported thousands of cancelations and a fall in bookings as the pandemic spreads around the world. The Central American only has a handful of cases, but there are growing concerns that the deportation of migrants from the US and Mexico could accelerate the spread of coronavirus in the region. UCL university in London has confirmed that one of their students has tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement on the university website UCL President Professor Michael Arthur said “UCL’s immediate priority is to support our student, as well as their family and friends. The student has not been on campus in the last ten days and has self-isolated at home. They do not live in UCL student accommodation. Our Student Support \u0026amp Wellbeing Team is in close communication with them and we ask that their privacy is respected.”Professor Arthur said “It is inevitable that there will be further cases in the coming days and weeks as cases increase in the UK.”He said that students would not be penalised for not attending classes if they do not feel comfortable being on campus.You can read the full statement here: https:www.ucl.ac.uknews2020marmessage-provost-about-confirmed-case-coronavirus-uclMy colleague Sam Jones reports that the regional government of Catalonia has ordered around 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for a fortnight from 9pm tonight after a steep increase in Coronavirus cases in the area.Igualada, Vilanova del Camí, Santa Margarida de Montbui and Òdena have been placed in lockdown after the number of cases linked to a hospital in Igualada rose to 58 on Thursday.“No one is allowed out of these affected areas,” the regional government said on Thursday evening. “Only emergency personnel and vehicles bringing fuel and food supplies will be allowed to move round the area.”The move comes almost a week after neighbourhoods in a small town in the northern region of La Rioja were placed in lockdown after a cluster of cases was traced to a funeral in the nearby Basque Country.Meanwhile, Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, has confirmed he has tested positive for coronavirus days after the party’s general secretary, Javier Ortega Smith, was diagnosed with the virus. Earlier this week, the party apologised for holding a 9,000-person rally in Madrid on Sunday.Belgium’s prime minister Sophie Wilmès has announced the closure of Belgium’s schools from Friday at midnight until 3 April when the Easter holidays begin.Restaurants and bars have been ordered to close and only essential shops such as supermarkets and pharmacies may stay open on the weekends. Citizens are being advised to work from home but public transport will continue to run.Former Health Secretary and current Chairman of the Health Select Committee Jeremy Hunt was interviewed on Channel 4 News earlier this evening about the UK’s response to coronavirus. Hunt challenged the logic of delaying social distancing measures, saying “I’m surprised we’re not moving sooner”.“The places that have succeeded are the ones that moved earliest to social distancing ...I think people will be concerned that we’re not moving sooner to more social distancing, for example banning external visits to care homes.”“I am concerned because we’ve got four weeks, We’re four weeks behind Italy and what we do every single day of those four weeks is absolutely critical. I don’t want to second guess the advice that scientists are giving but I would like to see what the modelling is from the behavioural scientists that says we can go too early with some of these measures because I think most peoples priority is their elderly loved ones who are most vulnerable.”In what was a remarkably frank interview, Hunt said there was “all to play for” in the coming weeks and described the announcement today to delay social distancing measures as “puzzling”.“In light of Arsenal’s announcement tonight confirming that their first-team coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for COVID-19, the Premier League will convene an emergency club meeting tomorrow morning regarding future fixtures.”As it stands all Premier League matches are scheduled to go ahead as planned this weekend.Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for coronavirus.

The pictures suggest that the coronavirus outbreak is more serious than the Iranian authorities are admitting.Julian Borger has the full story: Here’s a video of Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders slamming President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreakHospital bosses are delighted with Boris Johnson’s continued insistence that school closures would not help combat coronavirus.  “This decision will obviously be welcomed by the NHS and those leading organisations at the frontline of caring for patients with the coronavirus”, said a senior leader in the NHS. “We are in a very fast moving and unprecedented situation and trust leaders are working hard to ensure that they have the plans, resources and capacity to respond to the inevitable increase in cases and key to that is having enough staff in place. This is one less issue to have to manage at this stage, but they are clearly planning ahead and looking at how they can continue to provide patient care if the situation does change.”Two hours before Johnson’s press conference Richard Beeken, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, tweeted his view -- which is widely-shared in the NHS:One senior hospital executive told me recently that trusts are acutely concerned about school closures because that could produce a very difficult “double whammy” of large numbers of staff off to look after their children at the same time as hospitals are suddenly being hit by a really significant surge in patients left seriously ill by Covid-19. Boris Johnson’s government was not the only one to get a hammering today from a senior health official for its handling of the virus outbreak. Dr Anthony Fauci, a top federal health official, has said that the U.S lag in coronavirus testing is a failing, and claimed improvements are needed. Experts say the U.S simply isn’t testing enough people. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now”, said Fauci. “That is a failing. It is a failing, lets admit it.” Large-scale testing is a critical part of tracking the spread of infectious diseases and allocating resources for treatment. The lack of comprehensive figures means U.S. health providers could quickly be overwhelmed by undetected cases.As of this afternoon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was reporting about 1,260 U.S. illnesses, a number that trailed independent researchers, who are adding reports from inidual states more quickly. Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles this week estimated that the true count of infections was close to 9,000 about two weeks ago.Markets have continued to plummet today as the US and UK stock exchanges suffered their worst performance since Black Monday in 2008. Read our full report here: My colleague Leylan Cecco reports that Canada’s most populous province will shut down schools for two weeks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. All publicly funded schools in Ontario will be shut down from March 14 until April 5, 2020. “We recognize the significant impact this decision will have on families, students, schools, as well as the broader community, but this precaution is necessary to keep people safe,” the province said in a statement this afternoon, the day before schools closed for a one week spring break. The advice to shutter all schools came from Ontario’s chief medical officer, Dr. David Williams, who also called on people to refrain from attending large events in the coming days. The surprise decision follows remarks from premier Doug Ford earlier today that appeared out of step with the cautious messaging from neighbouring provinces. “I just want the families and their children to have a good time. Go away, have a good time, enjoy yourself,” he told reporters Thursday. “We’re going to be monitoring the situation as it changes every single day.”Ontario now has 59 cases of the coronavirus. Our Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly has just followed a press conference in Berlin headed by Angela Merkel, which followed hours of heated discussion between the leaders of Germany’s 16 Länder at an emergency meeting over what steps Germany’s biggest economy should be taking, after the number of people with coronavirus rose to 2695 and the number of dead, rose to six.Many Germans were glued to livestreams of the press conference, expecting and hoping to hear some decisive measures, such as the closure of schools and kindergartens across the country. What they got was a sense of urgency which we have not heard up until now. In short, the meeting’s participants concluded that Germany is now in crisis mode, with a plan to be unrolled with immediate effect to restructure the country’s hospitals in order to boost the number of intensive care beds (currently there are 28,000 of them, 25,000 of which are equipped with respiratory apparatus). All non-urgent operations are to be postponed. The state will offer financial help to the health insurance companies to ensure this happens, Merkel said. She appealed to Germans to restrict social contact as much as possible. She also advised on the cancellation of all gatherings which are not strictly necessary. She said the next “4, 5 weeks” would be “very very crucial in determining the question as to what happens next”.Markus Söder, premier of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, admitted that the situation was “far more dramatic than we had thought even one or two weeks ago”. He said that the government’s quick introduction of so-called ‘Kurzarbeit’ - or work reduction policies introduced at the height of the banking crisis, which ensure workers receive their wages, and see employers compensated by the state “send an important signal to German businesses”. He coined a phrase used by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank at the height of the Euro crisis, “we will do whatever it takes”.Although many Germans had hoped or expected they might do, the leaders did not decide on:- a universal policy on closing schools, kindergartens and universities, although Söder did announce this evening that Bavaria (which currently has 500 people with coronavirus, and one death) will do so from tomorrow, becoming the first state to do so.- Neither did it decide on the closure of German borders (though it will control them including checking temperatures).- Neither did it decide to stop flights to and from Italy.Should schools in Britain shut? Interestingly, although other countries such as Italy and Ireland are doing that, there appears to be no groundswell of medical or scientific opinion in the UK that it should follow suit.There are slightly mixed opinions among experts surveyed by the Science Media Centre (https:www.sciencemediacentre.org), but no one urging immediate closures like those seen elsewhere. “Not closing schools seems understandable to me”, said Dr Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College London. “Children will be the least likely to be affected and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you’re keeping a very large number of parents away from work. As long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it’s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.”Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, is more sceptical. “I would like to see a bit more about why they’re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. Every mother and father knows that when kids go back to school they’re going to get hammered by colds and flus and sore throats.”He would like to know more about how ministers and government advisers reached their decision. “I’m sure it’s based on good quality science. But we don’t know what that science is. The science isn’t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this. I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it’s valid.”Dr Charlotte Jackson, from the UCL Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, points out that school closures have proven effective against outbreaks in the past. “There are examples from the UK and elsewhere of school closures reducing transmission of influenza. During the 2009 flu pandemic, the UK saw a reduction in cases following the closure of schools for the summer holiday, and an increase when schools reopened in the autumn. There are also studies from various other settings, including France, Hong Kong and Mexico, suggesting reductions in transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza associated with school closures. Social distancing measures in general did seem to slow down transmission in US cities during the 1918 flu pandemic”, she says. However, that does not mean that they would help delay the spread of the Coronavirus, she adds. “With the current coronavirus outbreak, countries have generally used lots of control measures at the same time (this also happened during the 1918 flu pandemic) so it’s difficult to separate any effects of school closures from other interventions. I wouldn’t like to comment definitively on whether closures would be effective for this particular virus.” What about Boris Johnson’s new policy of advising schools against overseas trips? Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at UCL, says: “Banning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition of the virus. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread to others.

Photograph: PAYou have to go back to the second World War to look for parallels to the events unfolding in Ireland and across much of Europe. Certainly, there has been nothing in this writer’s lifetime to match the breadth and severity of the measures just introduced by the Government to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Neither is there much in our recent experience to match the speed with which events have unfolded, and the speed with which the threat has escalated.Earlier this week, Ministers indicated Ireland would publish its national plan for tackling Covid-19 next Monday. This was already late in the day Britain published its plan 10 days ago.A plan will provide an anxious public with a route map for dealing with the crisis and show how the Government plans to proceed through the stages to meet, and ultimately see off, the threat posed by the disease.Unfortunately, the situation is worsening so fast that there was no time to wait for publication of the plan before introducing a widespread shutdown of public services and restrictions on public gatherings.This sudden change of pace was further underlined when Ministers on Thursday morning announced the closure of schools and creches countrywide for the rest of the month. About the same time, the Health Service Executive was publishing a guide to “Getting your school, college or educational setting ready for Covid-19”. This document will not be needed for a bit.The Government and public health officials are talking about leaving the present state, when we were trying to contain the virus, to now enter a “delay” phase. There was no talk of a delay phase in the early pronouncement by the experts, who said we would move from containment to mitigation if demanded by circumstances, but the idea seems to have been borrowed from the British plan.Whatever about the phrasing, these measures are drastic and, as Ministers acknowledged, they raise many questions. Closing schools and creches, for example, gives rise to massive childcare challenges for many families. Some parents will have to stop working in order to plug the gaps. Losing healthcare workers as a result would be the equivalent of shooting ourselves in the foot.Will closing schools be effective? And simply shutting the schools is not an answer in itself. Children can become vectors of the disease outside the classroom too, unless they follow the rules of correct hygiene and social distancing. The threat to elderly relatives could rise rather than fall, as a result.The move to pull the shutters down on much of public life was triggered by an upsurge in confirmed cases in recent days, as well as the nature of some of the cases we have. Covid-19 cut a swath through hospitals in Limerick and Cork over the past week, infecting staff and patients and forcing hundreds of contacts into self-isolation.There have been two cases of community transmission, which means we don’t know the source of the infection in these cases. Doctors have been saying for days there is much more out there than has been recorded because we have not been testing widely enough.With computer modelling predicting a rapid rise in cases, it was clear the always stretched Irish health system would be overloaded within weeks. Meanwhile, the disease was gaining a firm foothold across continental Europe, now the new epicentre of this disease.This left policymakers feeling they had only one option: strike hard now in the hope this will delay the onset of cases, delay the spike in admissions and curb the spread of the disease.In the United Kingdom a different approach is being taken. This seems to involve an acceptance of some community transmission, at least at levels with which the National Health Service can cope. Consequently, the social restrictions being imposed are far less intrusive, so far.For now, the Irish public is fully behind the Government’s restrictions. The social distancing and hygiene messages have been clearly communicated and, hopefully, clearly understood. People seem to be up for the vast social experiment involved, whether it involves distance learning or remote working. Whether that remains the case if weeks turn into months remains to be seen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Putin trying to project strength with bomber flights off Ireland, claims retired US admiralRenewable heating grants scheme could yet cost the Northern taxpayer up to \u0026pound490mHe now owes \u0026pound51,000, which includes \u0026pound23,000 for a gas-fuelled heating systemBAI will run up to three open funding rounds annually for \u0026lsquoinnovative programming\u0026rsquoCommuter train is taken out of service following blaze on Thursday nightNine clusters of cases identified as schools and colleges are closed until March 29thHSE orders more ventilators to cope but shortage of ICU staff may be bigger problemInfluential climate scientist sees no conflict between religion and science on climate changeTaoiseach announces closure of schools, colleges and other public facilitiesFoster \u0026lsquodisappointed\u0026rsquo that Executive not informed in advance of Varadkar\u0026rsquos decisionLeaving Cert and Junior Cert oral and practical exams to be postponedGarda investigators have gathered CCTV footage of the suspectsDublin\u0026rsquos Protestant cathedrals, St Patrick\u0026rsquos and Christ Church, now closed to touristsFirst company to announce restrictions says virus can significantly impact supply chainsStopping large gatherings expected to slow spread of virus, says chief medical officerInformation about our emerging new reality and plans to slow the spread of Covid-19Restrictions on court hearings introduced to reduce numbers in courtroomsLeaving Cert and Junior Cert oral and practical examinations are set to be postponedStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201415.1584036559!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cash for ash inquiry report why the findings are so important","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster Foster admitted that she did not read the legislation behind the Renewable Heat Incentive. File photograph: The More than three years since the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry was established in January 2017 the chairman, Patrick Coghlin, is to publish his findings at 2pm in Stormont on Friday, March 13th.The so-called “cash for ash” scheme brought down the Northern Executive and Assembly, tarnished the reputation of Northern Ireland politicians and civil service and could cost the Northern taxpayer up to half a billion pounds.So, what is the background to the scandal?Q\u0026ampA:Friday, March 13th, unlucky for some, is a big day in Northern Ireland?Yes, at 2pm, at Stormont in east Belfast senior retired judge Patrick Coghlin will publish his long-anticipated report into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, also known as the “cash for ash” calamity – or “catastrophe” as one senior Northern Ireland civil servant, Andrew McCormick, described it. Why was it a catastrophe?The scheme was designed to encourage firms, businesses and farmers to switch from fossil-fuel heating to biomass systems such as wood-burning boilers. But unlike the scheme in England and Wales there was no cap on subsidies in Northern Ireland. This meant that for every £1 users spent on green-heating systems, they got £1.60 in subsidies – as was said, “the more you burned the more you earned”. That potentially could land the Northern Ireland taxpayer with a £490 million bill over the proposed 20 years of the scheme.Did RHI have\u0026nbspa political and an economic impact? It sure did. RHI was introduced by the North’s Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in 2012 when Arlene Foster was its minister.Three times between 2013 and 2015 whistleblower Janette O’Hagan tried to warn that the scheme was a licence to “burn” money, but politicians and civil servants were not really listening. It was not until December 2016 that the general public finally learned of the scandal. That was when Jonathan Bell, who had succeeded Foster as minister for enterprise, in an interview with BBC’s Stephen Nolan blew the whistle on the scheme. That triggered a series of events that led to Martin McGuinness the following month standing down as Sinn Féin deputy first minister, effectively collapsing Stormont.It took three years to build it up again.Will Coghlin’s report be a weighty tome? It will. It will attempt to make sense of a labyrinthine mess. There will be a multitude of angles for reporters and the public to digest – but essentially it is likely that the report can be broken down into four key elements: what it says about Arlene Foster and the DUP its verdict on DUP special political advisers, or spads as they are known its judgment on Sinn Féin and its evaluation of the competence of Northern Ireland civil servants up to the most senior levels.Explain about Arlene Foster and the DUP The scheme came into being when she was the responsible minister. Foster admitted that she did not read the legislation behind RHI. A total of 1,946 applicants were approved for the scheme. There was a spike of 984 applications in the three months from September to November 2015 after officials announced they were correcting the system but before that change took effect. This raised the question as to whether there was political pressure to extend the lifetime of RHI and where that pressure came from.What Coghlin finds about Foster and about the DUP could have a bearing on whether she can remain as DUP leader and First Minister.And why are the DUP spads so central to the story? It goes back to Bell’s December 2016 interview when he claimed that some DUP special advisers were “not allowing this scheme to be closed” – an allegation they have denied. There are also claims that the unelected spads carried great power and influence. There is the further issue of why one of the DUP spads, Andrew Crawford, as he told the inquiry, inappropriately passed on information about the scheme to a number of relatives.And what about Sinn Féin? One, there is the question over why the Department of Agriculture promoted the scheme when Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill was the agriculture minister – the department held 58 workshops explaining the benefits of the scheme when she was in charge.And, two, why over December 2016 and January 2017, when the controversy was escalating did the Sinn Féin minister for finance Máirtín Ó Muilleoir update senior republican back-room figures, Pádraic Wilson, Martin Lynch and Ted Howell on developments. And why in particular amid efforts to impose cost restrictions on RHI did he feel he had to email Howell to ask, “would you be content if I were to sign off the business plan” to reduce costs. As efforts continue to form a government in the Republic this all plays into the question, who runs Sinn Féin?Why will senior civil servants worry about the report? They have many questions to answer: why did they miss that RHI was not capped why did they not heed the warnings of the whistleblower Janette O’Hagan why did they not stand up to the spads why did they allow important meetings to take place without minutes being taken and generally why were they so ineffective in representing the taxpayer?Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201402.1584049184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus 27 new cases brings total to 70 in the republic","story":"Chief medical officer at the Department of Health Dr Tony Holohan says there were  27 newly discovered cases of coronavirus reported in Ireland today, by far the biggest daily jump in numbers since the start of the pandemic. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney announcing measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus with Minister for Health Simon Harris and Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan at Government Buildings on Thursday. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The Another 27 newly discovered cases of coronavirus were reported in the State on Thursday , by far the biggest daily jump in numbers since the start of the pandemic.The total number of cases in the Republic stood at 70, up from 43 on Wednesday.The massive increase in cases lies behind the Government’s decision to impose a wide range of restrictions on schools and social gatherings earlier on Thursday.The first case in the Republic was reported on February 29th.There are now nine clusters of cases, each involving between two and six cases, according to Dr Holohan.Of the additional 27 cases, 22 derived from contact with a previously confirmed case, two involved healthcare worker and three involved travel from an at-risk area.Dr Holohan said two of the new cases involved community transmission – meaning public health doctors do know where the infection originated.There are now a total of five community-acquired cases in Ireland. Six patients, including three of the new cases, are in intensive care and one patient has been officially reported as having died from the disease, on Wednesday.Asked about reports of a second death of a patient, in Cork, Dr Holohan said “we haven’t had another death confirmed to us”.Asked about the speed at which Thursday’s measures were introduced, Dr Holohan said these were always expected “at some point in time but it’s impossible to predict when until you get there”.Ireland still had a relatively small number of cases, he insisted, and the risk of contracting the disease, while real, was low.There were still too few confirmed cases to go on to build up an estimate of the number of cases in the community, he said.Dr Holohan acknowledged the difference in approach being taken in Ireland and the UK, where schools remain open.“We’ve assessed the situation from our point of view, and closing schools is an important part of our strategy particularly in relation to protecting older vulnerable people.”Ireland made the decision on Thursday to move to a delay phase in relation to Covid-19, he confirmed.“The European Centre for Disease Control have now advised early, decisive, rapid, coordinated and comprehensive implementation of social distancing measures. Ireland has today responded to this advice.”He added the National Public Health Emergency Team would meet again on Thursday evening to continue to review Ireland’s response.Delay phase is designed to interrupt the transmission of the Covid-19 virus, by advising reductions on social interactions.“This phase requires a community effort, every citizen acting responsibly in order to protect our vulnerable and elderly members of society,” the department said.School closuresEarlier, the Government announced that schools, colleges and other public facilities would close in the Republic from 6pm on Thursday for at least two weeks in response to the spread of the virus.It also urged people not to engage in panic buying as reports emerged of long queues in supermarkets.Minister for Health Simon Harris said he understood that people were worried and that they wanted to make provision for themselves and their families.But he said everyone should consider the “unintended consequences of taking something that somebody else requires”.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys said there was no need to stockpile because there was sufficient stocks in place. However, panic buying would “cause a problem” in the supply chain that currently did not exist.On Thursday morning, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the measures being announced would remain in place until March 29th and would be kept under review. * Schools, colleges and childcare facilities to close* Cultural institutions to close* Indoor gatherings of more than 100 people should be cancelled* Outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled* Public transport will continue to operate* People should continue to go to work, but those who can work from home should do so* Shops, cafes and restaurants to stay open* Measures begin at 6pm this evening and last until March 29th* Public transport will continue to operate. “I know that some of this is coming as a real shock and it is going involve big changes in the way we live our lives. I know that I am asking people to make enormous sacrifices. We’re doing it for each other,” Mr Varadkar said, speaking in Washington DC.“Together, we can slow the virus in its tracks and push it back. Acting together, as one nation, we can save many lives. Our economy will suffer. It will bounce back.”Northern IrelandThe Northern Executive has decided against following the lead of the Irish Government and is not ordering the closure of schools and universities in an attempt to limit the impact of the coronavirus.The North’s First Minister Arlene Foster also complained on Thursday evening that the Northern Executive was not informed in advance of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s decision in Washington to announce a number of actions to address the Covid-19 emergency.Ms Foster said it was “disappointing” that the Executive was not apprised in advance of the Government’s decision. She said the Executive had “no prior knowledge” of Mr Varadkar’s announcement.British prime minister Boris Johnson ramped up the UK’s efforts to combat coronavirus on Thursday, moving the government to the “delay” phase and telling British people with even mild symptoms to stay at home for seven days.However, he said he would not follow the example of Ireland and Italy and close schools to limit the spread of the disease. “We are not closing schools now, the scientific advice is this could do more harm than good.” But he said that the advice would be under review.Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said he currently expected the UK would reach the peak of its coronavirus outbreak in 10 to 14 weeks’ time. “If you move too early, people get fatigued,” he said, referring to the UK government’s response. “This is a long haul.”While sporting and cultural events in Ireland have been cancelled, the Cheltenham racing festival continued on Thursday. Death toll Italy, the centre of Europe’s coronavirus pandemic, has hit the milestone of 1,000 deaths since it saw its first cases in mid-February. The country’s positive cases continued their upward trend on Thursday, registering 15,113 confirmed cases and the death toll hit 1,016.As concern mounts over the impact on the Irish public health system, doctors gave their first public warning on Thursday night of the possible impact on treatment decisions for those requiring intensive care.Intensive care professionals issued a statement, saying: “We expect that there will be significant challenges in the coming weeks in terms of demand for our services.“We aim to provide care of an appropriate nature to our patients as always, but we do expect that we will have to make triage decisions, which will be challenging. At all times, we will communicate with the patient and their families. “Intensive care will need to be directed to those patients who are most likely to benefit, and in this instance, to save the most lives. Although we frequently change the direction of care from intensive care to palliative care, we never stop caring for patients especially at the end of life.”The statement was issued on behalf of the Intensive Care Society of Ireland (ICSI), Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine of Ireland (JFICMI) and the Irish Association of Critical Care Nursing (IACCN) which represents healthcare professionals who provide critical care in Ireland.Also on Thursday, the Government issued new guidance on civil and public service working arrangements.It says staff redeployment across the civil and public services could be required to ensure the maintenance of essential services, which is prioritised in the new advice.It also calls for the reassignment of staff within organisations to prioritise the most critical services. And it says employers should consider extending and staggering opening hours, as well as the introduction of flexible working.Kevin Callinan, general secretary of the Fórsa trade union, called on State departments to maintain discussions with the union and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to manage the situation appropriately.Speaking after Mr Varadkar’s announcement, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said thousands of lives can be saved through a collective national response to the measures.Mr Coveney said the measures being introduced were unprecedented in their scale and effect across society.“Never before has such drastic action been taken in face of a public health threat,” he told a press briefing in Government Buildings.This was not being taken lightly but was based on the advice of the best public health experts, Mr Coveney said.“The irony is that in order to pull together we are asking people to stay apart. The closures proposed will disrupt the everyday connectivity that makes us who we are,” he said.The Government is to publish the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team shortly and inidual Ministers are to hold briefings on the impact of the measures in their respective areas. A special Cabinet meeting is to take place on Thursday evening.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the measures were taken in the light of a significant increase in the number of cases, a number of ICU hospitalisation, one death, some clusters of cases, cases in hospital settings and evidence of community transmission.However, the outbreak here was still at an early stage, he said.He urged employers to stagger work times and break times. Restrictions are to be imposed for visitors to hospital, nursing homes and prisons, and spacing measures will be introduced in homeless shelters.The limits on mass gatherings are “clear recommendations”, he said.The first death from the disease occurred on Wednesday at Naas General Hospital. The patient, an elderly woman, had an underlying condition that was terminal.As of Wednesday evening, there were 43 confirmed cases in the Republic and 18 in Northern Ireland.The World Health Organisation (WHO) for the first time on Wednesday labelled the coronavirus a pandemic, adding Italy and Iran were on the front line of the disease and other countries would soon join them.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPARussia will continue to “probe” the “incredibly strategically important waters west of Ireland” with long-range air surveillance and nuclear submarines, a former US Nato commander has said.Retired US navy admiral James Stavridis, who was Nato’s supreme allied commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013, was responding to incidents of two Russian bomber aircrafts flying in Irish-controlled airspace west of the country twice over the past week.On Wednesday, British RAF “Typhoon” fighter jets were scrambled for the second time in five days to monitor two Russian Tupolev TU-95 “Bear” bombers as they flew in international airspace controlled by the Irish Aviation Authority. Adm Stavridis said that the Russians were testing a strategically important area called the Greenland-Iceland-UK “gap” that controls the entrances to the North Atlantic and transatlantic commerce between the US and Europe, the largest trading relationship in the world.Significant timing“This is attractive to Vladimir Putin because it demonstrates Russian military capability, creates some isive forces in Nato because there is a difference of opinion as to how robustly to respond and provides an image within Russia of a strong decisive leader,” the former US commander in Europe told The . Adm Stravridis referred to the significant timing of the military flights as the Russian leader seeks to extend his term of control to 2036 with recent proposed constitutional changes in Moscow.The Russian embassy in Dublin said that the two Russian airforce aircraft were carrying out a “routine training mission” in the North Atlantic. “The flight took place in the international airspace according to all international rules and standards,” said Russian embassy spokeswoman Victoria Loginova. “The aircraft at no point entered the sovereign airspace of Ireland, nor was there any plan to do it.”Jet forceAdm Stavridis said that building “a sophisticated jet force” in Ireland to conduct intercepts of Russian aircraft would be “extremely expensive”.He noted that the 16 fighter jets that former Irish air corps head Maj General Ralph James recently suggested would be required for a full air defence capability would be “an absolute minimum” that was required. “For true independence of operation, it would require additionally a more sophisticated radar and electronic sensing system directed west,” he said.He suggested a better solution would be to introduce a “defined air defence cooperative arrangement with the UKNato while also appealing to the European Union military forces”.Ireland could offer to host EU or Nato jets for “quick response” perhaps from France or Germany in a similar arrangement followed by the Baltic states, he said. Russia’s spokeswoman at the country’s embassy in Dublin said that Moscow has been flying these kinds of missions for many decades.“It has never been a problem for anyone except maybe for the British political and military establishment which has been exploiting for their own purposes the myth of ‘Russian threat’ throughout much of a modern history,” she added.

Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201459.1584038023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i had the coronavirus here s what you should know","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMorena Colombi is recovering in total isolation in her home close to Milan.“The doctor came in and said, unfortunately, the tests were positive. I had Covid-19.” Morena Colombi, a 59-year-old company worker, was an early patient in Italy’s coronavirus outbreak that has claimed 1,016 lives in the country.Now recovering in total isolation in her home close to Milan, she has decided to share her story to urge people to follow quarantine instructions, and to avoid hospitals unless absolutely necessary so medical staff can focus on saving people whose lives are threatened.“The measures the government has taken are absolutely necessary. People like me who don’t have other illnesses can survive it. But there are many people who have existing conditions, and it’s very dangerous for them,” she said.“It is very infectious. Someone can not know they have it, go outside, and pass it on to people who have existing conditions and for whom it is very dangerous. Unfortunately, we can’t know the state of health of everyone around us, so it is the responsibility of everyone.”Colombi’s illness began on Valentine’s Day. At first it seemed like an ordinary cold or flu: she felt chills, aches, and was stuffed up, though her nose was not running.“I felt extremely tired. I had no strength, I couldn’t even cook,” she recalled. “I had this awful dry cough that kept getting worse . . . at a certain point it began to be difficult to breathe.”When the first case of coronavirus was reported on February 21st, Colombi began to suspect she had the virus. She tried unsuccessfully to get a response from emergency and information numbers, before she put on a face mask and her son brought her to the local accident and emergency.“The doctors and nurses at first were reluctant to assess me. But I mentioned I had been in contact with people who had been in China about 10 days ago. At that point everything changed,” she recalled. “They also became worried, and put on masks and gloves.”She was the hospital’s first suspected coronavirus case. There were no isolation facilities, so nurses set up a trolley and a bedpan for Colombi in a disused office to keep her separate from other patients. There she stayed until February 22nd, when the results of her Covid-19 test came back positive.Colleagues at the company where Colombi works were placed in immediate quarantine at home for a fortnight, as were her family members. Colombi was transferred to a larger hospital with facilities for infectious diseases. Scans of her lungs showed her condition was not worsening, and as she was able to breathe independently, she was soon discharged as the beds were needed for patients in critical condition.Since then, she has been in total isolation in her apartment where she lives alone in the town of Truccazzano. On accessing the internet, she discovered that while she had been in hospital she had been the subject of panicked local gossip and false claims.“This annoyed me a bit, because it’s not like I’m pestilent, and if I walk down the street I infect the air. I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone,” Colombi said. “Everyone got a bit of a fright, thinking that in the preceding days I could have infected someone. But from what it seems here there’s no one else who is sick, luckily.”Colombi’s experience raises questions about how to manage patients who are recovering from Covid-19. In Italy, a fifth of Covid-19 patients have had “critical” symptoms. This has overwhelmed capacity in hospitals, meaning discharging patients who can cope at home is very important. But those patients need a support network to maintain isolation, as well as continuing tests until they are clear of the disease. There are still unknowns over how to safely ensure the infection is not passed on.“I’m in total isolation. Thanks be to God I have friends who can go to the shops to get groceries for me I call them and they leave them for me at the doorstep. But not having contact with people becomes difficult,” Colombi said.“I live on my own, so I don’t need to disinfect everywhere I touch in case I infect someone else. Unless I can catch it again myself. This is a big question, no one knows yet the answer to that,” she added.“I’m waiting for the result of my test and I’m hoping it will be negative. I still have a bit of a cold and I cough occasionally, but I cross my fingers and hope to God.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200138.1583953007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit michael gove declines to confirm irish sea checks on goods","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove arriving at the Cabinet Office in London. The British cabinet minister said an EU-UK joint committee would determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work. Photograph: Luke DrayGettyMichael Gove, the British cabinet minister who will negotiate the implementation of post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, has declined to confirm that checks will be required on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to the North.Mr Gove told a House of Commons committee that it would be for an EU-UK joint committee to determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work.“The effective working of the protocol is a matter for the joint committee to resolve and I’m looking forward to that meeting in order to ensure that we can develop the protocol and implement it in all its provisions in a way that ensures that the people of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland economy benefit,” he said.EU negotiators insist that the role of the joint committee, which is due to meet for the first time on March 30th, is limited to determining matters such as which goods are assumed to be destined to remain in Northern Ireland rather than exported to the EU. But the protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland will have to follow the EU customs code, which requires information and checks on goods coming from Great Britain.Irish Sea borderPrime minister Boris Johnson has stated a number of times that there will be no checks and no border in the Irish Sea but Mr Gove said the British government was committed to implementing the protocol in full.“We are committed to making sure that the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented in order to underpin the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. And the point is well understood that the joint committee is there to ensure that it is implemented and also to resolve some of the questions over precisely how,” he said.Mr Gove suggested that the next round of talks between Britain and the EU, which is scheduled to start in London next Wednesday, could be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. And he said the government would not publish an economic impact assessment of the free trade deal it is seeking from the EU.“I am personally sceptical of efforts to say that any given impact assessment by a government department is an accurate prediction of the future. As load-bearing devices go, they are perhaps not the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views about what the economic consequences of a course of action might be,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Why would they not pay for the BBC?”Sir David was speaking at a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee where his policy director, Clare Sumner, claimed that 21 million households pay for a television licence out of choice.“Seventy-five per cent do it by Direct Debit. It’s an absolutely frictionless service. And that’s because they want to pay the TV licence, because they recognise what they get from it,” Ms Sumner said.But she was pulled up by Steve Brine, Tory MP for Winchester, who asked her: “What is the evidence for that statement? The reason they sign up for Direct Debit and pay is because it’s enforceable by law with a penalty of imprisonment if they don’t.”Sumner replied that “evidence suggests people really value our programmes and understand that’s a universal service and want to pay the TV licence,” and said the views of those who object to paying the licence fee should not be given too much credence. “We have got to be careful not to just look at this through the lens of one group of people,” she said.Asked if over-75s will begin to receive letters from licence fee enforcement, threatening prosecution if they do not pay up, Ms Sumner replied that such letters come “the place where we are going to start is very sympathetic and empathetic communication”Lord Hall, the BBC director-general, also appeared before the committee. Its new chairman, Tory MP Julian Knight, showed the executives a threatening letter that one of his constituents had received from licence fee enforcement, warning that they could face prosecution.Sumner said such letters are “not the place where we start” and that over-75s would first receive “sympathetic and empathetic communication”.However, when pressed, Lord Hall admitted that the elderly may find themselves in court over non-payment.Asked by committee member John Nicolson, of the SNP: “If old people can’t or won’t pay, are you really prepared to take 80- and 90-year-olds to court?” Lord Hall replied: “It’s conceivable, but we don’t want to get there,”At the end of the session, Sir David clashed with the committee over the impending announcement of the new director-general, who will replace Lord Hall in the summer.Mr Knight requested that the chosen candidate appear before the committee in a “pre-appointment hearing”, but Sir David said the appointment is “a matter for the board of the BBC” and should be made without political interference.Sir David’s term as chairman ends in January next year, and he has not ruled out reapplying for another four-year term. However, the chairman is appointed by the Government, and Downing Street has made clear that it wants a Tory sympathiser in the post.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2020/03/12/TELEMMGLPICT000227049103_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzEtXRB0DXuIn2fl79S5BHU68ZLc4tf4tWlCSM-3sI_E.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"farewell prince harry wokest royal","story":"I suppose we’ve known all along, really. If there was a Royal Family special of Mastermind, you probably wouldn’t put Prince Harry on first.The big clue was in 2005. Long forgotten now, but it was the year the Prince, albeit only 20 years old, decided to wear a Nazi outfit to a fancy dress party. What was he thinking, many wondered. Nothing, of course. That’s the problem...This week however, he has done something truly exceptional, by falling victim to a phone hoax. If you haven’t heard it yet, you’re in for a treat. A prankster duo pretended to be Greta Thunberg and her father, and astonishingly Harry took their word for it and ulged intimate details of his personal life.The obvious question is why, even if it had been Greta and her Dad on the other end of the line, did he think this was a good idea? But on he went. Some of the worst snippets were political - Trump has “blood on his hands”, claimed Prince Harry, before encouraging (Fake) Thunberg Junior “to be doing extreme things.”As if that wasn’t bizarre enough, he then suggested that he could help broker an arranged marriage between Greta and Prince George, as well as trying to help her transport penguins. “I do have a man who deals with the North Pole”, he reassured her, Tony-Soprano style.On the one hand, you could say this call is Harry’s greatest public service to date - as it served to distract the nation from thoughts of sore throats and burning eyes (yes, that is a symptom of coronavirus). On the other, wow. Many of us were left speechless as to the utter stupidity of it all.A few days ago, I confess I had actually been feeling sorry for Harry. Maybe the media had been too harsh, I thought to myself. But this was validation of sorts, confirming all our suspicions that he is the wokest royal of them all, and doing the right thing by stepping away. He is unsuited to this job - too opinionated, tempestuous and confused - and frankly in desperate need of a holiday.And when I say a holiday I do not mean one in which he frequents the red carpets, bleating on about climate change. This call was a cry from a man who needs a break. Who’s angry with the pressure of being a royal, and simply needs to quarantine himself - as we all shall be doing now - except this shall be an “opinion quarantine”.Oh I shall miss this Prince of Penguins. He has been entertaining, at least.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleCoronavirus latest news: Canadian PM Justin Trudeau\u0026#39s wife tests positive while sport in turmoilPolitics latest news: Coronavirus forces 11 MPs to self-isolate amid growing calls for Parliament to close to visitorsWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?French surgeon who may have raped and abused 349 children stands trial in country\u0026#39s \u0026#39worst paedophile case\u0026#39 Comment: Don\u0026#39t be surprised if this virus delays BrexitThe inside story of the British mother who went to the corner shop and disappeared without a traceComment: It\u0026#39s time to bring our planning system into the 21st century\u0026#39Coronavirus - the world in lockdown\u0026#39: How the world\u0026#39s newspapers are reacting to Covid-19 crisisFrom Tom Hanks to Mikel Arteta, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansEx-Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning freed from jailUS launches airstrikes in Iraq after female reservist named as first Briton killed in combat fighting ISFive Oxford students diagnosed with coronavirus, as universities take drastic action to prevent outbreaksTop of the popes: Pope Francis is a hit with young CatholicsCressida Dick faces fresh demands to resign after report into Carl Beech blundersOperation Midland: Damning report says Met failed to learn from its mistakes\u0026#39Laddish\u0026#39 behaviour so bad that one university abandoned lectures, academics revealGrowing number of European countries shut schools to curb spread of coronavirus Coronavirus delay phase: How it will affect schools, the elderly and events in the UKBBC is complicit in promoting misogyny in rap music, Radio 1 DJ claims We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"global response coronavirus shows nation state back","story":"The Prime Minister of Jamaica is getting worried about Brits flying into his country. Two of them, he said yesterday, have already brought the coronavirus and he might consider a travel ban. The public reaction to his announcement was one of outrage. Consider a ban? What’s to consider? The Brits have the lurgy, so stop them arriving: put country first. Donald Trump made a similar point and, typically, was lambasted for it. But look around, and we see a lot of leaders behaving in the same way.From Brussels, Guy Verhofstadt reached for the moral high ground by telling Trump to focus on American healthcare and not a travel ban for Europeans. But how much European solidarity is on display right now? The Italians are facing their worst peacetime crisis, but Angela Merkel has decreed that Germany’s supply of medical protective equipment is not for export. Her government stopped shipments of masks to Austria, Hungary and Switzerland. So much for the sanctity of the single market.Christine Lagarde, now head of the European Central Bank, doesn’t even pretend to be willing to help Italians whose government bonds come under pressure: not her job, she said yesterday. Her remarks sent Italian government interest rates soaring. It’s as if the world is learning a new EU motto: in discrimine, stas solus. When crisis strikes, you’re on your own. But not completely alone. China has dispatched a team of medical experts — along with masks and ventilators — to Italy, in what seems to be a kind of virus diplomacy.The coronavirus is testing global alliances, with revealing results. It turns out that, when a pandemic strikes, countries react like people do: they stockpile. Clinical facemasks might not be the most effective tool against the virus but Ms Merkel still wants to make sure that Germany has enough of them before she’ll allow any to make their way to Vienna. It’s not quite logical, but it’s very human. One of the many questions coronavirus has raised is just how exposed importers are to these impulses.For some time now, British officials have been working on a no-deal Brexit, and gameplanning various scenarios where global supply chains choke up. In theory, there ought to be no problem at all: why, for example, should France suddenly decide to quarantine pets that Brits bring to Paris? But in practise, politics might throw up complications. For those involved in the no-deal planning, it’s been an eye-opener to find out what Britain doesn’t make anymore, and what we need to stockpile. The exercise seems a little less theoretical now.The feeling in No10 is that such planning will become the new normal, and will occupy government long after the virus is under control. Some see coronavirus as a drill for how to handle the next pandemic. It’s lucky that the last one, swine flu, was so mild: about one in 10 people around the world are understood to have ended up infected. Covid-19 is a nastier pandemic, but not an especially deadly one. A virus as contagious as swine flu and as lethal as Spanish flu could pose a bigger risk to a country than war.Defending the realm will, from now on, mean defending it from the next pandemic. This means making hard-headed assumptions about who to rely on. If Austria was attacked by Russia, then its Nato allies would — in theory — unite in its defence. But with a virus, it’s different: the United States has just closed its borders to 20 of its 28 Nato allies. Trump spoke about banning their imports, too. Austria closed its border with Italy earlier in the week and the Czech Republic closed its border with Austria yesterday. A nation’s instinct is to close ranks.For years, now, the nation state has been making a comeback in Europe. The Schengen borderless idea was conceived when global migration was a fraction of what it is today. Borders are seen as effective tools in handling migration, managing economies and looking after the nation state. Brexit was part of this trend, forcing Britain to confront pretty difficult questions at an early stage.Globalisation, which has brought so many benefits, was being pushed into reverse before the virus struck — assailed by trade protectionists, climate warriors and economic nationalists. Coronavirus might finally kill the hyper-globalisation of the last two decades, making companies paranoid about imports. The average car, for example, has about 25,000 parts brought in from hundreds of different companies. One analysis for Toyota identified 2,200 suppliers for every vehicle rolling off its production line. Doing it this way makes it cheaper, but it may soon come to be seen as insanely risky.Trump has spent years saying America was being ripped off by its trading partners. As so often, his critics ended up copying his analysis: every would-be presidential candidate who stood for the Democrat nomination was just as hawkish on China. Dependence on Beijing — especially for medicine and its components — can now be seen as a security risk, a potential casualty of the next pandemic. World trade hasn’t grown for many months and is unlikely to recover soon, given how many world leaders realise how vulnerable their economies are to global supply chains.When the virus dies down, we can expect British manufacturers to make this point: that it’s time to buy British. It might not be cheaper, but it might be more reliable. An entrepreneurial tool producer in Northern Ireland pointed out last month that half of British machine tools are now bought from China, so wouldn’t it be safer to have them shipped over from Belfast? A few months ago, this might have been seen as the protectionist cry of a Little Britain. Now, it could be seen as a sensible precaution.The advice given to ministers is that we’re still at the beginning of all this, that the number of daily infections will probably keep rising until June. Some in government fear that the supposed worst-case scenario — 100,000 deaths — is looking more like a base scenario. It might never come close to this, but the instinct in government is to prepare for the worst.What is for sure is that the old assumptions about globalisation have gone, never to return.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Here is a round-up of the new information and advice outlined by the government. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said the actual number of people infected in the UK at the moment is likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000 and the UK risk level has been raised to high.Britain is currently around four weeks behind Italy, he said, which has nearly 12,500 confirmed cases and more than 630 deaths. Eight people have died in Britain and the government said there were more than 20 people still battling the virus in intensive care units. The majority of those people acquired the virus from people who had no known contact with the virus.The epidemic is now in the delay phase rather than containment and so nobody will now be tested for coronavirus unless they are already in hospital and show symptoms. Contact tracing will also no longer be taking place and there will no longer be geographical limits on who gets tested as experts said it was no longer relevant.Sir Patrick said he hoped Britain could change the current trajectory of disease and ‘deflect’ a huge spike in cases as has been seen in Italy.The virus is expected to peak in 10 to 14 weeks when 95 per cent of the infections are expected to take place. It means that most people will contract the virus between late May and late June. Anyone who develops even mild symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature should now stay at home for seven days, keep two metres away from others and, if possible, sleep alone. People with any symptoms should not to go to work, school, or public areas, use public transport or taxis, or even go for a walk.They should only contact NHS 111 if they get worse after a week.  Those who are self-isolating already because they have been to an at-risk country or in contact with someone who has, should also not contact NHS 111 unless their condition deteriorates. The advice recommends asking friends, family and employers for their assistance with what they require to remain at home for seven days.Explaining the advice to self-isolate for seven days, the Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged it was ‘something which will interfere with their lives and interfere with their work and their social life in quite significant ways’.The Prime Minister added: “There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months.”Families of those who are self-isolating are also expected to be told to stay at home in coming months.Mr Johnson said: “If someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. I want to signal now that this is coming down the track.”Currently anyone living with a person in quarantine should use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household if possible which should be cleaned after each use. Advice also states to use separate crockery and a dishwasher if possible, but if not, to wash dishes as normal with hot water but with a separate tea towel.Personal waste, including used tissues and disposable cleaning cloths, should be stored securely within two disposable rubbish bags and kept separate from the rest of a person\u0027s household waste.It should be kept aside for at least 72 hours before being put in the external household waste bin, the advice states.The government is hoping to delay the amount of time people are forced to stay at home until the epidemic is nearing its peak, in case ‘enthusiasm starts to flag.’Over 70s have been advised not to go on cruises and schools have also been warned not to take children on overseas trips. But the government said that widely restricting travel would have a minimal impact on delaying the spread of coronavirus.Sir Patrick said that even stopping flights from infected areas by 95 per cent would only delay the epidemic by ‘a day or two’.He said the evidence had borne that out and added that it is now ‘too late’ to be implementing such a measure and added that airport screening measures were unhelpful as they did not stop sick people entering the country.The government said that in the coming weeks, it will be introducing further social distancing measures for older and vulnerable people, asking them to self-isolate regardless of symptoms.The government is hoping that if they time isolation measures correctly, the vulnerable and elderly will emerge from their homes after herd immunity has built up and will consequently be more protected. Public health experts are also concerned that shutting older people off for long periods of time could leave them socially isolated and lonely.In a message to the elderly, Mr Johnson said that although the disease was ‘particularly dangerous for them, the vast majority would experience ‘a mild-to-moderate illness’.The Prime Minister said millions of people would need to be mobilised in the coming months to help support each other.“I know that many people will be very worried,” he added . “We will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other.” But he said the most dangerous period is some weeks away and the Department of Health said it would clearly announce when we ask the public to move to this next stage.Mass events such as sporting fixtures will not be banned for now.However, the language used by Mr Johnson and his advisors suggests that the introduction of such measures could be a matter of when rather than if.“We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures,” the Prime Minister said.“But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services.Sir Patrick, the Chief Scientific Advisor, explained that most virus carriers are likely to infect, on average, two or three others and that this is far more probable in an enclosed environment, such as a home or pub, than at a football stadium.Nevertheless, the decision to keep the option of closures “up our sleeve”, as Mr Johnson put it, will leave both sports administrators and fans in limbo.The final two months of the Premier League, the three-day Grand National meeting at Aintree in April, plus home cricket series against the West Indies, Australia and Pakistan and a plethora of summer music festivals, are just some of the major events that could be affected.On the day Ireland, France and Spain announced they would close all schools in an effort to fight the virus, the government was under pressure from some to follow suit.But officials are worried that suddenly putting tens of thousands of children in need of parental childcare could seriously damage already fragile staffing levels in key public services.The clear message that schools should only close if specifically advised follows a spate of unilateral temporary closures in recent weeks.“We are not, repeat not, closing schools now,” said the Prime Minister.“The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time.”He added, however: “We are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads.”Prof Whitty said closing schools in order to protect children is not justified by the science as, so far, they do not seem to be at risk of death from coronavirus.“Our view is not that they do get infected, but they seem to have a much milder disease in general, he said.“Closing schools has a big knock-on effect and has to be justified.”For most people who get infected with coronavirus, the illness will be a relatively short affair - a handful of days.Sir Patrick said the majority will live with a repetitive cough or slight fever, or both, for approximately three days after first experiencing symptoms and then recover.However, more vulnerable patients will enter a second phase when their immune response overreacts to the infection, potentially threatening the functioning of key organs.This can manifest itself as shortness of breath.Mr Johnson acknowledged that even though Covid-19 is particularly dangerous for older people, even for the majority of them the symptoms will be mild.Professor Whitty sought to remind people that even those who do not feel too dreadful can spread the disease:“People with really quite mild symptoms can spread this virus to a lot of people.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cressida dick faces fresh demands resign report carl beech blunders","story":"Dame Cressida Dick is under mounting pressure after a damning report accused Scotland Yard of sitting on its hands and ignoring the catalogue of blunders exposed during its disastrous Operation Midland investigation.Inspectors, who were ordered in by Priti Patel, found that senior officers were more interested in protecting the reputation of the force than learning from one of the Met\u0027s most embarrassing episodes for decades.Critics said the Met Commissioner\u0027s position is now in real jeopardy after the report by Her Majesty\u0027s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire \u0026amp Rescue Services (HMICFRS) accused her force of waiting three years before acting on a series of urgent recommendations.Scotland Yard spent more than £5 million and traduced the reputations of a string of high profile public figures while investigating a series of fantastical allegations by the fantasist and paedophile Carl Beech. After the investigation collapsed in 2016, Sir Richard Henriques, a retired High Court judge, carried out a review in which he identified 43 mistakes by the Met and made 25 urgent recommendations.But the HMICFRS found the force, which Dame Cressida has headed up since April 2017, only began to act on the bulk of the recommendations last year following the appointment of Ms Patel as Home Secretary.Harvey Proctor, the former Tory MP, who was one of those wrongly investigated for child abuse and murder, described the report as devastating and accused Dame Cressida of overseeing a cover up.One very well placed source involved in the HMICFRS inquiry added : This report puts Cressida Dick\u0027s position in serious jeopardy. This shows serious failings. The fact is between October 2016 when the Henriques report was submitted and late 2019, the Met did nothing to implement these recommendations. Cressida was appointed commissioner in April 2017 and that speaks volumes.Another source said: The Met, under Cressida Dick, has never fully owned up to its mistakes. It has all been smoke and mirrors as they desperately try to avoid taking responsibility for what went wrong.No officer has ever been held to account for what went wrong during Operation Midland, with Steve Rodhouse, who was in overall charge allowed to take up a £250,000 a year job with the National Crime Agency.Other senior officers involved were allowed to retire on full pensions or were in some cases promoted.Scotland Yard took three years to publish the unredacted Henriques report, with HMICFRS claiming senior officers were more interested in restricting access than learning lessons from it.That conclusion was backed up by a senior detective who told inspectors the Henriques report was one of the most secret learning experiences the Met has had.It was only in October last year that the force set up the Operation Larimer team in order to ensure the robust implementation of the Henriques recommendations.But the HMICFRS report said: Some of what the Larimar team is now doing could and should have been done when the Henriques report was first published in 201617.HM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said: We were pretty underwhelmed by the Met\u0027s response for the first three years.It\u0027s pretty clear generally learning lessons from the Henriques report doesn\u0027t seem to have been the top priority and it should\u0027ve been.A Whitehall source said: It is only because of pressure from the Home Office in recent months that the Met have finally started to act.In a statement yesterday, Ms Patel said: “It is essential that lessons are learned so that the failings in Operation Midland are not repeated.“That is why I requested this report - and I will continue to seek assurances from the politan Police that it is acting on the Inspectorate’s findings.Commissioner Cressida Dick said: “Operation Midland had a terrible impact on those who were falsely accused by Carl Beech. The previous Commissioner and I have apologised to them and I repeat that apology again today.“The MPS took Sir Richard’s report extremely seriously and quickly recognised that many of the recommendations would affect policing nationwide.“However, the Inspectorate believe more work should have been done between the initial response and our current renewed focus following the conviction of Carl Beech and the conclusion of the IOPC investigation.“In October 2019 I set up Operation Larimar, led by a senior officer reporting directly to me. This structure is ensuring we make ongoing progress and continue the significant momentum in our current work.“The Inspectorate’s recognition of the comprehensive work underway should reassure everyone we have learnt the lessons from Operation Midland and the same mistakes would not be repeated.”But Mr Proctor said Dame Cressida must now consider her position.He said: Police officers who mess up and get things so seriously wrong including the present Commissioner should bear a personal responsibility for their wrong doing. They should not be promoted, pensioned off. Ennobled and enriched. That is not the correct lesson that should be learnt from this dreadful scandal - the worst in living memory of the police.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/09/TELEMMGLPICT000227360629_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dont surprised virus delays brexit","story":"\u0026#39One more week like this and the S\u0026ampP 500 will have given up all the gains made during Donald Trump\u0026#39s presidency\u0026#39As market chaos points to a global recession, calls will grow to extend the transition periodFinally it gets serious. Even with the explosion of deaths in Northern Italy and the shock and awe economic response announced by the UK Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his Budget this week, it was still possible to dismiss the coronavirus as a passing panic that by early summer might have burnt itself out.But Donald Trump’s clumsy and apparently spiteful response in banning European passenger flights takes things to a whole new level and pretty much guarantees that the economic consequences transmogrify from a pronounced slowdown into a global recession.That in any case is what the markets are now signalling. The waves from this virus just keep on growing, threatening wide-ranging geopolitical consequences on top of the social, economic and financial effects.Could Covid-19 yet derail Brexit along with everything else? As we saw from this week’s Budget, this is a Government determined to keep its promises, and primary among them is that Britain leaves Europe’s single market and customs union at the end of this year come what may, with or without a free trade deal.Up until now, this has seemed the right negotiating stance, but is it still credible in light of the gathering economic storm clouds of the Covid-19 outbreak?It might be possible partially to cushion the UK economy from the shock of the virus, as Mr Sunak tried to in this week’s Budget, but to pile the additional challenge of a no-deal exit from the single market on top would be quite an ask.Coronavirus cases in LondonFace to face meetings could soon become impossible, making progress on a free trade deal hard to achieve, and with bigger fish to fry, the Europeans might in any case simply decide unilaterally to terminate the talks until the coronavirus crisis subsides.In such circumstances, would the UK simply plough ahead regardless or, with force majeure as an excuse, extend the transition? There are two ways of looking at this choice.One is that preparations for a no-deal Brexit mean that, by chance, the UK economy is in remarkably good shape to withstand any prolonged international quarantine. We are already braced for much tougher border controls.What is more, if the virus is still raging as we approach the end of the transition, a little extra economic harm from falling out of the single market without a free trade agreement is scarcely going to matter very much. It’ll all get lost in the wash.In any case, if the virus causes the European economy to collapse into recession, sparking renewed crisis in the single currency, Brussels won’t want to pile on the agony by risking an acrimonious trade rupture with the UK. Brexit will become seen as a comparatively trivial matter to be settled in a needs-must, least-damage manner. They’ll cut a deal to avoid further nuisance.Yet the other way of looking at the choice is that there would be no face to lose in agreeing an extension if the world is by then still gripped by the natural disaster of a killer disease. In the scale of things, a minor delay to Brexit would be of no significance.Already, then, the crisis is raising major political issues on top of the more immediate concerns around public health and the economy. For all political leaders, the virus is a potentially existential threat. Get the response wrong, and citizens will find ways of punishing them just as severely as if they have failed on the economy, or for that matter Brexit.If infection rates and deaths begin to spiral out of control, Boris Johnson will be in some difficulty, even with his newly won “stonking” majority, having decided not to go for the full scale lockdown imposed elsewhere.Mindful of the criticism George W Bush was subjected to for his handling of Hurricane Katrina, meanwhile, President Trump is said to have become completely obsessed with the politics of what could be his own Katrina moment.It has to be said that so far his approach to the crisis has been less than exemplary. A combination of a mishandled public response, a plunging stock market, a contracting economy and a Democratic Party that seems finally to have come to its senses in rejecting “mad Bernie” as its presidential nominee, could easily sink Trump’s chances of re-election for a second term.For a President who measures his own success against the yardstick of stock market performance things are looking grim. One more week like this, and the S\u0026ampP 500 will have given up all the gains made during his presidency.Catastrophes come in many different forms the coronavirus pandemic is obviously a very different kind of economic event from the financial crisis a decade ago – the disease an act of God and the latter wholly man-made. Yet the two may turn out to be not so dissimilar in their seminal repercussions.Such events change the world, just when you are least expecting it.

It is about gaps in students’ knowledge from which they might suffer long-term disadvantages,” Mr Hillman saidThousands of\u0026nbsprequests for compensation and complaints have been logged to universities across the UK, the figures show.\u0026nbspIt comes after students have set up petitions calling for refunds.At King’s College London (KCL),\u0026nbspmore than 500 students had their tuition fees partially refunded because of the strikes. More than £640,000 was awarded to\u0026nbspstudents, ranging from £122 to £4,500 each.\u0026nbspAnd yet in other institutions, only a handful of students were given one-off payments. University College London (UCL) paid out just over £6,000 to eight students after they submitted complaints.Jess, a former UCL master’s student, said she sought compensation\u0026nbspafter she missed out on around\u0026nbsphalf\u0026nbspof her teaching time in her final term but her request was refused.She told The Independent: “The main impact it had was on my stress levels. It meant limited access to academic resources and less chance to see tutors.“This limited what we could confidently study and made me, and others, far more worried about the quality of our work.”The English graduate added: “It also created immense frustration because I’d saved for so long to attend and I essentially missed a big chunk of the MA I’d spent the money on.”UCL said refunding tuition fees in respect of industrial action is not part of its policy. Payments were made to students who complained they were\u0026nbspdisadvantaged without appropriate mitigation.\u0026nbspStudents at other universities, including Loughborough, Roehampton and Essex, did not receive tuition fee refunds but were instead offered “goodwill” payments for cancelled lectures and seminars.Essex University allocated £180 to students who had more than 17 teaching events cancelled during the\u0026nbspaction in 2018. Students who missed out on between one and eight events received just £40.\u0026nbspAnd Sussex University\u0026nbspestablished an ex gratia scheme to provide payments to students that suffered distress from strikes in 2018\u0026nbspand 2019. So far £1.1m has been paid out to thousands of students.\u0026nbspThe University of Edinburgh also set up an opportunity fund, made up from money not spent on salaries during strikes, which provided more than £1m to 4,410 students affected by industrial action.At Kent University, nearly 5,000 final-year students in 2018 were offered Amazon vouchers\u0026nbspafter the university received 500 complaints about disruption.Other universities, which have not offered any payments, said\u0026nbspthey have carried out other actions to mitigate the impact on students – including adjusting coursework and exam timetables.Students demand tuition fee refunds for fresh wave of strikesUniversities brace for compensation claims as 43,000 staff strikeStudents demand tuition fee refunds for planned university strikesSome institutions\u0026nbsphave used the money withheld from striking staff to go towards student mental health support.But many of the universities which responded to the request did not set out how they had minimised\u0026nbspdisruption or how withheld salaries would be spent on students.Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, said: “Students have shown phenomenal support for staff throughout the strikes, and understandably want to hold their institutions to account for the disruption they have faced, so it’s no surprise they are seeking compensation.\u0026nbsp“Students should demand transparency from their institutions on finances and how pay withheld from striking staff is being spent – these are significant sums that should be used for the benefit of students and staff.\u0026nbsp“We would also urge students to put further pressure on vice-chancellors by asking what specific actions they are taking to help end the disputes and avoid any further disruption.”Nicola\u0026nbspDandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), said: “We expect universities and colleges to do all they can to avoid disruption for students, and to minimise the impact of industrial action on their studies.\u0026nbsp“That means that they need to think about how best to make up for missed teaching and make clear to students how they will respond if examinations or assessments are affected.“We require universities and colleges to comply with our regulatory conditions during industrial action as at any other time. That means that they must do all they can to mitigate against the impacts of this action, and keep students informed at every stage.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Students rightly expect to get a good deal for their investment in higher education and in the event that any student was seriously affected by strike action we would expect universities to take appropriate action, which could include compensation.”A spokesperson for Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) employers said: “We understand that missed teaching time is unsettling. The specific approach to putting things right will vary by institution.\u0026nbsp“If students feel their studies have been negatively impacted and alternative arrangements are inadequate, they should complain through their university in the first instance.\u0026nbsp“If students are not satisfied with the response from their university they are able to escalate their complaint to the relevant Ombudsman for their country.\u0026nbsp“In some cases, students may be entitled to a partial refund or financial compensation. This would be where there is evidence of a breach of contract where the university has been unable to put in place reasonable alternative arrangements, for example.”University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those would not be able to happen in time to ensure that the mission could be successful, they said.While those further tests would have been required anyway, the spread of coronavirus compromised the final phase of activities ahead of the launch, the space agencies said.It was unclear whether the coronavirus would have caused the mission to be delayed without those other problems, officials said.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?We have made a difficult but well-weighed decision to postpone the launch to 2022, said\u0026nbspRoscosmos\u0026nbspdirector general Dmitry Rogozin. It is driven primarily by the need to maximise the robustness of all ExoMars systems as well as force majeure circumstances related to exacerbation of the epidemiological situation in Europe which left our experts practically no possibility to proceed with travels to partner industries.I am confident that the steps that we and our European colleagues are taking to ensure mission success will be justified and will unquestionably bring solely positive results for the mission implementation.The mission will now target a launch in 2022. The planets must align correctly for such launches to take place, meaning that the window only opens for around 10 days every two years.Created with Sketch.

And it now has a folding screenThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the South Korean manufacturer’s second folding phone. The first was the Galaxy Fold, which was essentially a tablet that folded in half to be the size of a regular smartphone. Great if you want a tablet that’s pocketable.But the original folding phones of 20 years ago had a different purpose: to offer everything a regular phone did but in a much more pocketable form factor. And that’s what the Z Flip is aiming to do, as well.When it’s folded, the Galaxy Z Flip is the size and shape of – and everyone I’ve shown it to has said this first – a make-up compact. This doesn’t mean it’s only aimed at women, for sure, but it fits any bag or trouser pocket with ease. The shiny, gloss-black finish is highly attractive and also comes in a similarly opulent purple hue. The smooth feel, the manageable size and the curved edges make it highly tactile, something you can roll effortlessly through your fingers. Even the hinge, with the etched-in company name on the end, is pleasing to the touch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOpen the lid and you suddenly have a large-screen phone, the 6.7in screen stretching across the entire inside face. Unlike almost every other smartphone, there’s a raised ridge around the entire display. That’s because although the screen itself is glass – yes, foldable glass! – to protect it, there’s a plastic film stretched tight across the glass and the ridge is what anchors it in place.Run your finger across the display and it mostly doesn’t feel any different to a regular screen. Until you hit the middle. There’s a crease there, which is unmissable to the touch. If light falls on the display, the crease is also visible. As you close the screen, the light coming from the crease is brighter.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

When you’re watching a video, there’s no image distortion as you might imagine. It looks like a regular OLED smartphone screen: sharp, colourful and vibrant.There’s a small screen on the outer case of the phone, next to the dual cameras. This tiny screen shows the time and some other notifications when you tap the little display twice.There’s a fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy Z Flip, situated in the power button positioned on the right edge. It’s fast and accurate.Opening and closing the phone requires a certain dexterity. You can’t flip it violently open like Captain Kirk opening his Communicator. I mean, you can, but it feels dangerous, like the thin phone might snap in two. It wouldn’t, but it’s part of the way you feel you need to handle the Galaxy Z Flip with kid gloves. It’s also not waterproof, as many flagships are these days – and the £1,300 price tag tells you this is a flagship.But the bottom line is this is a very enjoyable phone to use: the pocket fit is just great – it takes time to get used to how little space it takes up. The display is attractive and bigger than an iPhone 11 Pro Max, for instance.Performance is good, with a decent, though not quite top-level, processor ensuring that everything happens fast. The phone feels responsive and powerful.It also has good battery life, running for a full day with ease and charging quickly enough. It is wireless-chargeable and even has Wireless Powershare, where placing another phone against the folded Z Flip will charge the other handset. It works with any wireless-chargeable phone, from any brand or other gadgets such as AirPods Pro or Samsung Galaxy Buds.Cameras are a crucial part of every smartphone and the Galaxy Z Flip has three. On the display there’s a single 10MP lens which peeps out from the display, at the top in the middle. On the outer case there are two 12MP cameras, one wide and one ultra-wide. Other top-flight cameras often feature more than two rear cameras but the two here are perfectly good, just no match for the leaders in this respect, the iPhone 11 Pro and Huawei Mate 30 Pro.You can use the rear cameras for selfies, as well as the inside one. To see what the lens is looking at, you close the phone, double-press the power button and a preview appears on the little external display.This is a fascinating phone, offering something tangibly different from the rest of the phones out there, which are invariably flat slabs of glass and\u0026nbspmetal. It is easy to use and a great deal of fun.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldAfter just a week or so of use, the novelty of being able to put a big-screen phone into a small pocket has not worn off.But there are also compromises. It doesn’t feel as solid as most other phones – though those need to be protected in cases. Samsung has thoughtfully included a two-piece transparent case which clips on to keep the phone scratch-free.Will it last as long as other phones? The hinge is solid and feels like it will be long-lasting. But the display’s protective screen is less hardy and may sustain scratches.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip proves that a folding phone is an enticing prospect and, although there are concerns about durability, this phone largely succeeds.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It had these weird eyes staring out looking to the sides. There’s nothing like this alive today.“It’s just incredible to uncover this new ecological niche we never even knew existed.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government will start a consultation on whether to grant local authorities more powers to tackle the issue. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe announcement came in response to a report issued by the Transport Select Committee in September 2019 which sought to ban the “blight” of pavement parking throughout England. Witnesses had told MPs that in some cases pavement parking caused disabled, vulnerable and elderly people to feel trapped, leaving some “afraid to leave their homes”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A worker makes her way along rows of daffodils, removing any rogue varieties, at Taylors Bulbs in Holbeach, Lincolnshire.

This will look at a variety of options – including giving local authorities extended powers to crack down on this behaviour.”Huw Merriman, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, said there was “much to praise” in the DfT’s announcement, but warned that previous government reviews had not succeeded in improving roadside conditions. “This government has signalled an intent to finally deliver change. We now need a detailed timeframe from the Department for Transport to ensure this happens,” he said.Drive-thru coronavirus test station opens in UK car parkMan shot dead in row over parking spaceHowever, the AA has said that a total ban may have “unintended consequences”, potentially leading to more widespread “parking chaos”.Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said: “We absolutely agree that people who park in an anti-social way should be penalised. Many drivers in narrow streets are tempted to partially park on the\u0026nbsppavement\u0026nbspso emergency services and refuse trucks can pass.”“An outright ban could lead to unintended consequences with\u0026nbspparking\u0026nbspchaos becoming more widespread. A better solution would be for councils to make a street-by-street assessment and where\u0026nbsppavement\u0026nbspparking\u0026nbspcould be allowed it be clearly marked and signed,” he added.

We expect this shortfall to be partly reversed as the specifics of the trading relationship are clarified, hence reducing uncertainty.\u0026nbspBut, working in the other direction, we expect the adverse effect of higher trade barriers to build through our five-year forecast period and beyond.Figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning show that the economy has flat-lined, even before the effects of coronavirus bite.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

DNA results show that the hatchlings were, in fact, reproduced through parthenogenesis!Parthenogenesis is unusual, with the first cases recorded in 2006 in the UK at both London and Chester Zoo, according to Scientific American.The publication explained how it works, saying: In parthenogenesis, the mother\u0027s half-set of chromosomes doubles up to generate the full complement. Hence, the offspring derives all its genes from the mother, but they are not a duplicate of her genome.They reported that only 0.1 percent of all vertebrate are able to reproduce asexually.Komodo dragon attacks tourist in Indonesia national parkExplaining how parthenogenesis developed, the zoo wrote that the process developed in the wild due to their isolated nature.In the wild,\u0026nbspKomodo\u0026nbspdragons mainly live isolated and often become violent when approached, which has allowed these animals to evolve to reproduce both sexually and parthenogenetically.Announcing the news, the zoo playfully posted: Our Komodo Dragon hatchling DNA results are in!*Maury Voice* Kadal, you are NOT the father!Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat. Miriam Margolyes on The One Show.”The Sex Clinic, Esther: “I’d say my sex le is very spontaneous.”Lonely, desolate, unfulfilled, messy, abandoned, solitary, forlorn, a cry for help and all those other things Vanessa Feltz once scrawled on a Celebrity Big Brother table.And why hasn’t Sharon ­listened to Denny’s phone message incriminating Ian  It really would speed this storyline along a bit.WORLD heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury could quite easily have become the most intimidating oaf on the planet.The fact he didn’t and is a surprisingly endearing figure owes something to his continued attachment to home town Morecambe, in Lancashire, and its rubbish disposal unit, which, Tyson explained last Thursday, he faithfully visits “twice a week”, while also taking the car for a mini-valet on a Monday and: “Shaving me head.”It’s a devotion dwarfed only by Tyson’s love for his five children, three of whom are called Prince, and heroic we, Paris, who endures his mood swings and singing with a resolve that would put a few of his opponents to shame.All of which made him the perfect subject for ITV’s fly-on-the-wall documentary Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, a three-part dream of a series which came to a thrilling and touching conclusion last Thursday, with footage of his win over Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas.Victory was followed by a slightly baffling chorus of American Pie before Tyson grabbed the first available phone to speak to his terrying dad, John, who’d been forced to watch the fight back in England, for GBH-related reasons.Only one question seemed to matter by that stage. “Did I look good on the telly, Dad ” Outstanding, Tyson, son.

Or fully grown adults wearing replica football shirts  Or better still, bottled water — the real environmental scandal of our time.But cigarettes aside, Rishi Sunak’s first Budget as Chancellor ticked all the right boxes.In parts, quite a lot of parts, it sounded like a moderate Labour Budget.By which I don’t mean the kind of thing the wretched John McDonnell might have delivered — free unicorns for the poor and all people who earn money to be shot etc.I mean the Labour Party when it had an ounce of common sense.There was good populist stuff in there, especially the pledge to mend the potholes.I can’t be the only bloke who has had to fork out for a new tyre because of a hole in the road the size of the Isle of Wight.A lot of the Budget was, reasonably enough, directed at battling coronavirus.Help for businesses and sick pay for those who miss work and wouldn’t normally get it. And pretty much a blank cheque for the NHS.All of this was necessary, but it meant that much of the good stuff in the Budget got overlooked a little.This Government was brought to power by the votes of former Labour supporters in the North andthe North East.Parts of the country which, in the past, Conservative governments have left to rot.It took a lot to get those people to vote Tory — and they won’t do it againthere isn’t substantial investment in infra-structure for our northern towns and cities.The Chancellor addressed this. He announced a massive increase in capital spending.Some £billion will be spent investing in infrastructure.That’s the highest level in real terms since Clement Attlee’s excellent Labour government  years ago.We don’t know where it’s all going yet.If it gets swallowed up by the largely daft HS rail scheme, that will be a mistake.Sunak, though, knows the North East. He knows we need big investment to make these places attractive to business and to those who might move there.He knows too that we need to disperse high-paying jobs to the regions.So there’s going to be a new economic campus in the North and , civil service jobs moved from the capital to the regions.Excellent. This is what Boris Johnson means by “levelling up”.For too long London and the rest of the UK have been effectively two separate countries.So, the cigarettes apart, this was a fine Budget which should reassure those new Conservative voters that this government WILL look after their interests.And the latest opinion polls  Tories on  per cent.Labour way down on even its pathetic election share.So far, Boris and Rishi have not put a foot wrong.But here in the North we’re still watching, gentle-men. And hoping this is just a start.Fiddling with the constitution to ensure that he can remain president until . . . .That means he will have been president of his country longer than that chap he quite admires, Joseph Stalin.And will be  years old when he finally stands down.If he does stand down then.Unless it was with a qualying clause such as “hasn’t got very much”.The poor bloke has presided over a string of botched initiatives as a minister.I wouldn’t wish to be rude, but my suspicion is that a plaster garden ornament – a gnome with a fishing pole, or a heron – would do the job better.The hoarding of non-perishable food items, such as crates of Jack Daniel’s and tinned pies. You can’t be too careful.I suppose I also understand people buying hand sanitiser – asit had suddenly occurred to them that having clean hands might be a good idea.But what’s with the toilet paper  Is that really your first thought at a time of crisis  And the amount of the stuff people are buying!Lordy,that’s how many rolls they need, I think Covid- is the least of their worries.It’ll be the same when Armageddon comes, when the nukes are flying hither and thither.All the supermarkets will be stripped of vanilla-scented soft ply.“If I’m going to meet my maker, I will do so with a very clean arse.”They usually keep a bucket, or something, of the stuff outside the front door. It’s blessed by the monks, I think.Anyway they’ve discontinued the practice for a while to prevent the spread of this singularly annoying virus.And people are saying – well,it’s holy, it can’t possibly be tainted with flu virus, can it There’s one born every minute, isn’t there THE Labour Party is continuing its long and exciting journey from being a government in waiting to being a small organisation for the terminally deranged.Their latest act has been to suspend the last remaining sane member of the party, the excellent Trevor Phillips.He’s a lelong campaigner against racism – but has been suspended for being Islamophobic.He has never been remotely Islamophobic.If Phillips had been leading the Labour Party at the last election, we’d probably have a Labour government now.Instead, it was led by a rabble of anti-Semitic, far-left loons obsessed with identity politics and Palestine.I’M still not sure we’re doing the proper coronavirus checks on people flying back from their bloody skiing holidays in Italy.There are reports of many passengers receiving no checks at all.Surely anyone who has been to Italy should have been advised long ago to self-isolate – and inform the authoritiesthey feel poorly.I think we will regret not having done this.Well done British Airways for cancelling all flights to Italy.

Our economy, firms and workers need a short-term bailout to survive it.Brexit may entail another brief rocky patch which needs further stimulus.And the Tories also have to fulfil on their long-term mission, Boris Johnson’s revolutionary aim to spread ­London’s opportunities out to the regions.All that — “security today, prosperity tomorrow”, Mr Sunak called it — will cost hundreds of billions which, without raising taxes yet further, he must borrow.But there has never been a better time, with interest rates rooted to the floor.And we would trust a Tory Chancellor to do so more than any hard-left Labour regime hostile to capitalism itself.Britain seems to agree. The re-elected Tories are at  per cent in polls — but most of their voters do want far more spent on our threadbare public services.There were several standout ideas as Mr Sunak delivered his first Budget with remarkable poise and passion for a man less than a month into his job.The £billion to mitigate the Covid- pandemic should be an immense relief to small firms and workers, especially the year-long rates holiday and newly relaxed sick pay rules.And whatever the NHS needs it will get, the Chancellor said, starting with a £billion emergency fund.“It will be tough, but we will recover,” he added.It was stark, but reassuring.Then came tax cuts and freezes galore, music to the ears of working people.A National Insurance threshold rise worth £, the tampon tax axed, duties frozen on booze and fuel, a ­victory for The Sun.The planned infrastructure spend is vast: £billion over five years including £billion on roads, new rail ­stations, £billion on affordable social housing and £billion to remove Grenfell-style cladding from all high-rises.New roads and cheaper petrol won’t please eco campaigners, but there was also major investment in electric vehicle grants and charging, a plastic packaging tax and a big tree-planting programme.Labour might have had the wit to respond by saying Mr Sunak had simply stolen their clothes. Instead Corbyn droned idiotically on about austerity as his backbenchers prayed for the end.We wonder what ground his successor can fight on, with the Tories launching the biggest spending spree in  years.Yes, there is a risk it will end in tears.

The flu kills many more ­people each day.We get up early to go skiing. My son’s best friend and his family come too. We have a lot of fun.Spring is in the air and the virus is far from our thoughts. But on the news, they report that the numbers are starting to spike.There are rumours about the red zone [the areas most at risk which have been put into quarantine] being extended to Milan. How could you lock down Italy’s business capital To consider economic disruption this big, the authorities must be deeply ­worried. Unease begins to stir.They have extended the red zone to Milan — and our province of Alessandria has been placed inside it.My husband can no longer go to work in Genoa and I cannot leave for the airport — any thoughts of ­heading back to the UK are out.The numbers are really on the rise. An intensive care doctor from Lombardy interviewed on the news said all the dferent medical ­specialities — gynaecologists, neurosurgeons, ­endocrinologists — are now working in intensive care.He complains that away from the epicentres, people are too complacent and that we could reach the stage where the elderly are left to die.Another person says the sound of sirens in Piacenza is relentless.I think about my asthma and ­thyroid problems. Would this virus be a problem for me My husband heads to Genoa. He needs to collect files from the office so he can work from home. He expects to encounter roadblocks but passes unchecked.When he arrives, a colleague starts screaming at him, saying he should not have come.To reassure his staff, the boss quarantines my husband in a room on his own all day and gives him a stack of paperwork to ­complete in the event the police stop him. They don’t. I go to the ­village as we are out of milk.The normally friendly newsagent barely utters a word. Maybe she thinks my husband is still working in Milan and doesn’t know he changed jobs.The lady in the grocer’s askshe’s still based there. She breathes a sigh of relief when I set her straight. The number of cases is now ,-plus. They’ve tripled since Friday. Friends and family back home are emailing, askingwe are OK.The edict not to leave the province has been ramped up — don’t leave your village or town. You will need special permission to travel to the ­supermarket  minutes away.In the village shop, everything costs double and people are wearing masks. On Monday police came and read them the riot act. Signs went up saying just three customers at a time — and we have to keep a metre’s distance from each other.Government messages are doing the rounds, urging people not to leave their homes. Those who do are putting the elderly at risk. The ­government jokes that it’s the only time you can do your bit for the country by staying in your pyjamas.The kids pressed their noses to the window as the neighbours and their children walked past our house and cried when I wouldn’t let them out.It feels so strange not to be able to talk to those passing by. My sons’ teachers keep sending homework through on WhatsApp which I need to supervise. It feels like I’m running a school.Another doctor from Lombardy is on the news. He says we have now reached the dreaded stage where the elderly are being left to die. It feels like I’m living in a nightmare.I go back to making a chocolate cake. I wonder whether it will be the last one I eat. I have developed a dry cough and I feel feverish.A mum from school forwards a WhatsApp message suggesting we all make rainbow banners saying “Everything will be OK”. Too many of the ­younger children are stressed and could do with reassurance.I talk to my sister who is a doctor in the UK. She is worried by how little they seem to be doing to ­prepare. I tell her I think they’re sleepwalking into a nightmare.On the evening news, Lombardy’s governor says they may not be able to guarantee hospital care ten days from now. I can’t believe it.They are shutting all the shops now, only letting them open every few days for customers to restock.My husband wants to go to Milan to withdraw money as he is worried the government may freeze bank accounts. But whatthey detain him and he can’t come home  AndI get sick, who will care for our children My thoughts are running away with me but I wish I’d started to think about all of this a lot earlier. My cough is getting worse.It is a beautul day here in Piedmont and my cough seems to have disappeared. I’ve got cabin fever so I sit in the garden and enjoy the sun.Less than two hours away they are struggling to cope with a full-on emergency and people are being left to die. I almost feel asI am sunbathing on the deck of the Titanic.Bruno, my eldest, is being very dficult. He moans the whole time and is becoming angry and aggressive with his younger brother. He complains that it has been days since he last saw someone his age.The other night Bruno asked meI was going to die. I am trying not to express too much anxiety in front of the children.The TV news is reporting that the health service in Lombardy is almost at saturation point. If they reach capacity, they will no longer be able to treat the sick.The head of the Veneto region expects to have million cases by the middle of April. The health service there would collapse.Doctors from Lombardy are describing how patients are dying alone. There is no relative to hold their hand as all family members are banned from going inside the hospital.After lunch, I have to drive through the village to collect some school books. It’s deserted and the car park is empty.I spot two old ladies going for a stroll, respecting the one-metre ­distance rule by walking one behind the other. They have a conversation by shouting back and forth.It’s the only thing that has made me smile in a long time.The government is talking about shutting all industrial production. Only pharmacies and food shops would stay open.We are told that the next  days will be crucial in establishing whether they have had any success in slowing the spread of the virus. I go back into the garden. The spring sun is still shining and the birds are singing. Yet again, I fight the sensation that this is all just a nightmare.They have shut down the country — bars, all stores except food shops, most factories and, it seems, banks .My husband went to the village and the only place open was the baker’s. The morning cappuccino is almost a religious rite here and a few puzzled elderly locals were hanging around outside.“Not even in the war did they close the bars,” said one.My eldest asked methere would be anyone left in the world once the virus took hold. My ­youngest is wondering what effect it would have on young children.I assured him he would be fine but he didn’t seem convinced.I realise that I have never thought about death so much. I think about it before I go to bed, in the middle of the night, when I wake up.Over the past week when I’ve gone on Twitter, people’s concerns about the banal problems of daily le have made me think of Simon Pegg in Shaun Of The Dead when he fails to notice the beginning of the zombie apocalypse.But now it seems people are finally starting to understand that our nightmare could be coming to them soon.According to the news, the number of deaths in the last  hours has hit some kind of record. I resolve not to turn on the TV again until tonight. It’s easier that way. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

through the gallery of winners, runners up and shortlist entries.The dramatic winning shot, from Pete Stevens, captured the spectacle of the natural world as a rare osprey swoops in on its prey in the Cairngorms National Park.Mr Stevens celebrated his win, saying he was inspired to take the photo after growing up in awe of his homeland’s natural beauty.He said: “Ive always loved being out and about in Scotland and having spent a lot of time in Aviemore and the Cairngorms.”Mr Stevens commended the National Park and RSPB for protecting the Osprey species, and allowing the animals’ numbers to grow over time.He added: “Last year was the first chance I had ever had to photograph the Ospreys and it was a brilliant experience which I hope to repeat this summer and in the future.”Grant Moir CEO of the Cairngorms National Park Authority said: “I am delighted that Pete was able to visit the Cairngorms National Park and get this winning photo.”“We work with our partners in Cairngorms Nature to

permission","story":"Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick revealed he is drawing up a regulations bonfire in a bid to finally deliver the , new homes a year needed to solve the housing crisis.A new planning blueprint will also boost councils’ power to use compulsory purchase orders to seize land that developers have failed to build on.Mr Jenrick told MPs yesterday that “home ownership seems like a dream out of reach” for too many still.He added: “The simple truth is too many will be priced outwe don’t build more homes.“To achieve the government is prepared to take bold action.“We must think boldly and creatively about the planning system to make it fit for the future.”Instead of bulldozing the green belt, the new strategy is centred on filling the nation’s existing towns and cities with many more homes than now.Ministers instead want current building owners to build upwards as well as to exploit more industrial and disused brownfield land.Britain’s urban spaces have some of the lowest housing densities in Europe because antiquated rules drawn up in  that keep roof lines low.A consultation has begun to define who should be automatically allowed to build up and how far, with limits still enforced for listed properties.But in a bid to see more homes built now, Mr Jenrick pledged to enact an immediate law change by the summer to allow developers to build two more storeys onto residential blocks of flats.The planning shake up will also see housing go up on top of and around train stations where there is unused space.And the government will also draw up more ambitious rules that will force councils to agree bigger home building targets in their areas.Mr Jenrick’s plans were warmly welcomed by campaigners.The Adam Smith Institute’s Head of Research Matthew Lesh said: “The Government’s housing reforms will improve the lives of millions by providing access to quality, affordable housing while substantially boosting the economy.“They could finally succeed where others have failed.”The new planning laws – to be published in a government white paper in the summer – follow a new £bn in the Budget on Wednesday for more affordable homes.The Government is desperate to get , properties built every year and give young people a chance to own one.The system needs total reinvention.

The rest had no preference.Respondents were also split on whether or not having a window open is necessary to get a good night of sleep, with  per cent saying they like a window to be open, compared to  per cent wanting all windows closed.The mattress was also a battle ground:  per cent preferred a softer mattress, whereas only  per cent preferred a firmer one.Whether or not the TV needs to be on also had Americans split. Forty-two percent say they typically fall asleep with it on, with  per cent saying they typically sleep with it off.The same goes for our comforters. About  per cent of respondents prefer to wrap up in a down comforter, compared to  per cent who opt for an alternative.But just because we hesitate to commit to someone who sleeps dferently than us, doesn’t mean it’s always a deal-breaker.The survey also found that, of those in a relationship, the average respondent endures nearly a month’s worth of sleepless nights every year just to accommodate their partner’s dfering sleeping needs.When it comes to their bedding, Americans can be quite selective. Memory foam pillows were the top choice for resting a weary head, followed by shredded foam and down.Memory foam was also the most popular type of mattress owned.Three in four of the respondents said they also prefer their bedding to have cooling features, with  per cent saying their biggest concern when sleeping is waking up too hot.“With foam mattresses being the most popular type owned and traditionally trapping in heat, it is no wonder that most are looking for cooling features in their bedding,” said Katie Mellott of Slumber Cloud.“When looking for bedding evaluate the dferent cooling technologies that are right for you and your partner.Bedding made up of fabrics such as bamboo and eucalyptus use moisture-wicking technology that works to cool you down after you sweat, others are designed to proactively cool you down and stay in a comfortable temperature range from the moment you get into bed.”Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are set to do the same in the UK.On Sunday, Apple chief executive Tim Cook asked employees at several of its global offices to work remotely this week “ your job allows”.Some universities are switching to online lectures next week.Durham University, the London School of Economics, Manchester politan and London politan announced the plans yesterday.Cambridge University is cancelling some end of year exams for medical students as it will involve prolonged contact with hospital patients.Durham — which breaks up for Easter on March  — said: “Teaching will be online from next week.

The Prime Minister introduced new measures to try and protect the elderly and vulnerable, saying anyone with coronavirus symptoms, however mild, such as a continuous cough or high temperature, must now stay at home for seven days. The advice also applies to children, meaning parents could need to take time off to look after their youngsters at home. The PM said school trips abroad should be stopped, while people over  with serious medical conditions should not go on cruises. Mr Johnson told reporters at a press conference in Downing Street that there was no need to close schools now as the scientic advice is that this could do more harm than good. He said this may change at some point while in the future,somebody is taken ill, their entire household could be told to self-isolate. Mr Johnson said families would continue to lose loved ones before their time as the coronavirus outbreak worsens. Weaposve all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation, said the PM. Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous. It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.What are the symptoms  Experts say the symptoms of coronavirus are a high temperature and a new, continuous cough. A high temperature is deemed to one above .C. Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said modelling predicted a -% reduction in the peak of the epidemic by getting people to stay at home for a weekthey have mild symptoms. Moving to whole household isolation adds an extra % reduction - so together those measures roughly half the size of the peak. Preventing the elderly from getting infected could reduce death rates by -%, Sir Patrick added. Will there be more announcements   Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty spoke of the need of isolating older and more vulnerable people - but that would not happen yet because it could have other negative consequences like increasing loneliness. But the tactic may change in the future. The Government could also advise anybody living with somebody who is taken ill to self-isolate for seven days, taking the total to  days, though that measure has not yet been introduced. The likelihood is measured will continue to be ramped up as scientists continue to decide how to best to defend citizens from Covid-, by studying how the disease acts, and by watching and learning from other countries’ experiences. What actions are the NHS taking   The NHS is examining how it can prepare to deal with the peak of the virus when it hits. Ultimately this means health service chiefs are looking at cancelling non-essential procedures and some primary care to free up capacity. The ultimate aim is to add to the  ventilated beds nationally - as the most serious cases of coronavirus will require oxygen to treat.  The government currently believes that the peak of the virus is about  to  weeks away. At the peak, the NHS could be stretched to capacity. Measures like self-isolation are expected to push down the peak of the infection and delay peak. If they can delay the peak, experts believe the pressure on the NHS will be lessened and we may see some benefit of the warm weather in slowing the spread. Why does the government think up to , people may now be infected   Modelling is understood to suggest that between  to  people could be infected. This is based on the number of people who have developed Covid- through community transmission - ie without a direct link to someone who is known to have the virus. At his press conference, Mr Johnson said: “The true number of cases is higher, perhaps much higher, than the number of cases we’ve confirmed with tests. Families are going to lose a loved one before there time. Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said: “Currently we’re on a trajectory that looks as though it’s four weeks or so behind Italy, and some other countries in Europe.” He added: “There are currently  cases that have been identied in the UK and there are more than  patients on intensive care units. “If you calculate what that really means, in terms of the total number, it’s much more likely that we’ve got somewhere between , and , people infected at the moment. “The same sorts of ratios will be true in other countries depending how much testing they’ve done.”  Todayaposs announcement marks a sht in the official advice. While previously people were told only to self-isolatethey have been in contact with an infected person or hotspot area or are told to by NHS . But now anyone who has a new and a persistent cough or a temperature - categorised by .C - is asked to stay at home. The Chief Medical Officer advised those with mild symptoms to treat it as they would do a sprain i.e. to stay at home and look after themselves.  People are asked to avoid calling  unless their symptoms get worse to keep it free. “It helps to protect older or more vulnerable people who they might come directly or indirectly into contact with,” he said. “It is important that people with very minor symptoms do not call .” Butpeople’s symptoms deteriorate then they should use the helpline. Prof Whitty said the virus was its most contagious when symptoms first appear so that by seven days the great majority of people are not infectious. “The evidence would appear to be that some people with even quite mild symptoms can spread this virus to a lot of people,” he said. “It is no longer necessary for us to identy every case and we will move from having testing mainly done in homes and outpatients and walk-in centres, to a situation where people who are remaining at home do not need testing.”  No. Unlike in Ireland and a number of other European countries the UK has no plan to close schools. The CMO advised that school closures were useful when a virus particularly hits children but that this form of coronavirus actually seems to affect children less. Meanwhile, closing schools would have a knock-on effect as it would keep parents at home - including some who are needed to staff the NHS and other vital services. But inidual schools may be told to closethey have cases of the virus. Mr Johnson said: We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientic advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only closethey are specically advised to do so. And that remains our advice. All schools have been told to cancel any planned international trips. Education is devolved to the Northern Ireland and Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament who could decide to close schoolsthey want to. Chief Scientic Adviser Patrick Valance said: Itaposs true that thereaposs some effect in closing schools but that effect is minimal and youaposd have to do it for - weeks or longer and you donapost need to be a very advanced mathematician to work out that the chances of keeping children not speaking to each other or playing with each for - weeks is zero and therefore you have to be very careful to make sure you take the right measures that will stop this rather than things which might end up with children for example going to stay with grandparents at the time they might be most vulnerable.  Not as a matter of course in the UK apart from in Scotland where the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has taken a separate decision to axe any events where more than  people are gathering. But that is not because of the spread - large-scale events actually donapost make the sp likely. Instead Ms Sturgeon says she was putting a stop to them to free up the NHS and other emergency workers. Mr Johnson said that he wasnapost taking a similar decision yet but that could change in the coming weeks and months. He said: We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientic advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread. But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect. Why do other countries appear to be doing more     Schools in Italy and Ireland are closed and America banned incoming flights. But according to the British experts drastic measures require the support of the public - and so when they are introduced is important. Prof Whitty said: “The important part of the science of this is the behavioural science.

Director-general Lord Tony Hall said it was “conceivable” a nonagenarian could be prosecuted for dodging the fee, when curbs are imposed from June. He was asked by the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committeehe “was really prepared to take - or -year-olds to court” for non-payment. He said: “I don’t want to see people going to court, of course I don’t. “It’s conceivable but we don’t want that. We absolutely don’t want to get there.” MP John Nicolson told him: “Imagine the reputational damage.  “The distress caused to these old people... You’d be in the bizarre position of sending out your news teams to cover -year-olds potentially up in court for non-payment of the TV licence because of a system you, Lord Hall, signed up for.” BBC policy director Clare Sumner said it was “highly unlikely” nonagenarians would be hauled before magistrates, adding: “We are doing everything to help support people to pay.” The corporation is under huge pressure for planning to restrict the over-s’ benefit to only those who receive Pension Credit after it takes over responsibility. Boris Johnson has urged the corporation to “cough up” and preserve the leline - despite the Tories breaking a  election manesto to maintain free licences.But MPs heard the BBC and Government have held no talks about reversing the decision. The Mirror has spearheaded the campaign to save the benefit, with up to . million pensioners forced to pay £. from June.

Professor John Ashton told the audience in West Bromwich on Thursday that four or five weeks had been lost because the country had failed to get to grips with the deadly bug quickly enough. He warned that the virus was amongst us and that now it would be left with the community to deal with. Professor Ashton, Director of Public Health for six years said: I donapost know where to start really. Iaposm embarrassed by the situation in this country. This talk of four stages and weaposre now moving on from the containment thing - weaposve lost the plot here. We havenapost taken the action we should have taken four or five weeks ago. Asking what should have been done by Question Time host Fiona Bruce, Professor Ashton said:Boris Johnson should have convened Cobra at the outset when it became clear what was cooking up. Countries that took firm action at the time -you look at whataposs happened in Hong Kong and Singapore, which had a lot of cases initially but which took firm action and theyaposve got the thing under control. Weaposve lost control here . Three thousands supporters came to Anfield from Madrid where theyaposre playing football behind closed doors. The virus is around in Madrid. That virus has been shared around Merseyside last night in the bars and clubs. The PM yesterday officially moved from the “contain” to “delay” phase of its attempts to battle against the pandemic – as the number of confirmed cases rose to . There were two more deaths, bringing the number to .  But the professor slammed the apparent failure for the Government to properly deal with people coming back from areas that have signicant outbreaks, like Italy, upon theirto the UK. He said: For reasons that are totally obscure to me, weaposve taken it as policy not to track the people whoaposve come back from Italy, not to test the people whoaposve come back from Italy so the virus will now be amongst us. The Governmentaposs approach as been paternalistic, itaposs been old fashioned, itaposs been top down and itaposs not done what needs to happen now - and weaposve lost four or five weeks. When asked why the UK hadnapost decided to shut down major sporting events like other countries have, Tory guest Steve Barclay defended the approach to the outbreak.

Dr John Campbell has been praised for his down to earth and intelligent daily advice videos which have racked up an incredible  million views.He has also amassed almost half a million subscribers to his channel Campbellteaching .His most viewed video to date was the first informational video he recorded about the coronavirus which has had K views. His second most viewed video on how to protect yourself and your family from COVID- has had K hits. Dr Campbell, who is a retired Nurse Teacher and A and E nurse, said that he created the videos to help people and stop them getting sick.  The -year-old said: I want to promote the health of my countrymen. Thataposs what we trying to do. Itaposs not about me. Itaposs about preventing the spread of the disease. He added: It has been quite a phenomenon. I started doing research into the virus in January. I read some papers from Chinese researchers and looked at the way the World Health Organisation was saying. I thought this was a bit strange. I looked at the way it was spreading and thought this could become a pretty large scale thing. I thought weaposve got a problem here. By early February I thought it could be a potential pandemic and people didnapost seem to be aware of this. Governments and official bodies didnapost seem to be very proactive about it so I made videos to get people to get thinking about it.  Iaposm surprised it has become so popular but clearly there is a thirst for information.  A lot of the information out there is dficult to understand so I make the videos so that the interested non-professional can take in the information. All through this the WHO and Government seem to have been reacting rather than carrying out proactive measures.   To control it we need quite dramatic Public Health interventions. Dad-of-two Dr Campbell records the videos in his little studio in a back room of his home in Carlisle.  Itaposs not very hi-tech, he says. I have an overhead camera and a HD webcam and it all goes into the same box that my son fitted up that, I believe, is used for gaming. I make some notes and work from them and explain the backgroud principles and use drawings to help illustrate things. Itaposs almost like being in the classroom. His approach to educating people around the world about COVID- in the simplest of ways has won him praise and even a suggestion the X Men star Sir Patrick Stewart should play him in a movie about the outbreak.  NursesOutlander urged others to watch his videos saying: For any of u wanting the best in health education  daily Covid- virus updates please visit Dr John Campbell’s YouTube channel. He’s a British nurse educator. He has a Doctorate in nursing. He’s an intelligent, Down to earth, common sense, fact based, articulate gentlemen. @ravaniaputri said: Dr. John Campbell, from the biology bible to a number of covid- videos on youtube. He has dedicated his le to educating others, you have my respect sir. @ScrougeOut said: LOL, I AGREE!! Dr. John Campbell is a daily youtube watch for me. Awesome factual info is put out by him!! JohnnyCovid said that Dr Campbell should be featured in any coronavirus movie tweeting: Patrick Stewart should play Dr. John Campbell for the upcoming #Coronavirus Movie.

Neighbouring Ireland has gone into lockdown with offices and schools closed from pm today. Scotland is also considering banning all public events with  people or more from Monday.  Donald Trump has banned all travel between the EU and the US, excluding the UK, for the next  days.In Italy million people have been put into quarantine with only food shops and pharmacies remaining open while the country battles the outbreak that has claimed the lives of more than  people.

Supermarket shelves have been stripped of items such as toilet roll, pasta and tinned goods, while some are now rationing products for customers. If you do have to self-isolate, here are the five key things the NHS advises you to do. . Stay at home and away from people It sounds obvious butyou do have to self-isolate, you need to make sure you stay at home. Donapost invite people into your home or have visitors and,possible, remain in a separate room to anyone  in your home. Only allow people who live with you to stay in your home. . Find a well ventilated room If you have to self-isolate youaposll be lacking in fresh air and sunlight.

Get deliveries dropped off outside If you need to have a food delivery, make sure itaposs dropped off outside your front door and donapost collect it from the driver. When theyaposve left, you can go and collect your delivery. If you have errands, prescriptions to collect or other items that need collecting, ask family or friends who arenapost self-isolating to get them for you. Again,youaposre having items dropped off, make sure theyaposre left outside and collect them when the person has left. . Clean bathrooms and toilets regularly Make sure your bathroom and toilet are clean.If necessary, create a bathroom rota with the person who is infected or has been forced to self-isolate using it last.

For those concerned about the environmental impact, Deyan recommended simply washing clothes on a more regular basis instead.Throwing your items into the heat of the tumble dryer can also help to kill off any nasties, and it also gives a good reason to iron your clothes for the same reason, as reported by The Sun ."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus what delay phase what","story":"NewsCoronavirus: What is the delay phase, and what does it mean for the UK The government has moved the UKs response to the Covid- pandemic from contain to the delay phase which could involve closing schools and cancelling large public eventsShareCommentsByDave Stubbings:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video leo-adkar-announces-details-ireland-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-what-delay-phase-what-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Prime Minister chaired a COBRA meeting at lunchtime on Thursday , where ministers are agreed to increase the response level from contain to delay. Currently  people have died and  people have been diagnosed with the Covid- disease in the UK, in what the Prime Minister has described as the worst public health crisis for a generation. Coronavirus has also officially been categorised as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. What is the delay phase  The delay phase is part two of the government’s four-step response to the killer virus. Phase one of the government’s response was contain, which aimed to prevent the spread of the disease by tracking down inidual cases and people infected. However with cases now approaching , the government is now looking to move to the second response, which is delay. The government’s official planning document describes the delay phase as: “Delay: slow the spread in this country,it does take hold, lowering the peak impact and pushing it away from the winter season.” What does the delay phase mean  Delay means the government can consider more drastic measures in an attempt to slow the rate the disease is spreading, as well as continuing with existing advice such as regularly washing your hands and self-isolation for those with symptoms. These new measures include potentially closing schools, although the PM has described that move as doing more harm than good at this time. The government can also encourage more working from home and postpone or even cancel large-scale gatherings, although Mr Johnson today said that move “will have little effect on the spread”. The governmentaposs official plan says: “Delaying the spread of the disease requires all of us to follow the advice set out below. The benefits of doing so are thatthe peak of the outbreak can be delayed until the warmer months, we can reduce signicantly the risk of overlapping with seasonal flu and other challengesthat the colder months bring.  “The Delay phase also buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines and or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease.” The government also says it will “aim to minimise the social and economic impact, subject to keeping people safe”, with decisions based on a combination of scientic evidence and consideration of “trade-offs involved”. Will the UK be under lockdown  Ministers have so far been unwilling to put in place measures similar to those seen in China, Italy and other countries around Europe. Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus was first reported, effectively closed down with severe restrictions on movement put in place . Meanwhile the Italian government has announced that all shops will be closed except for food stores and pharmacies . Football in Italy and Spain is also suspended while other matches around Europe are being played behind closed doors. So far no decisions on similar steps for the UK have been taken, although the Irish government has announced that all schools and colleges in the country will be closed for two weeks in an attempt to slow the spread.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe dad of a beautul six-year-old described watching on helplessly as the boy drowned in a river. Lucas Dobson had been spending time with his father and friends near the River Stour at Sandwich in Kent when he got into trouble in the water on Saturday August  last year. He was playing with other children on the river bank when he fell into the water between a jetty and a moored boat, the inquest in Maidstone was told. His father, Nathan Dobson, told the hearing that he was working on one of a number of vessels by the river, while his friend James Fromage was cooking on a barbecue and another friend, Pete Snelson, was fishing nearby.  Lucas tried to climb on to one of the boats with other children who were playing. Fighting back tears, Mr Dobson told the inquest: I looked down for less than a minute, and then I heard a commotion. I stood up and saw the look on Jamesapos face, and he said it was Lucas. Before a blink of an eye they were in the water looking for him. I saw James and Pete get in the water and I looked which way the current was going and I went a few boats up to jump in the river.Mr Fromage, at whose riverside property the boats were moored, told the inquest he had seen Lucas attempt to climb between the jetty and a boat. He said: He went for the rail [of the boat] and lted his foot and missed the rail and dropped, straight in feet-first. I dropped the barbecue tongs and jumped down to try and grab him, but I could not get in the gap between the boat and the mooring. Recollecting the conditions in the river that afternoon, Mr Fromage told how the surprisingly strong current had carried Lucas away from the spot where he was last seen falling into the water.  None of those present when the accident took place, including Lucas, were wearing lejackets or other safety equipment, the hearing was told. Despite searching frantically for some time, the friends were unable to find Lucas and the emergency services were called. A massive search began for Lucase, who lived in Deal, Kent, involving hundreds of local residents who joined expert volunteers from Kent Search and Rescue. Two days after he disappeared, Lucasapos mum Kirsty Furze led hundreds of well-wishers on a candle-lit walk to the end of Deal pier.  The familyaposs plight prompted a wave of support from people in coastal communities and several vigils were held. The boyaposs body was found, four days after he disappeared, on Wednesday August , close to where he went missing. A post-mortem concluded the cause of death was immersion. Area Coroner Joanne Andrews delivered a verdict of accidental death. Following the hearing, a statement on behalf of Lucasaposs mother Kirsty was read by solicitor Neille Ryan.He said: Lucas Dobson was a beautul, popular vibrant six-year-old boy. He loved singing, dancing cars and bikes. His loss has had a devastating effect on the family, so much so that Lucasapos mother Kirsty could not face being here today.

She posted the conversation with the caption: I applied for job as a waitress for Frankie  Bennyaposs.  He has just text me saying aposhey gorgeous x hows le treating youapos not indicating anything about the job until I questioned him who he was. I wanted to share because I find it very inappropriate as my CV has my date of birth clarying I am only  years old. Katieaposs post prompted another young woman to come forward, alleging that he had contacted her in a similar manner.  She sent Katie a screen shot of messages from the same number which appear to show the man repeatedly contacting her, despite getting no reply. Katieaposs post has sparked outrage among social media users. Charlotte Scully wrote: Thataposs actually disgusting. Hayley Baker added: He shouldnapost even be using your number thataposs terrible. Neil Richardson fumed: Unbelievable nonce like behaviour. Predator tendencies. And Sally Hurley said He has no right to use her details to make contact other than work related. He also clearly knew how old Katie is and although, yes legal, Katie is still a minor.  I wonder how many young ladies desperate for a job have been taken in by this vile excuse of a man. I do hope this is brought to the attention of head office, so itaposs dealt with properly.

While this is pretty straight forward for anyone who lives alone, it can be extremely dficult for families and people in shared houses. Weaposve had a look through exactly what self-isolatingyou live with other people involves. While the idea of all chilling in the living room together is appealing, government guidelines says you must all stay by yourself and canapost mix. Affected people must stay at home all the time. This means they canapost go to work or school. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. If you need food or other supplies, you canapost go out and get them and must ask family or friends to deliver them to you.  This normally involves staying in certain rooms of the house. If possible, the quarantined person should have their own bathroom which is not used by anyone  in the house. If you donapost have the facilities for this, they should always try to use the toilet last. The governmentaposs advice suggests setting up a bathroom rota for washing and bathing. If sharing a bathroom, the isolated person should clean it themselves after every use.  Towels should not be shared, and they should also have their own separate dishes, glasses and cutlery. Plates and cutlery should be washed in a dishwasherpossible. If you are living with somebody who is in self-quarantine, itaposs advised that you wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least  seconds. This should also be done every time you come into contact with the person or touching something they have touched. Wear a facemaskadvised to do so If you have been given a mask, wear it whenever you are in the same room with other people - including doctors and other medical staff.

The pair also chatted via FaceTime, but the call ended when WiFi dropped out at around midnught. William, from the Dorset village of Harmanaposs Cross, then took a bottle of brandy and drank half of it, before telling friends on Snapchat he wanted to hang himself.

He was arguing with his girlfriend over silly things and because he was very dramatic I think he drank half a bottle of brandy and was angry.

As Meghan Markle and Prince Harry prepare for their new lives after quitting the Royal Family and stepping back from their duties, weaposve had a look at what EXACTLY they - and other members of the Firm - get up to every day. The Queen Despite being , the Queen has a very, very busy schedule. Typically sheaposs woken up at .am to bagpipe music . Then itaposs paperwork time. The Queen spends her days answering letters, doling out knighthoods, having meetings with her staff and meeting and greeting diplomats, bishops, judges and military top dogs .  Because sheaposs the Queen and has to be organised, she reportedly allocates  minutes to each and knows, instinctively, when those  minutes is up. In recent years the Monarch has started to hand some of her patronages down to younger members of the family, including Kate and Meghan, to lighten her load slightly. When her paperwork and meetings are done, itaposs thought she takes her dogs for a walk. In the early evening, she studies a report of the dayaposs parliamentary proceedings and on Wednesdays she has an audience with the Prime Minister.  Sheaposs also said to enjoy photography as a hobby, just like Harry and Kate. Prince Charles Like the Queen, Charles has to keep up to date with everything going on in the government so spends time each day going through official state papers. He also heads up  Princeaposs charities, including The Princeaposs Trust, The British Asian Trust and Business in the Community. So presumably all of these keep him busy.  A keen gardener, Charles has also authored two books on ecology: Harmony: A New Way of Looking At The World, and On the Future of Food. Not only that, but he also devotes time to another hobby of his, watercolour painting, though the reviews have not been kind. In his role as heir, Charles is in charge of the Duchy of Cornwall - a private estate established by Edward III in . It covers , hectares across the UK, including farms, residential areas, commercial buildings and quarries.  It provides a huge amount of revenue each year, which is used to fund the public, private and charitable work of Charles, William and Harry and their wives. As the boss, Charles is responsible for overseeing it all, with the help of a team of  employees. Camilla Camilla supports her husband Charles as he carries out his royal duties. She also carries out her own solo engagements, and has become patron or president of more than  organisations and charities since joining the royal family. Even when sheaposs not visiting the charities, Camilla will be keeping up to date with her work.  As well as being step-mum to William and Harry, the Duchess has two children of her own - Laura Lopes and Tom Parker Bowles - and grandchildren, who she spends a lot of time with. Prince William Since quitting his part-time job for the East Anglian air ambulance, Prince William has focused on parenting and royal commitments. In the past he has faced criticism for being work-shy, but he spoke about his readiness to take more on in an interview with the BBC.  He said: Iaposm a new father and I take my duties and my responsibilities to my family very seriously and I want to bring my children up as good people with the idea of service and duty to others as very important. Since moving back to London, William has taken on a number of royal responsibilities from his grandmother the Queen. In his spare time, William is into sports and enjoys skiing. The Duchess of Cambridge Kate is also a very hands on mum to George, Charlotte and Louis but she has a lot of royal duties and responsibilities. She recently spoke of her aposmum guiltapos , saying she feels bad whenever she leaves her trio at home to go to work. When Giovanna Fletcher asked hershe struggled with it, she said: Yes absolutely - and anyone who doesnapost as a mother is actually lying. Yep - all the time, Even this morning, coming to the nursery visit here - George and Charlotte were like aposMummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off as school this morning apos  Itaposs a constant challenge - you hear it time after time from mums, even mums who arenapost necessarily working and arenapost pulled in the directions of having to juggle work le and family le. Much of Kateaposs charity work is angled towards children, with her latest project being the  Big Questions survey. Eagle-eyed royal watchers have spotted her on the school run and taking the kids swimming at the pool in Buckingham Palace. In  she also teamed up with her husband and Prince Harry to launch Heads Together. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Until the end of last year, Meghan and Harryaposs day to day would have been fairly similar to Kate and Wills. They spent their time caring for son Archie and working with the patronages and charities. Harry is president, ambassador or patron of a number of organisations including African Parks, Rugby Football Union, Sentebale and Rhino Conservation Botswana.  He also set up and is now patron of the Invictus Games, a competitive event for wounded, injured or sick servicemen, women and veterans. Shortly after joining the Royal Family in , Meghan also took on a number of Patronages. Like her husband, she picked causes close to her heart including The Royal National Theatre, animal charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get back into work through fashion. But from April it will be all change, as the couple step back from their royal lives. They have said they will continue working with their existing charities, but will face geographical challenges as they will be based in Canada most of the time.  As they are no longer royal and plan to be financially independent, the couple will be free to earn their own cash - and experts believe they could earn millions . Even though theyaposve been banned from using the word aposRoyalapos in their branding, itaposs not likely to impact their earning potential because of their global reach and links to the rich and famous. Harry and Meghan are already developing links with investment banking giants as they plan to rake in millions. Last month it was reported that  billionaire business moguls are desperate to bring the couple to play a starring role  at the World Economic Forum in Davos next year. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie The York sisters are the most senior royals who arenapost aposworking royalsapos, which means they have to go out and earn their own cash. Beatrice works in finance and consulting, and sheaposs currently the vice president of partnerships and strategy at software company Afiniti.  Referring to her as Beatrice York, the companyaposs website states: Beatrice is responsible for the management of the strategic Afiniti partnerships as well as company growth through unique initiatives and client development. Previous experience includes associate at Sandbridge capital a small consumer focused private equity firm. Business development associate at Sony pictures television. Beatrice began her career as a research analyst at a boutique private wealth firm. She received a degree in History and History of ideas from University of London, Goldsmiths College. Meanwhile Eugenie, who married Jack Brooksbank last year and lives at Kensington Palace, works as a director at London art gallery Hauser  Wirth. Both princesses are also involved with a number of charities and not-for-profit organisations they are passionate about. Beatrice will also be busy planning her royal wedding at the moment, which will take place on May . Zara and Mike Tindall Like their royal cousins, the Tindalls are also non-working royals which means they have to go out to work as well. Princess Anne made the decision not to give her kids royal titles, which means Zara had one of the more normal royal upbringings.  This also allowed her to have a career of her own as sheaposs not restricted by a HRH. Sheaposs a hugely successful equestrian and in  became the first member of the Royal Family to win an Olympic medal - taking the silver at the London games.

Severa Belotti, , and Luigi Carrara, , lived in the town of Albino, in the northern Italian province of Bergamo and reportedly spent eight days locked at home with a fever of  degrees. They were eventually taken to Bergamo Hospital last weekend. But their son Luca Carrara told local newspaper Corriere della Sera that they “died alone” in the facility as he was unable to say goodbye. He said: “Your loved ones stay alone and you cannot say bye, hug them, trying to give some comfort. The son wrote on social media: “Hi mum and dad, this bad virus made you leave the same day, will you keep bickering up there too  I think so, but then everything ended up in a hug. Luca, who is currently in quarantine with his family, claimed staff at Bergamo Hospital did not know where to put patients. He believes this was probably because doctors are doing a selection and letting the elderly people leave.

Speaking to Sky News Mr Fragapanni, who is one of those most at risk of catching the virus, was askedhe was worried and his answer was selfless. Yes, but not for me, he said. He went on: For everyone. For people in general. for everyone from the north to the south. For all the elderly people. Weaposve had many already died. Everything is closed. We need this. If the authorities launched these measures it is because they have to contain the virus. When askedhe had a message for the world he paused before starting to cry and saying: Hold on, hold on and hold on some more because we will overcome it.  Prime Minister Conte said: The right decision today is to stay at home. Our future and the future of Italy is in our hands. These hands have to be more responsible today than ever before. Italyaposs  million people are only able to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies. All schools and universities will not reopen before next month. The contagion only came to light near Italyaposs financial capital Milan on February .  Conte said last week that all outdoor public gatherings are forbidden and announced that all sports events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, would be suspended, throwing the closely watched championship into disarray. The politician added: We donapost have any time. The numbers are showing that there has been a signicant growth in infections, people in intensive care and deaths, he said in a sombre address.

An insider in neighbouring South Korea revealed to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper that the dictator was holed-up in Wonsan, a beach resort town. Intelligence analysis suggests that Kim Jong-un has been away from Pyongyang for a considerable time, the source said. This appears to be connected with the coronavirus outbreak. It comes amid reports that roughly  soldiers had succumbed to COVID- in the hermit kingdom. A source in the Northaposs military leaked the death-toll to South Koreaaposs Daily NK newspaper and said that most occurred close to the border with China. A further , soldiers were under quarantine, they added. Pyongyang continues to deny that COVID- has any presence within its borders. The regime is also developing a broad-spectrum antiviral injection which is highly effective in treatment of ious diseases, according to a report from Monday which didnapost name the virus. The most recent images of Kim Jong-un released by North Korean media, from Tuesday, show him overseeing a live-fire artillery exercise in an undisclosed location. In the images, he appears bare-faced alongside a deputy who dons a surgical mask. One of the photos shows munitions exploding on a clf face with water nearby, perhaps suggesting a coastal location. Itaposs unclear when he was last in the countryaposs capital, but photos dated February  showed him addressing the political bureau of the ruling partyaposs central committee, most likely in Pyongyang. He was previously photographed at Pyongyangaposs Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in a report dated February . Kim Jong-un is known to have been in Wonsan on March , when he oversaw another test-firing exercise.

Elizabeth Schneider caught COVID- at a house party hosted by her friend, but didnapost know how serious it was to begin with. Nobody at the small gathering was coughing or showing any signs of illness. But within three days,  per cent of the guests were sick - all suffering with symptoms associated with the virus including a high fever.Writing on Facebook , Elizabeth, from Seattle, said: The symptoms appear to be dferent depending on your constitution and or age.Most of my friends who got it were in their late s to early s. I’m in my mid s. For us it was headache, fever , severe body aches and joint pain, and severe fatigue. I had a fever that spiked the first night to  degrees and eventually came down to  and then low grade ..Some folks had diarrhea. I felt nauseous one day. Once the fever is gone some were left with nasal congestion, sore throat .Only a very few of us had a mild itchy cough. Very few had chest tightness or other respiratory symptoms.  The symptoms lasted between  and  days for the affected guests, but thankfully none of them were hospitalised. Despite their symptoms, Elizabeth says many of the group struggled to get tested. She ended up going through the Seattle Flu Study, and was quickly told she was positive. She has now completed her self-isolation period and the symptoms have gone but sheaposs still being very careful. She said: I have surpassed both deadlines so I am no longer isolating myself however I am avoiding strenuous activity and large crowds and I obviously will not come near youI see you in public. She now has a warning for people around the world as coronavirus continues to spread. She said: Hand washing doesn’t guarantee you won’t get sick, especially when folks without symptoms are contagious and could be standing right next to you in any given social situation.  You more likely than not will not die, but do you want to risk spreading it to a loved one over  or someone with an immunity issue  Stay healthy folks! I also truly believe the lack of testing is leading to folks believing that they just have a cold or something  going out into public and spreading it. And worse folks with no symptoms are also spreading it as in the case of a person attending a party or social gathering who has no symptoms. I know some folks are thinking that this can’t won’t impact them. I hope it doesn’t but I believe that the overall lack of early and pervasive testing damaged the public’s ability to avoid the illness here in Seattle. All I know is that Seattle has been severely impacted and although I’m better now I would not wish this very uncomfortable illness on anyone.  Elizabethaposs post in full I had COVID- and here is my story. I made this post public out of several requests from my friends who asked me to share. I hope it gives you some good information and peace of mind! First how easily you can get it. I believe I caught it when attending a small house party at which no one was coughing, sneezing or otherwise displaying any symptoms of illness. It appears that % of the attendees of this party ended up sick. The media tells you to wash your hands and avoid anyone with symptoms. I did. There is no way to avoid catching this except avoiding all other humans. % of folks were all sick within  days of attending the party all with the same similar symptoms including fever.  Second, the symptoms appear to be dferent depending on your constitution and or age. Most of my friends who got it were in their late s to early s. I’m in my mid s. For us it was headache, fever , severe body aches and joint pain, and severe fatigue. I had a fever that spiked the first night to  degrees and eventually came down to  and then low grade .. Some folks had diarrhea. I felt nauseous one day.Once the fever is gone some were left with nasal congestion, sore throat . Only a very few of us had a mild itchy cough. Very few had chest tightness or other respiratory symptoms. Total duration of illness was - days. The main issue is that without reporting a cough or trouble breathing many of us were refused testing. I got tested through the  Seattle Flu Study . This is a RESEARCH study here in Seattle and they have been testing volunteers for strains of the flu to study transmission within the community. A few weeks ago, they started to test a random subset of samples for COVID- infection. They sent my sample to the King County Public Health Department for confirmation however, I was told that all of the samples that have tested positive in the research study have been confirmed by Public Health. As of Monday March th, it has been  days since my symptoms started and more than  hours since my fever subsided. The King County Public Health Department is recommending you stay isolated for  days after the start of symptoms or  hours after your fever subsides. I have surpassed both deadlines so I am no longer isolating myself however I am avoiding strenuous activity and large crowds and I obviously will not come near youI see you in public. I was not hospitalized. Not every country is hospitalizing everyone with a COVID- infection and in my case, and in many other cases, I didn’t even go to the doctor because I was recovering on my own and felt it was just a nasty flu strain dferent from the ones I have been protected from with this season’s flu vaccine.  I also truly believe the lack of testing is leading to folks believing that they just have a cold or something  going out into public and spreading it. And worse folks with no symptoms are also spreading it as in the case of a person attending a party or social gathering who has no symptoms. I know some folks are thinking that this can’t won’t impact them. I hope it doesn’t but I believe that the overall lack of early and pervasive testing damaged the public’s ability to avoid the illness here in Seattle. All I know is that Seattle has been severely impacted and although I’m better now I would not wish this very uncomfortable illness on anyone. One thing that I believe may have saved me from getting worse respiratory symptoms is the fact that I consistently took Sudafed, used Afrin nasal spray , and used a Neti pot .

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/19893463-859x564.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 ayr hemmings and crankshaw goals see dark blues leapfrog honest men","story":"A FIFTH clean sheet on the bounce saw Dundee move into third spot after a deserved - victory over Ayr United at Dens Park.The Dark Blues stretched their unbeaten run to six matches as they saw off the Honest Men thanks to Kane Hemmings# th-minute opener and Olly Crankshaw#s first for the club.There were two changes to the Dundee starting XI as Christie Elliott replaced Cammy Kerr at right wing-back while Andrew Nelson came in for Jordan McGhee, who hadn#t recovered from a dead leg picked up against the Honest Men on Saturday.Goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was missing from the squad after his we gave birth on Monday night.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"music-review-elvis-costello-imposters-usher-hall-edinburgh","story":"Elvis Costello  The ImpostersUsher Hall, EdinburghKeith Brucefour starsALMOST  years ago, vocal trio Afrodiziak were, alongside a horn section, an extra ingredient of the expanded line-up of The Attractions for Elvis Costellorsquos Punch the Clock album.

Initially, in fact, we could have heard rather more of them in what was a ropey sound mix for Strict Time and Clubland, two tracks from rsquos Trust album, which this ldquoJust Trust tour is emphatically not showcasing, according to the man himself.It was on songs recorded with Kuroiand Lee, Suspect My Tears and Burnt Sugar Is So Bitter, from the Grammy Award-winning  set, Look Now, that they came into their own, setting the template for the triumphant final third of a full two hours of music.

It could be that the disruption caused by the coronavirus will turn out to be a relative blip and le willto normal, including regular travel abroad. Soon enough, the crowds could be back.It is not guaranteed, though. Travel, even at the best of times, is becoming more trouble than it is worth. Holidays abroad are increasingly spent recovering from the trip there and steeling oneself for the journey back. Hell is the modern airport.Given this, and increased awareness of climate change, more people will want to holiday close to home. Those who come from further afield will expect as eco-friendly a holiday as possible once they get here.Scotland is ideally placed to do well out of these changes. Or it would bewe had a transport system that was not a national embarrassment.The latest snafu is the cancellation of sailings between Brodick and Ardrossan. This is the busiest route in the CalMac network, serving , passengers. It is a flagship service in every sense, essential to Arran residents, businesses, and the wider tourist industry.There cannot be many Scots families who have not spent holidays on Arran. It is a fantastic island, the kind of place most countries would love to have a ferry ride away. The tourist board punts it as ldquoScotland in miniature but a better tag might be ldquoLike Vancouver Island, but closer.: Further ferry delays fearedNot only do Scots make good use of it, we recommend it, and indeed the rest of Scotland, wherever we go in the world. Yoursquoll have a great time, we tell people. To that we should add ldquoas long as you go at the right time.As far as travelling to Arran goes, now is not the best of times. It emerged this week that due to a fault with the mooring equipment ships can no longer berth safely in bad weather. According to CalMac the repairs could take up to six weeks, which runs right into the peak Easter holiday period.Why will it take so long  Because CalMac needs to source spare parts. If the parts were so essential one might imagine they would be held in stock, but that is to assume a level of efficiency that is proving beyond the service operators and their ultimate bosses, the Scottish Government.The latest problems take place against the backdrop of spiralling costs and y delays in the delivery of two new ferries. Vessels that should have cost pound million are now priced at more than double that, and they will not be in operation till  at least.Gavin Fulton, chair of Arran Ferry Action Group, has described the situation as ldquoa shambles. He told The Heraldrsquos reporter Martin Williams that patients on the island were having to spend up to five days on the mainland just to get to a hospital appointment and back.ldquoThings are going from bad to worse for us and there is no contingency plan, he added. ldquoThere is no word of chartering a boat, or to buy one abroad. It is a case of waiting  months for a new ferry and we have to put up with it.Mr Fulton is not alone in his despair. Another essential route, at the Rest and Be Thankful, is prone to closure due to landslips, forcing drivers on a -mile detour. It was announced recently that more millions are to be spent on repairs rather than a reroute of the A. Iain Jurgensen of the Argyll and The Isles Tourism Co-operative said it was ldquostaggering and irresponsible to keep spending public money on patching the problem rather than sorting it out once and for all.: Anger as services haltedIt is not just rural areas that are suffering from the lack of a joined up transport system in Scotland. Rail travel between two of the countryrsquos biggest cities is expensive, unreliable and overcrowded. Bus services across the country y wildly in price and efficiency. In Glasgow the subway does not operate on a Sunday evening. Too often the only way to ensure getting somewhere on time is to go by car, and even then good luck with the potholes.Of course there have been successes, chief among them the Queensferry Crossing. Leaving aside recent closures due to snow and ice the bridge was delivered with only a slight delay, again due to weather, and under budget, something of a miracle for large projects.Yet the Queensferry Crossing aside, Scotlandrsquos transport is too often in reverse or going nowhere fast.Part of the problem is that the subject has become politicised, alongside much  in Scottish le. Take the recent Queensferry Crossing closures. Instead of having a rational discussion about them, the row became another proxy war over Scottish independence. Criticising Scotlandrsquos transport, like questioning educational attainment or NHS waiting times, is seen as ldquotalking Scotland down.It would be funnyit was not so ridiculous. When you travel to another country you donrsquot give two toots of a horn who built what road and when, or who runs the ferry service.: Time to end monopoly of ownershipAll the traveller wants is a reliable service that will take them where they want to go at a reasonable cost both to themselves and the planet. That is what Scots desire as well, and it is not too much to ask.Transport is such an obvious building block for any successful country it should be above political bickering. Even given the problems of geography, it should not be beyond our ability to build a national transport infrastructure that works for all the people most of the time.Since nothing broadens the mind on transport like using the system, herersquos a suggestion. If more of our MPs and MSPs were to venture outside the Central Belt they could see the problems for themselves. Perhaps, once this latest spell of disruption is over, some of them could try commuting from Arran for a spell, or venture beyond the Rest and Be Thankful.Donrsquot forget to send us a postcardand when you arrive."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11142849.jpg?type=article-full","title":"paddleboarding-seen-opportunity-500m-scots-marine-tourism-boost-bid","story":"The Giant Stride plan launched at the Marine Tourism Conference aims to boost Scotlands reputation as \"a world-class sustainable marine tourism destination\" by meeting changing consumer, workforce, community and environmental needs and grow the industryrsquos economic contribution to over pound million by .It aims to build on the last five-year strategy called Awakening the Giant which set out to grow visitor expenditure from poundm to poundm and increase the sectorrsquos overall economic value from poundm to over poundm by .

That has gone. We have to think of a dferent approach to town centres and what is envisaged in the hubs is far more sustainable.ldquoWe have to have a core medium-to-long-term plan. In the past we have not had that plan.ldquoI think this vision is bold and ambitious. Do you want us to continue doing what we are doing  Becausewe do, it is tantamount to managing decline.

Scotland has around , acute beds and  in intensive care units, but the Government has estimated that a worst-case scenario could see around , requiring critical care.Ms Freeman said: ldquoWe have active work going on looking at how we can increase the number of beds available in our hospital settings, doubling the number of intensive care units that we have and equipping them and staffing them.

Following yesterdays COBRA meeting, Nicola Sturgeon gave a public briefing about where we are and what the next steps will be.Commentators wound themselves up at the fact Ms Sturgeon went ahead before Boris Johnson had a chance to give his national briefing, these commentators sniping asshe was a prime ministerial understudy, rather than the leader of a country.This really isnt the time for constitutional squabbles. A well kent journalist called the First Ministers actions \"a borderline coup detat\". Things have certainly taken a turn for the mundane since the days of the Rum Rebellion.A so-far relaxed Boris Johnson put a fine point on it during yesterdays post-COBRA briefing. \"I must level with the British public,\" the prime minister said, \"Many more families are going to lose their loved ones before their time.\"This is, incidentally, from the same prime minister who was only in the last few days showing a cavalier attitude to handshakes, despite having a pregnant partner at home.In the coming days and weeks it is likely that people will be asked to work from home. Large events will be cancelled its possible that schools will be closed. There will be claim and counter claim, back and forth, about whether our respective governments are doing enough to stem the outbreak. There will be disputes about whether they are working effectively together.In a more minor way, social distancing will be expected - staying two metres or so away from other people, avoiding unnecessary trips out. There will be grumbling, at best, and lonely isolation, at worst.The crisis will show just how much we rely on unpaid care work to keep things ticking over. Grandparents, who fill so many of the childcare gaps, will have to step back from their duties for their own protection. The slack pulled by those of us who have caring responsibilities for older and elderly relatives will be stark.School closures, of course, have a much broader impact than exams being cancelled. Exams, while this is stressful for young people who are relying on results to steer choices that will shape their futures, can be rearranged.What of the pupils who take free school meals or attend breakfast clubs or holiday lunch clubs - for them education comes with a literal side serving, and one that is vital to making ends meet in straitened homes.There was concern expressed by a medical expert that cancelling sports matches will only serve to push people to gather in pubs to watch games.In a political climate where the focus is on the inidual, we will have to radically alter our thinking to focus on the collective good during this crisis.We will need to be willing to sacrice our pleasures - sports, the cinema, theatre and gigs. When stocking up on those extra tins, there must be a pause to consider whether we really need as many as were taking or are we leaving someone who is more vulnerable without.On Facebook groups have already sprung up encouraging those who are willing and able to commit to making food drops to elderly and vulnerable people in their communities. From disaster springs a bit of hope.The early narrative that said we shouldnt worry too much because coronavirus \"only\" seriously affects the elderly and those with underlying health conditions has been roundly criticised with its quiet assumption that the elderly and the vulnerable have less value than those with robust health and youth.We need to go a step further and really prioritise choices that will put prioritising the worst affected groups to the fore.As social distancing takes its toll wersquore going to need community to get us through."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-council-tells-woman-must-apply-keep-pink-door---single-complaint","story":"Council chiefs ordered the North Berwick homeowner to submit retrospective planning proposals for the colour refresh - designed to fit in with other homes in the area which have entrances painted red, yellow and blue.:Scottish council spends more than pound, on flights despite declaring climate emergencyBut the decision clearly irked one local, who complained the home - located in Dirleton Avenue - was in the picturesque seaside townrsquos conservation area.The complainant argued that, given the homersquos historic status, any move to change the frontage would have to be subject to council approval.However, the homeowner, who has not been named, pointed out the door is not visible from the street because of high hedges and its corner location.And she said she had been told by planning officers that they had only received one complaint about the colour of the door.Applying for planning permission for the paintwork, which is described as coral, she said: ldquoI had no idea that I needed planning permission for this and assumed it would be okay as there are many other strong coloured front doors in our local streets.ldquoOur door was chipped and neglected and I was aiming to make it appear smarter ndash it very much ties in with my design aesthetic and these colourful front doors are becoming increasingly popular in both conservation areas and outwith.As well as producing photographs of other properties with boldly painted doors, the applicant points out that one neighbouring house has pink rendering on its walls.:Whisky and cheese pairings among projects given Scottish Government food fundingShe added: ldquoWe invested considerable money in upgrading the front door and the gilded lettering and have received many compliments.The planning application is being considered by council officers."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus case confirmed in grampian","story":"Two new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Scotland, bringing the total to three.One is in Grampian and the other in Ayrshire.Both patients were said to be clinically well and receiving care.One recently travelled to northern Italy and the other has had contact with a known positive case – this contact was not with the first positive case confirmed in Scotland in Tayside.Clinicians have begun contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places they have visited and the people they have been in contact with.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: “Our first thoughts must be with the patients diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a full and speedy recovery.“We expect the number of cases to rise and Scotland is well-prepared for a signicant outbreak of coronavirus. “There is currently no treatment or vaccine so early detection measures will continue to be vital in helping to prevent the spread of the virus.“People have a vital role to play in helping us contain any outbreak by following the latest health and travel advice, and following basic hygiene precautions, such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Aberdeenshire licensing boards could merge viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus second case in grampian","story":"A second case of coronavirus has been diagnosed in Grampian.Scotland’s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood has confirmed a further three patients have tested positive for COVID-, bringing the total number of Scots cases to six.The patients are currently clinically well and are receiving appropriate clinical care.They are from the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Grampian areas.

If we win, it would be absolutely fantastic. It would do our points tally no end of good. It will be very strange to be getting updates from people south watching Orkney while I#m watching Orkney at home.#This topic actually was included in #s Knowledge newsletter where a crack team of anoraks answer some of the most obscure questions on footballing knowledge.One twitter user asked: “Has a professional team in living memory had to play twice in a day ”The question attracted several responses.#If you go back a century or more, this wasn’t unusual, and arose from teams who were unable to play in midweekand having to cram in postponed games before an end-of-season deadline,” writes Andrew Wright, citing several in Scotland including Celtic’s wins over Raith and Motherwell on April , .“Argentina and Uruguay have played each other twice on the same day three times,” Andrew continues. “In , they played friendlies in Montevideo and Buenos Aires on  April. Given the distance between these cities is km, I doubt the same players were involved. Uruguay won - at home and drew - away. They repeated the exercise on July , with Uruguay winning - at home and drawing - away.#On October , , they played for the Uruguayan Honour Cup in Montevideo, with Argentina winning -, and the same day, in Avellaneda for the Lipton Cup, where Argentina again won -.#He also unearths a more recent example from an African football blog: Nairobi’s Gor Mahia played KTM Thika and Kericho Allstars on the same day in the s.Brazil have also crammed two fixtures into a day, adds Amadeu Faccini Avi, drawing - with the Soviet Union and beating Hungary - in , one in Rio and one in São Paulo.Staying in Brazil, São Paulo beat Sporting Cristal - in the Conmebol Cup on the same dayas a - triumph over Grêmio. Not to be outdone, Grêmio played three games on one day in , against Aimoré, Santa Cruz and Brasil de Pelotas, all in their state cup.“Thirty-four players were involved and three of them played more than once,” Amadeu adds.In England, Everton once played three matches in two days in , writes Tim Lawrence — in the Lancashire Cup against Blackburn on Christmas morning followed by an annual exhibition against Ulster FC in the afternoon, winning both. The following day they wearily drew - with Bootle.Most recently, Hornchurch of the Ryman League had to play two games in a day at the end of the   season and in Wales, Mark Barnes recalls a youthful Wrexham side, who took on Airbus in the Welsh Cup in December , kicking-off a mere half hour before a more experienced Red Dragons selection beat Brentford in the FA Cup.A link to the article is here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

Dan Redmond was brought up in a supportive family but dogged through his youth by violence - and this had him walking a fine line with authority.JAPANAs many people will attest who have been through similar and often damaging experiences, it was the martial arts that pretty much saved Dan, gave him direction and steadied the ship. “Eventually his pursuit of knowledge and the best training in karate took him to such places as mainland Japan, Okinawa and the USA on a number of occasions.Over the years, Dan has built up a very solid reputation in the karate world and his journey through le with the martial arts as his compass is engagingly told in this well written biography.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"invest ni host 319 visits by investors but only 14 came to west of","story":"ONLY  visits were made to the West Belfast constituency by potential inward investors, hosted by economic development agency Invest NI, compared to  in South Belfast new figures reveal.The figures for   also show that East Belfast received  visits, while North Belfast had  visits. West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night.

It#s a whole of government issue, including local government.As an Executive we took the decision right at the start of this process and we continue with the position that we will always take our advice on medical evidence, based on scientic evidence, to act quickly and proportionately to protect public health.Those measures include the proposal that anyone with mild symptoms of Covid- should self-isolate for seven days and should do that as quickly as they identy those symptoms.Next week we will be revisiting some of the other issues but it#s important that we do everything in a timely fashion.Sinn Fein vice-president Ms O#Neill stated that it was a very confusing time for people but the scientic evidence was clear in regards to school closures.There will be heightened anxiety, people will be worried in terms of messaging, particularly with the decision to close schools on one part of this island, she continued. We have a situation here in the north where we are not at that stage yet. We collectively, as an Executive, are working together and taking every step necessary to make sure that we are fully prepared and we can do everything we can in terms of our response to this public health emergency.We are very much guided by the science that suggests that this is not the right decision at this time. We have taken the decision to keep that under review so we will work very closely to make sure that we keep that under review.Meanwhile, an expert has said closing schools could increase the risks for elderly grandparents and reduce the number of NHS workers available for the frontline fight against coronavirus. Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said it was still too early to say whether steps taken in Ireland were a sensible precaution or an overreaction for the current stage of the epidemic.Belfast Related ContentCommentOpinionTom Kelly:Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar need common approach tocoronavirus threatRemember the song about Simple Simon  The one were he says and you do  GalleryCoronavirusUK and Republic split on coronavirus response with Northern Ireland caught in middle of mixed messagesThe British and Irish Governments have both insisted they are dealing with coronavirus in the right way after they announced radically dferent approaches to tackling the pandemic.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#ve no idea how many homes would have been visited afterwards. Surely there is some sort of policy in place that those delivering the goods should be abiding by Tesco told the Belfastthe company has a process for allowing customers to alert a delivery driver in advancethey want their delivery left at a convenient place for collection.The delivery will be placed into bags and left as requested - but the issue is that drivers need to know this in advance. Asda and Sainsburys had not replied to a request for a response, but Andrew Opie, director of Food and Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said all companies are working as hard as they can to minimise the impact of the virus.Most of our members are more than happy for the majority of online deliveries to be delivered on doorsteps when customers have suggested that they are self-isolating, he said.Despite dficult times, retailers strive to provide the best service for their customers, both online and in-store and are working as hard as they can to ensure consumers have access to whatever products they want.A PHA spokesperson reiterated that it remains vital the guidelines offered to those in self-isolation are followed.People in self-isolation are expected to follow the advice they have been given to limit any potential spread of the virus.With regard to deliveries, the Public Health Agency recommends that advice developed by Public Health England on this issue is followed.This advice states: #You will need to ask for helpyou require groceries, other shopping or medications.Alternatively, you can order by phone or online. The delivery instruction needs to state that the items are to be left outside, or in the porch, or as appropriate for your home#.Last week companies including Asda and Deliveroo issued advice to delivery drivers in a move to stop them from contracting the virus.Deliveroo riders have been sent official guidelines based on the advice of the NHS and public health bodies, which include how to stay safe when delivering an order.For Asda workers, home delivery staff have been advised to follow government advice, including guidance on hand-washing.

He also said all large indoor and outdoor gatherings should be cancelled, and encouraged home working and limited socialising.It was expected that Boris Johnson would announce similar measures later, but during his conference late on Thursday afternoon the Prime Minister said that while the UK will move to the delay phase of the virus, he is not currently closing schools.Mr Johnson told reporters at a Press conference in Downing Street that there was no need to close schools now as the scientic advice is that this could do more harm than good.Mr Johnson said he is still considering whether to cancel major sporting events and mass gatherings.He said this may change at some point while in the future,somebody is taken ill, their entire household could be told to self-isolate.Mr Johnson said: We#ve all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation.Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous. It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.Meanwhile, in a joint announcement between First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, it was revealed that the Stormont Executive was only given a  minute warning ahead of Mr Varadkar#s statement.Sinn Fein#s vice-president added that the Executive will probably have to make a decision about closing schools in the future.Virologist Dr Connor Bamford said he believed there were dferent arguments for both strategies and it was too early to say which government has made the right decision.Thursday#s drama came as:The Public Health Agency revealed there were two new presumed positive cases of coronavirus in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to .Two more patients died in UK hospitals after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to , NHS England said.Health Minister Robin Swann told Stormont#s Health Committee that deaths should be expected in Northern Ireland.Another  cases of Covid- were confirmed in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the total to .The UK Government#s chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said up to , people could be infected with coronavirus.Queen#s University Belfast announced that all large-scale events would be postponed with immediate effect.The Bosnia and Herzegovina FA and the Slovakia FA asked Uefa to call off their Euro  play-off matches against Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.All GAA and rugby in Ireland, including the Danske Bank Schools Cup and Ulster Rugby, was postponed until March .Down Royal Racecourse said its St Patrick#s Day race meeting on March  will run behind closed doors.With the Republic taking more stringent action than the UK, Downing Street defended the UK-wide approach being taken by the Prime Minister and adopted in Northern Ireland.The Prime Minister#s official spokesman was asked whether Northern Ireland would now be treated dferently from the rest of the UK in response to the Irish move.In terms of our own response, we have said that we want it to be a UK-wide response and we have been working with the four chief medical officers and devolved administrations, the spokesman said.Asked about the dference in the approach in Dublin, the spokesman added: We follow our own advice, they will do the same.Mr Varadkar was also asked for his view on the dferent approach being taken to coronavirus here.Northern Ireland is a dferent jurisdiction from the Republic of Ireland and they are making some dferent decisions, he said.For example in Northern Ireland the schools are staying open whereas in the Republic they are closing. We are dferent jurisdictions, dferent decisions will be made but we are going to keep in very close contact so that we inform each other of decisions we#re making and our thinking behind them.Reacting to Thursday#s contrasting approaches by the two governments, Alliance Party health spokeswoman Paula Bradshaw felt that Northern Ireland was taking the lead from Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride, rather than the Prime Minister.The South Belfast MLA said she was confident that the decision to keep Northern Ireland#s schools open was made by medical professionals here, rather than in England.We have a lot of bright brains and I suppose people have been saying in the last few hours that we#re taking the lead from Boris but I don#t think that#s the case, she continued.Dr Michael McBride is a very intelligent man and he#s surrounded by a lot of experts.The decision for Northern Ireland would very much have been made by people here who know how our health service works, know what our infrastructure is like and [are] very much across the detail of what will work when the time comes to move into those phases of closing and restricting access.However, People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said it was patently absurd that the Republic is taking the sensible strategy to close schools while Northern Ireland is not.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus: Decision not to close Northern Ireland schools based on #clear scientic evidence#The First and Deputy First Ministers jointly insisted yesterday that the Executive chose not to close Northern Ireland#s schools based on scientic evidence.CommentOpinionTom Kelly:Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar need common approach tocoronavirus threatRemember the song about Simple Simon  The one were he says and you do  VideoVideo NewsLeo Varadkar: We#d rather be safe than sorry\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_acaf--e--bddcbaf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_acaf--e--bddcbaf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_acaf--e--bddcbaf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_acaf--e--bddcbaf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bca .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_acaf--e--bddcbaf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"WorldUS ‘failing’ in coronavirus testing, health official saysThe US lag in coronavirus testing is “a failing”, a top federal health official has said.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Weir also said that ACM is removed throughout the EA estate when the risk assessment dictates that removal is required, adding that the approximate cost of asbestos removal is in the region of £-m annually.He added: Unfortunately, it is not possible to be absolutely certain all ACM have been removed from a building until that building is demolished, as ACM was used extensively in the structure of buildings constructed before the year .Jacquie White from the Ulster Teachers# Union said the total removal of asbestos is the safest option.Nothing can be more important than the safety of children and teachers, so this is a worrying finding, she said.It is compounded by the fact that, according to the Health and Safety Executive ,  people here died from asbestos-related conditions in , the last figures available.In the UK as a whole over  teachers have died in the last decade from the effects of being exposed to asbestos, according to government statistics.Add to this that for each teacher fatality, nine ex-pupils can also be expected to fall victim to the silent killer, according to the American Environmental Protection Agency, and you can appreciate just how insidious the problem is. Ms White said the deadliest form -  times more lethal than the commonest - was still present in  schools here, according to an audit in  following a health scare in a Belfast secondary school.Asbestos truly is a hidden killer and as such it#s easy for teachers and pupils not to realise the potential for harm, she said.Something as simple as stapling posters on to walls containing asbestos could release the harmful fibres, while some items, such as old gas masks used in history lessons, can also contain the material.Schools are required to hold an asbestos register and management plan and advice from the HSENI is that unless it is damaged, asbestos can be left in place and monitored.However, we believe the total removal of asbestos is the safest option, unless there is good reason not to do so.Mr McNulty said the ongoing asbestos removal works is a step in the right direction. Only when asbestos is disturbed is it a danger, however, it shows that our school estate is aging and I think we need to seek further clarity from the minister, he said.I want to see a dedicated programme to have all asbestos removed from schools. We have to endeavour to do this. The Health and Safety Executive Northern Ireland website states: Asbestos can be found in any building built before the year , including houses, factories, offices, schools or hospitals, and causes around , deaths every year in the UK.The Department of Education was contacted for comment.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDUP man#s son told PSNI #he didn#t want to walk past Fenians#Easyjet#s £ quote for flights to Birmingham days after Flybe collapse branded #ridiculous#Northern Ireland manon trial accused of raping his mother while she sleptBelfast mum #horried# after thugs smashed son#s head against a wallDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widow,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If we think about HS, from London Euston to Birmingham Airport on HS will take only  minutes, there is huge improvements in transport infrastructure around the world.“We are lagging behind in this country and we believe we should look at all options.”Experts have warned the depth of the Irish Sea and the presence of dumped munitions would cause problems for any crossing.The project could cost a reported £ billion, although Mr Johnson has previously said it would “only cost about £ billion”. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson has repeatedly spoken about the prospect of a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland The Scottish Government has insisted better uses could be found for the funds – with Transport Secretary Michael Matheson making this point in a recent letter to his UK counterpart Grant Shapps.Meanwhile economic experts at the Fraser of Allander Institute said a new crossing would neither boost the economy nor improve connectivity.In a damning assessment of the proposal, it stated: “In short, it won’t deliver the economic boost some claim, it isn’t a priority, it would go to the wrong location, it wouldn’t be consistent with climate change objectives and the money could be better spent on other things.“Apart from that, it’s a cracking idea.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDUP man#s son told PSNI #he didn#t want to walk past Fenians#Easyjet#s £ quote for flights to Birmingham days after Flybe collapse branded #ridiculous#Northern Ireland manon trial accused of raping his mother while she sleptBelfast mum #horried# after thugs smashed son#s head against a wallDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widow,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDUP man#s son told PSNI #he didn#t want to walk past Fenians#Easyjet#s £ quote for flights to Birmingham days after Flybe collapse branded #ridiculous#Northern Ireland manon trial accused of raping his mother while she sleptBelfast mum #horried# after thugs smashed son#s head against a wallDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widow,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They include th, th and st century shoes beached at Orford Ness in Suffolk a  Claws crisp packet and a s Picnic at Formby Smarties lids from before , and even a post-Prohibition era bottle of rum from the US.Some of the items that turn up on UK beaches are from far afield, including an aerosol can from Saudi Arabia and plastic debris covered in goose barnacles thought to have drted from the Caribbean.There is also the Canadian research buoy washed up at White Park Bay in Northern Ireland, still recording temperatures and sending data via satellite, and sonar equipment from Texas which turned up at the Giant#s Causeway.But some of the debris is from closer to home, including a council bin from Peterborough, nicknamed Pete, which travelled  miles along the River Nene to Blakeney Point.Cargo lost at sea can also account for rubbish washing up on beaches, such as nautical-themed Lego from a  spill at Land#s End, and BMW parts, dog biscuits and oil-covered Mars bars from the MSC Napoli grounding off Devon in .Phil Dyke, coastal specialist at the National Trust, said: It#s fascinating to hear of the unusual things that land on our beaches, whether they#re relics from history or objects that have travelled thousands of miles.But as weird and wonderful as these items are, they tell a more serious story about the permanent nature of plastic, and the constant deluge of marine litter arriving on our shores.No one in the UK lives more than  miles from the coast, so whether we#re in the city or the country, everything we do impacts on the health of our seas.He added: Even small actions like using less packaging and picking up litter can make a dference.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Studies also show that children aged five and up from the poorest income groups are twice as likely to be obese compared to their more advantaged counterparts. Serena Terry from Elemental said they were pleased to be part of the project.“This is a really exciting project for us that has huge transferable potential.“Elemental’s roots are firmly embedded in the communities that benefit from our social prescribing technology, so to get the opportunity to combine the capabilities of our  with the success of the SWEET programme and create an innovative new app is an incredible opportunity for us.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Amongst them, one person beamed you should write I couldn’t see anyone there!’, laughing like he had pulled a joke out of the Billy Connolly catalogue. So firstly, I want to assure you I won’t be taking that route. So,you are looking for a pun or two, you won’t be able to see any he... - dammit, let’s move on.The Invisible Man is a continuation of Hollywood’s new found love for reboots, with the classic novel by HG Wells first brought to the big screen back in , and this time we have Australian director Leigh Whannell taking the reins to give it a more modern touch.Whanell, who is attached to previous horror thriller block- busters such as Saw and Insidious as a writer, is well experienced in the genre, and from minute one, you know the film is in very good hands.The film tells the story of Cecilia, played by Elisabeth Moss.We are thrown straight into her unhappy world in an opening sequence that absolutely sets the tone for what is to come in terms of sheer tension.Cecilia has drugged her boyfriend Adrianinto a deep sleep in the early hours of the morning, and immediately sets about the process of getting the hell out of there.Which wouldnt be too dficult in a normal house, but a normal house it is not.She has to tread a gadget world obstacle course featuring security alarms, passwords and cameras in what I can only describe is a setting you would see in a Mission Impossible meets  type of film.Because it turns out, her boyfriend is a genius millionaire scientist control freak who has taken every precaution in an attempt to keep her in his clutches.After narrowly making her escape thanks to her sister Emily, Cecilia finally has some sort of freedom, but matters soon take a very strange turn. Shortly afterwards she is delivered the news that Adrian has killed himself by his lawyer brother, and that he has also left  million of his vast fortune to her. So hey, it’s not all bad.Except it is it’s very bad.Just when Cecilia believes her le is becoming a little bit rosier, events begin to spiral out of control in quite sinister ways. The oven suddenly goes on fire, her blanket is tossed around her bedroom, and she too ends up drugged. Adrian still very much has a pulse, and through his scientic and technical wizardy, he’s only gone and made himself invisible in a bid to make his ex’s le a living hell, with very tricks more brutal than the last. A new tinder account and going back on the market would have been less hassle, but, what do I know Now on paper, it all sounds a bit over the top, and in the hands of a lesser film maker I may have headed for the exit early.But this film delivers, for two reasons.Firstly, Whanell’s direction is flawless. He burrows into the quite effective horror trope of less is more, not resorting at all to endless jump scares that we see too often nowadays.His camera work excels in making the viewer completely uneasy throughout. There is one sequence where the camera is simply moving slowly from left to right while Cecila wanders the house alone during the night. Whanell plays with the audience superbly. He knows he has us in the palm of his hand. Where is Adrian  What will he do next Now in a role that requires the lead to portray terror, paranoia, rejection and abuse, Elisabeth Moss is outstanding.This is a film with very strong themes in some quarters it has been called the first big film of the #metoo movement in its representation of domestic abuse, and there is certainly symbols of that at dferent stages, with Moss carrying the flame in fine fashion as she attempts to defeat her own predator.She is utterly convincing in her despair as her world begins to fall apart from all angles, including one horrying turn of events that will have your jaw almost touching the floor - you have been warned. She shows all her acting props that were also on display in the hugely popular Handmaids Tale series.So,you’re a weirdo like myself and enjoy being disturbed and uncomfortable for two hours or so, then ‘The Invisible Man’ will be money well spent.Hey, we might even get a sequel, although, given the films climax, ‘I canny see that’ happening.I’ll stop now.The Invisible Man is now showing at Brunswick Moviebowl. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Members attending the meeting were also informed of the proactive contingency measures being put in place to protect vital council services. googletag.cmd.push In view of this, members agreed that council should close two of its public buildings with immediate effect, to allow vital services to continue in anticipation of other facilities being forced to close at a future date. The main civic council offices in Derry Road, Strabane and the Brandywell Sports Centre building will both close from this evening at pm for operational reasons, to allow these buildings to be available and fit for purpose to provide essential public services over the coming weeks. The Glenside office located behind the civic offices on Derry Road will remain open to the public and Derry Road staff are being relocated to alternative sites including Glenside, Strahan Road or the Civic offices in Derry’s Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push Members at the briefing heard that the closure of the buildings would allow council to carry out essential services such as waste management, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, cemetery provision and financial services, during this challenging time.

She said: “By closing these two buildings and making them sterile zones it will allow us to provide a reduced but essential level of service provision.

At , the long-time proprietor of a Pennyburn sports shop is a le-affirming example to others of how to live a meaningful le after sporting retirement, thanks to the enduring power of friendship.  He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

With the wind at their backs, the Limavady youngsters settled into the game quickly and almost took a deserved early lead when an in swinging corner was glanced just wide of the Harps’ goal. Limavady had most of the ball early on as Harps struggled to settle but with the back three of Campbell, McLaughlin and O’Donnell holding firm, they were reduced to testing goalkeeper Downey-Campbell from distance.As the half progressed Harps settled into the game and they almost broke the deadlock when a great through ball from Glenn Mc Court sent Kiefer Mc Cusker free down the right hand side but Caolan O’Donnell just failed to get a clean touch on his clever cut back to the back post.Mc Cusker’s pace and trickery down the right hand side were now causing Limavady all sorts of problems and it was his clever play that led to Harps thinking they had taken the lead just before halftime but Fleming’s well taken finish was flagged offside. googletag.cmd.push Second Half Minutes into the second half, Harps had cries for a penalty waved away after a late challenge sent Friel crashing to the ground as he was bearing down on goal. The young striker in disbelief at not being awarded a spot kick, although he wouldn’t have long to wait for his next opportunity. The decisive goal came moments later, Ollie Deery’s pinpoint pass sent Caolan O’Donnell away down the Harps’ left. O’Donnell’s clever footwork saw him lose his marker and drill a fine ball across the limavady goal to be met by the advancing Pearse Friel, his first time finish giving Brady in the Limavady goal no chance. With Limavady’s resistance finally broken, Harps pressed to put the game out of their reach. The woodwork came to Limavady’s rescue on two occasions as the Derry youngsters pressed for a second. Luke Mc Court was unfortunate to see his free kick from distance clip the top of the Limavady crossbar with the goalkeeper well beaten and Caolan O’Donnell was unlucky to see his exquisite strike from outside the box crash off the outside of the Limavady post.With the score line at ., Limavady knew they were still well in the tie. Their best chance to draw level came with only minutes remaining and they would have done sonot for the brilliance of Harps’ goalkeeper John Downey-Campbell. Some hesitation in the Harps’ defence allowed the Limavady striker time and space to run clear and fire off a powerful shot which was superbly blocked by the Harp’s netminder. As the loose ball spilled to an advancing Limavady player, Downey-Campbell did brilliantly to react quickly to the breaking ball, spreading himself well to force the on rushing player to fire over the bar.As the game drew to a close Limavady threw everything they had at Harps in an effort to force the game into extra time but they could find no way through. The Foyle Harps youngsters holding firm to book their place in the semi-finals. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy. One of her finely embroidered pieces hangs proudly in the nursesrsquo station at Spa Nursing Home.Some years ago, Jean visited northern France and sewed the magnicent medieval monastery of Mont-St-Michel, set in the bay of St Malo where Normandy and Brittany merge.She is also a keen local historian and is particularly knowledgable about Betsy Gray and the Battle of Ballynahinch in .Jean also enjoys John Wayne films, including Rio Bravo and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and the musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers which starred Howard Keel. She is also a great fan of country music legend Jim Reeves.Jean has been a resident at Spa Nursing Home for almost four years and son Malcolm says she could not he happier. ldquoThe staff are very good to her, he remarked..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call for investment in Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted at a meeting at Stormont last week.Fisheries minister Edwin Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the port, including deepening the harbour to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.The local politicians highlighted the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure and called for the port to receive its fair share of funding to enhance the fleet.Mr McGrath described Ardglass as a ldquostrategically important harbour for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish.The MLA said further investment was ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided to allow larger vessels to dock safely.ldquoSuch work should be undertaken in concert with efforts to expand Kilkeel harbour and ensure that our local fishing fleet is enhanced ahead of Brexit, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSouth Down has a proud association with the fishing industry. It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space.

discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was

Park.Philip Campbellrsquos side displayed a ruthless streak when they brushed aside their giantkilling neighbours to book their place in the Easter Monday showdown for the third year in a row and they can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

For winning rider, Daire McConville, from Portadown, it was an eighth winner between the flags.Twelve went to post in the Bluegrass and Dengie - mares maiden race and here we had a smooth winner in Ballela in the colours of Banbridge owner, Liam Cosgrove, who bought the horse back in August .Trained at Katesbridge by his brother, Gerry, the winner was ridden by Mark OrsquoHare in what was his only ride of the day.Going by Gerry, the winner, who likes any going, will now be sold.Interesting that Liam, who bred Apinchofluck, now owned and trained by Gerry Quinn, the former jockey, fell early in the race.Second place went to Mullaghmore Wave, trained by Alan Fleming, no longer the private trainer to Barry Connell, with Res Judicata third.Eleven went to post in the Irish National Hung chase committee six year-old and upwards maiden race for novice riders and here, Tardreee, in the colours of Templepatrick owner, Wilson Dennison, was sent into a long, clear lead and was always well clear as he came home by  s from Gigiplan Two Seven, ridden by Cathal McCormick, on his second local ride of the day.Red Lion, owned and trained by Co Antrimrsquos Richard Irwin was third. The winner is trained at the ownerrsquos estate by Colin McKeever and was ridden by Ballymenarsquos Paddy McGuigan for his second success. To me, he is a rider that deserves to get more rides than he does at at present.Largest field of the day was the  runner Albert Bartlett maiden race and as a result of a  start, all riders received a two-day ban.Victory went to Oscar Elite, trained in Wexford by Cormac Doyle and ridden by his stable jockey, James Hendrick, the combination winning from the Warren Ewing-owned and trained Here We Have it, ridden by Jordan Gainford, now riding the majority of his winners.There was a dead heat for third between Tommyrsquos Oscar and Pasvolsky, Chumlee and Dan Nevin were unlucky to be carried out by a posse horse when still in the lead.Six of the  entries went to post in the Dennison Commercials four year-olds auction race and only three finished, victory going to Greenrock Abbey, owned and trained by Wexfordrsquos Denis Murphy.Monkstreet was second ahead of Bolamore Bridge. No less than  horses took part in schooling after the last race.Among the best turned out in all races, courtesy of Glencairn Stables, were locals Robyn McCluskey, from Dromara and Sam Dickson, both involved with Colin McBratney yard at Raffrey. Acting stewards were Max and Margaret Ervine, James Armstrong and David Aiken..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Unveiling.jpg","title":"Unveiling of plaque commemorating Ballymote Centre founding member  ","story":"A PLAQUE has been unveiled at the Ballymote Centre in Downpatrick to honour the memory of a local man who played a key role in its success.Architect Ciaran Taggart was one of the Killough Road shopping and community centrersquos founding members.The plaque unveiled during a recent ceremony attended by his we, Mary, and family members.The wall plaque was formally unveiled by current Ballymote Centre chairman Pat Branf, who paid tribute to Mr Taggart, highlighting the key role he played alongside a number of others  years ago to open the facility.Mr Taggart mdash who lived at the Killough Road mdash was an active Ballymote board chairman until his death in June last year.Paying tribute to the founder member, Mr Branf said Mr Taggart gave of his time and helped create hundreds of jobs.ldquoCiaran identied the need for a community centre in what were very troubled times in the area and when poverty and social unrest were re, he continued.ldquoFrom the early s, Mr Ciaranrsquos talents and energy were vital to this area.

Ironically, the largest chunk of north-south co-operation took place in energy, even though there were no formal arrangements between Stormont and Dublin in this area. It was department to department and minister to minister only.Lord Empey \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...When I got my first day brief, I was advised that although energy was a departmental responsibility, I would not be troubled by it. How wrong they were.I can say that despite what officials said, I spent more time on energy than any other subject. At least I left something to show for it a new South-North gas pipeline, delivered under ministerial direction, the electricity interconnector, and a new efficient gas-fired power station in Londonderry replacing the inefficient clapped-out old oil-fired one at Coolkeeragh.I can say without hesitation, that the energy branch was the best in the department, headed up by Jim McKeown and the late Jack Beattie. We worked with the regulator, Douglas McIldoon, and did our best to extract our economy from the contracts which were entered into under direct rule and which give us the highest charges in the UK.When I read about the role of the dferent permanent secretaries, I was shocked. The goings on with some of the civil servants involved in RHI were unimaginable to me, even after nearly seven years as a minister. The department would have run me down for a box of paperclips, never mind the footloose and fancy-free manner in which things were handled.If I went to the loo there would have been a minute to that effect. They minuted everything. This was essential, as how  was the department at large to know what I wanted to achieve  The minutes were circulated to the relevant branch, and this was how my wishes were transmitted to the department.The only other way was to tell them verballyor for the permanent secretary to send out memos. This was essential for good governance but also for protecting the department.The one bit I don’t get in all of this is the role of the Department of Finance and Personnel . It has lines of expenditure on its forms each line has a number and projections. I understand how Annualy Managed Expendituremoney comes directly from the Treasury, rather than from Stormont’s budget, but even so, I don’t understand how and why it was not clear from the beginning where the money was coming from. That is usually ground zero for DFP.But the bigger picture is of course the culture that was around the politics of all of this. In my time in the Executive, it would be unheard of for a spad to come into another minister’s department without permission, let alone trying to overturn ministerial decisions, as has been alleged.Of course the DUP operated dferently, as did Sinn Fein. My party would never have any say in how I ran the department and no papers would go to the party.The sleekit way in which advisors leaked material to the press shocked even me.However, as Sam McBride concludes in his book Burned, it is unionism plc that is the real loser in all of this. As the man in the street looks in, what is the dference between what is alleged to have happened here and the Fianna Fail tent at the Galway races To see ministers like Jonathan Bell, someone totally out of his depth, running the place was disconcerting.It is hard to identy where Northern Ireland was benefiting from the ‘fill your boots’ mentality.I spent many years of my political le trying to get Stormont up and running.

A source has told the News Letter that was correct, although Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said that he has asked his civil servants not to show him the report until it is published.What do witnesses know about what is coming Those who will be signicantly criticised by the inquiry have known for months what is coming butare bound by strict confidentiality rules. From last July, the inquiry was writing to key witnesses to inform them of at least the outline of the findings against them. Witnesses were able to make submissions to the inquiry to dispute its findings, but those submissions will not be made public. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Will the inquiry lead to anyone being jailed The inquiry itself is purely about establishing facts and has no power to make findings of civil or criminal liability. However, the police and prosecutorial authorities can conduct their own investigations. A witnesses’ own evidence cannot be used against them in criminal proceedings or be relied upon in deciding whether to bring such proceedings against that person.However, that provision does not extend to documentation or other evidence obtained by the inquiry from other iniduals and which points towards criminality by a witness.Whata witness lied to the inquiry If anyone is to be prosecuted over the scandal, perhaps the most likely route is for a perjury-type offence or contempt proceedings –the inquiry believes it can prove that a witness has lied. That would involve a High Court trial. Perjury-type proceedings can only be instigated by or with the consent of the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland and carry a sentence of up to two years imprisonment and or an unlimited fine.Who paid witnesses’ legal bills Overwhelmingly it was the taxpayer. That will not be popular with many of the public but is based on the principle thatan inidual faces legal proceedings for actions stemming from time in employment then that employer should stand behind them . Several other witnesses have their legal bills paid for from public funds because they are private iniduals who got tangled up in the story and it is judged in the public interest that they receive legal advice.Why is the report being released on a Friday afternoon ahead of a bank holiday weekend Many people are cynical about the publication of such an important inquiry in a traditional slot to ‘bury bad news’. Sir Patrick Coghlin has been fiercely independent throughout and there is no suggestion that he has been steered to this time. He always made clear that he would publish the report at the earliest opportunity when it was complete rather than holding it back. One reason given for the Friday publication date is that the inquiry wanted to use Parliament Buildings. Use of the buildings is ultimately controlled by the political parties, giving them a potentially indirect role in at least the day of publication.Why have civil servants not been disciplined The civil service had not completed – or in many cases, even started – disciplinary proceedings against any civil servant at the time when the public inquiry was called. The civil service argued that it would be unfair to run disciplinary proceedings in tandem in the inquiry and so therefore they were put on hold until the inquiry reports.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid.

It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
