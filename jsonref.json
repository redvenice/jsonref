Last night, the PM said he had raised human rights with the leader.But he added: \u0027We also talked about what we can do to stabilise oil prices, to fight inflation, to help consumers, to help people at the gas pumps, at the petrol pumps, and a lot of agreement that it is important to avoid inflation, to avoid the damaging economic consequences, agreement that we need to work together to bring peace to Ukraine.\u0027The PM was asked whether states like Saudi Arabia who are members of the oil producers\u0027 cartel Opec understood the importance of increasing supplies at a time when the West is trying to wean itself off Russian oil and gas.He replied: \u0027There\u0027s an interest for Saudi Arabia, for all oil-producing and exporting countries, in making sure that the global economy is not damaged by the current spikes, that we don\u0027t get the kind of inflation that we saw in the 1970s, we don\u0027t see the stagflation. So it was a very productive conversation.\u0027But pressed on if he had won a decision on increasing supply to reduce the shock of the West moving away from Russian fuel, he said: \u0027I think you need to talk to the Saudis about that.\u0027Mr Johnson, who shook hands with the Saudi crown prince accused of ordering the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, insisted closer ties with the kingdom did not mean \u0027we can\u0027t stick to our principles\u0027.At his first stop in Abu Dhabi, where he met UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Mr Johnson pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a £1billion investment in green aviation fuel in Teesside.\u0027That\u0027s the kind of thing we want to encourage - doesn\u0027t in any way mean we can\u0027t stick to our principles and raise those issues that we all care about.\u0027Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of \u0027going cap in hand from dictator to dictator\u0027, which he said was \u0027not an energy strategy\u0027. But he stopped short of saying Labour would boycott Saudi oil.Maya Foa, director of human rights advocacy group Reprieve, said the Saudis\u0027 decision to execute three people while Mr Johnson was visiting was a \u0027provocative act, designed to flaunt the crown prince\u0027s power and impunity to the world\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Russian broadcaster RT s UK licence revoked Ofcom","story":"Share this article Alex Salmond, former First Minister of Scotland, later suspended his talk show after viewers criticised his decision to work with the controversial broadcaster.Mr Salmond had continued broadcasting on the maligned channel right up until Putin launched a full-scale invasion.A statement from the politician released to the media said his show featuring the interview with Vince Cable would be the last until hostilities between Russia and Ukraine come to an end.Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon had said she was \u0027appalled\u0027 at her predecessor Alex Salmond\u0027s involvement with RT. Social media platforms were quick to distance themselves from RT in the wake of Putin\u0027s illegal invasion, with YouTube and Facebook banning access to all RT and Sputnik channels across Europe. Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: \u0027Freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high.\u0027Following an independent regulatory process, we have today found that RT is not fit and proper to hold a licence in the UK.\u0027As a result we have revoked RT\u0027s UK broadcasting licence.\u0027 RT, previously known as Russia Today, is a Russian state-backed news channel, based in the UK.Launched in 2014, it is funded by the federal tax budget of the Russian government.It closed for TV broadcasting on 30 July 2021.

Spurs came through the midweek win at Brighton unscathed and Antonio Conte is likely to name an unchanged side. Japhet Tanganga (knee) has been ruled out for the season, Oliver Skipp (groin) will return after the international break while Ryan Sessegnon (hamstring) is at least four weeks away from a return to training.

I shall hand you back to my esteemed colleague David Tindall. Bye!But Conte said the Spaniard had no right to complain given the Gunners called off the north London derby in January, despite having only one confirmed case of coronavirus. The Premier League changed the rules regarding fixture postponements in the wake of that incident.  Allan was sent off in the dramatic late win over Newcastle on Thursday night after Craig Pawson was advised to view the monitor and subsequently upgraded his yellow card to a red for the Brazilian’s tackle on Allan Saint-Maximin. Everton have lodged an appeal against that decision and even if it is unsuccessful they will then appeal against the severity of the three-match ban.  “It’s hard to say how hopeful we are,” said Lampard on the appeal. “We had a really bad decision against us which we had an apology for but apologies don’t mean points. There was nothing from that other than a ‘Thanks very much’. This one there is no need for an apology. It wasn’t a decision that should have been changed to a red card. It was very clear from my end. In the cold light of day that is not a red card and we don’t want to lose Allan for three games and now we are in their (an independent disciplinary panel) hands. With hindsight look at the decision and was it enough to warrant a red card? For me it wasn’t.” (PA Media)“I think I’ve broken a bone in my hand,” he said. “After the goal I realised ... but for the three points we got, not a problem. I won’t complain too much.” City may be chasing glory in the Premier League and the Champions League but Guardiola has no concerns that intensity might drop for Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final at Southampton. He said: “We play every game like it’s the last game of our lives. I know how difficult it will be away at Southampton but I trust a lot in my team, my players.” (PA Media) Arsenal have improved markedly under Mikel Arteta this season but the Spaniard, 39, was under pressure after they started the season with three straight league defeats. “Mikel has done a fantastic job and really found that consistency that Arsenal have been looking for so credit to him for that,” he said. “He’s come through a couple of periods where the pressure was on him and his team and you’ve got to give people at Arsenal credit for backing him.” (PA Media)AC Milan must take one game at a time and have their wits about them when they face relegation-threatened Cagliari on Saturday, coach Stefano Pioli said, as his side continue their quest for their first Serie A title since 2011. Milan, top on 63 points, are three points ahead of second-placed Napoli and four ahead of defending champions Internazionale, who are third with one game in hand.  While Cagliari are hovering above the relegation zone, Pioli stressed that they would make for difficult opponents, as Milan are looking to extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 10.

Chelsea’s suitors have until end of business on Friday to submit bids after Roman Abramovich put the club up for sale. “I’m absolutely not involved, zero. I’m informed from time to time, but we have a pretty tight schedule so I’m happy not to be informed of every little step and chance in the process. “Because that gives me also the advantage to focus on football and the staff here, the environment I can influence, the 60 to 80 people here at Cobham. “So of course I’m informed but not asked and it’s also not necessary, it’s not my job and not my role. Everybody hopes it will be completed quickly. And as I understand the hope is and we can trust this is maybe solved quicker than usual. “But it makes not so much sense to reflect how it would change with the role of a new owner, because the new owner is not here, the ideas are not set out. “We don’t know what’s coming, so let’s cross the river when we are at the bridge. And right now we are not at the bridge.”Meet the teams: BodøGlimt, Feyenoord, Leicester City, Marseille, PAOK, PSV Eindhoven, Roma, Slavia Prague.In the Europa League, Barcelona are the 74 favourites, with West Ham 61 and Rangers 141.SF1: Leipzig or Atalanta v Braga or RangersSF2: West Ham or Lyon v Eintracht Frankfurt or Barcelona The winners of SF2 will be the ‘home’ team in the final.The Champions League holders take on the kings of the competition in the quarter-finals. Real Madrid have been crowned continental champions on a record 13 occasions, currently sit atop of LaLiga and secured this tie by knocking out star-studded Paris St Germain in stunning fashion. Having lost 1-0 in France and gone down further to another Kylian Mbappe goal in the second leg, Karim Benzema’s hat-trick secured a remarkable comeback and 3-2 aggregate triumph. The three-time competition runners-up return to Manchester for a fascinating clash against Manchester City in the final eight. Diego Simeone’s men won LaLiga last season but have long since been out of the title race this time around, although they have picked up form of late and managed to knock out Manchester United in the last 16. Wily, well-drilled Atleti followed up a 1-1 first-leg draw in Spain by securing a 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday as the hosts were stifled. Having surprisingly emerged from a group including Bayern Munich and Barcelona, caretaker boss Nelson Verissimo masterminded a memorable last-16 win against Ajax. The sides drew 2-2 in the first leg in Lisbon and Benfica dug deep in Amsterdam to eke out a 1-0 triumph through Darwin Nunez’s late header. The Uruguay international is the star of a side enjoying a fine Champions League run during a season when their Primeira Liga hopes are already over.Memories of Howard Gayle, Ray Kennedy and Alan Kennedy. Liverpool also won the League Cup in 1981. It’s clearly in the stars. Russia appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and asked that the suspension be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. However, CAS announced on Friday that the Russian request for a stay had been rejected and that the suspension remained in force. Russia were due to compete in the World Cup play-offs later this month, but with no date fixed for the appeal to be heard it would seem that they are out of contention for the finals.

I’ve been on the wrong side of photo finishes the last couple of years so it’s so good to be on the right side of one.”The second running of this Grade Two contest, which produced a thrilling finish 12 months ago as Colreevy got up in the final 50 yards to beat Elimay, the likely favourite today. She is one of just three runners at single-figure odds and with Concertista giving weight to the other two, Elimay and Mount Ida, who took the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir here last year, are probably the ones to focus on. Mount Ida actually gave Elimay 3lb and a half-length beating at Fairyhouse earlier this season, but she has a well-known tendency to jump to her right, which can be a big issue around a left-handed track like Cheltenham. She got away with it 12 months ago but this is a different test and Elimay is probably the way to go. The Foxhunters in old money gets underway, the amateur jockeys getting their turn. There is a slight delay, as there is a straggler who makes his way to the back of the field, Don Bersy. There are 21 jumps in this one and Don Bersy takes to the front, and goes five lengths clear as they go past the stands. Billaway, for whom a win would be very bad news for the bookies, is ahead of mid-ision. Winged Leader is up there, too with still 14 to jump. Bob And Co goes, shipping off David Maxwell as Don Bersy continues to lead. Premier Magic is pulled up at the back of the field. Billaway up in sixth as they again go past the stands, and the coach parks. Don Bersy loses the lead to Winged Leader with a missed jump, and then another before being pulled up. Winged Leader is clear of Dubai Quest. Billaway is well off the pace and the bookies can breathe easy. Winged Leader and Mighty Stowaway go at it, Billaway closes, six lengths back. Winged Leader keeps going up ahead, Billaway storms home and takes it....that’s the bookies beaten, what a surge, Winged Leader just ran out of puff, oh so tired. Another Mullins win. What is still known to most of us as the Fox Hunters’, despite the decision to remove Reynard from the title last year, is one of the Festival’s oldest events, and pretty much the only one these days that is ever likely to be won by a tiny yard from the back of beyond. Porlock Bay, last year’s 80-1 winner, was a prime example, but even here, the big operations are slowly moving in and Willie Mullins’s Billaway is expected to head the market for the third year running, having found one opponent too good in both 2020 and 2021. The eight-year-old looks to be in his prime this time around, bolted up in his trial at Naas in February and has Patrick Mullins is back in his saddle after amateurs were banned from taking part last year. He will take all the beating, but Winged Leader’s connections will hope for a repeat of their horse’s 12-length defeat of Billaway in January, when Mullins’s runner was coming back from a nine-month break and probably needed the race much more than the winner. Bob And Co, whose trainer Paul Nicholls has won this four times since 2004, also has live claims for the Corinthian ownerrider David Maxwell. Chantry House is an early struggler, as Aye Right, the outsider, leads the field. Royal Pagaille looks keen as they go to 13 out, but it’s a tight bunch as they go past the main stand to quite a noise. Asterion Forlonge’s jumping is still not straight but all are up and doing with eight fences to jump. Minella Indo prepares to move. This could be a tactical one. Plenty of chances to go with six to jump. The starter, Robbie Supple, sends them away and Tornado Flyer is one of the first to show but then makes a mistake at the first. Santini sits in second over the second. Tornado Flyer drops to the back. Asterion Forlonge jumps left, causing a traffic problem and Protektorat struggles at the next. A Plus Tard is next to not look so good over a fence.  Some Gold Cups revolve around a hot favourite, a horse like Kauto Star or Best Mate who ranks among the all-time greats, while others – like this year’s renewal – are wide-open and could conceivably be won by eight or nine of the runners. Some might argue that a superstar like Best Mate is the best possible advert for jump racing, but from a punter’s point of view, getting four or five times your money back for finding the winner is great PR too and personally, I’ll take an open Gold Cup every time. Galvin has been eased out of top spot in the betting this morning by A Plus Tard, no doubt because Rachael Blackmore will be trying to go one better than last year on Henry de Bromhead’s gelding. He needs to find one-and-a-quarter lengths to get the better of his stable companion and last year’s winner, Minella Indo, and looked like an improved performer when running away with the Betfair Chase at Haydock Park in October. He has since been narrowly beaten by Galvin in the Savills Chase at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting, but the stable’s form was in a trough at the time and Blackmore, feels she went for home a little too soon, allowing Galvin’s deep reserves of stamina to come into play as he stayed on strongly to edge them out on the line. There has also been some money for Al Boum Photo, third last year and the winner for the two preceding renewals, and Tornado Flyer, another Willie Mullins-trained runner who sprang a surprise in the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, while Protektorat, the leading British-trained contender for a race that has gone Ireland’s way in five of the last six seasons, is on the slide. He put up a mighty effort under top weight in the Paddy Power Gold Cup in November and seemed to improve for the step up in trip when successful on heavy ground over three miles at Aintree in December. He is no forlorn each-way hope, but for win purposes, Minella Indo’s course form and habit of blossoming in the spring makes him the pick of the prices for me at around 6-1 and I’ll be hoping to see him give Robbie Power a second win in this race after Sizing John’s triumph in 2016.  Over this long trip they go, the last race before the big one. It’s very loud out on the course, says ITV’s Luke Harvey. It really is a big crowd today. El banter will be flowing aplenty. They go off with Ginto and Hillcrest as joint favs but there’s a false start after a very long prelim. They go off with something of a jolt and set off at one hell of a rate. Classic Getaway lives up to his name by going to the front of the field. Hill Crest doesn’t jump too well over the third, and he’s labouring a tad. Minella Cocooner is pushing them on, and the two Mullins horses in the pack are caught a little off guard. Stag Horn and Classic Getaway still lead. Cheers as they go past the stands, Ginto in fifth and sitting relatively pretty. Minella Cocooner takes it right up, speeding along in his classic style and he nearly comes a cropper. Hill Crest still slow in the pack with three to jump. Hill Crest is pulled up and so is Classic Getaway. The pace has been heavy. Down the hill they go to the second last with Minella Cocooner leading. Ballygriffin Cottage coming from deep. Ginto...oh no, he’s gone wrong. Minella Cocooner and the Nice Guy going to the last and the Nice Guy who will win from Minella Cocooner. It’s a Mullins 1-2, but maybe not the Mullins we expected. Two of the outsiders – Falcon Eight and The Real Whacker – are non-runners but there is still a big field of 17 runners for the Festival’s three-mile novice hurdle, a race that includes the future Gold Cup winners Minella Indo and Bobs Worth on its roll of honour. It has also seen several shocks over the years – only one of the last eight winners has started at a single-figure price – probably because it is a very different test to anything the runners have faced before, not just in terms of the trip but also, crucially, the unrelenting pace from the off. Hillcrest, who might well have a flawless 5-5 record had he not unseated his rider when a rival fell in front of him at Cheltenham in January, has replaced Ginto as favourite this morning, with punters perhaps feeling that Ginto would have been Gordon Elliott’s second-string had the ante-post favourite, Minella Crooner, not been scratched due to injury last week. That was a big disappointment, but it did at least avoid any watch-your-bets confusion with Minella Cocooner, a Grade One winner last time for Willie Mullins. Looking beyond the market leaders, John McConnell’s Bardenstown Lad looks the type to outrun his price of around 16-1. He was sent over for a three-mile novice on the Old course at the October meeting here, then put away until his Festival prep at Musselburgh in early February. He has bags of stamina, seems certain to relish this test and looks a fair each-way bet with many bookies offering five places. The horses take a slow walk to the line as State Man goes to 114 as they get underway over the eight hurdles. State Man looks keen on the outside inthe early stages, Stepney Causeway in the lead almost goes over but rights himself as they surge past the Best Mate stand and the coach park. Tritonic is up there. Stepney Causeway leads as they go past halfway. State Man still making no significant move from midfield where he is with West Cork. Two to clear but a long way to go, and Cask Mate goes over. Surprise Package and State Man go as they go to the last. State Man goes to the front at the last and speeds to the line. Another win for Mullins and Townend, First Street in second, Colonel Mustard in third, West Cork in fourth. Two Mullins favourites go in in the first two races.  The image of Suprise Package cantering all over his rivals in last Saturday’s Imperial Cup is fresh in the memory here, and any one of the 18 – yes, 18 – Irish-trained runners in the 26-strong field could easily find a stone or more and do something similar here. In fact, a dozen of them probably could and still not finish in the frame, such is the nature of this race now with potentially high-class novices replacing the hardened two-mile handicap hurdlers of yesteryear in the field. Suprise Package will pick up a £50,000 bonus if he follows up here, while Cormier, a winner at Musselburgh’s valuable recent meeting, is chasing a £100,000 bonus for a win. State Man, the likely favourite, is one of the most unexposed runners in the field, fell two out when odds-on – and looking the likely winner – for his Irish debut in December and then hosed up in a maiden hurdle at Limerick. He could prove to be 20lb well in, but he has a similar profile to Gaelic Warrior, who was beaten at very short odds in Tuesday’s Fred Winter, and there are each-way alternatives aplenty. West Cork, whose trainer, Dan Skelton, has won this three times since 2016, won the Greatwood Hurdle over the Old course here in November and has been put away since a good run at Ascot in December, but the less-exposed I Like To Move It, touched off in the ultra-competitive Betfair Hurdle last time, makes slightly more appeal for me as his recent form is stronger and he has only just five runs over hurdles behind him. Rich Ricci, the owner of Vauban, told the BBC: ““He is a proper little taxi. He is a lovely horse. He’s got some engine and I am delighted with that.” The Triumph Hurdle is a much classier race now that the Fred Winter has arrived as an alternative attraction for the juveniles. Whether it is a better race is a matter of opinion, as there was something about the sight of 28 hurdlers careering around the New course at the top of the Gold Cup card which made finding the winner a particular pleasure. Anyway, those days are gone, but there have still been a few double-figure winners in recent years and while the ones at the top of the market have all put up solid trials, a horse like Il Etait Temps, who was pitched straight into Grade One company for his hurdling debut at the Dublin Racing Festival, could easily improve past them. He was just six lengths behind Vauban, today’s favourite, there, although Paul Townend has opted for Vauban and that must count for something. Pied Piper, who was sent over to Cheltenham by Gordon Elliott for the Triumph Trial over course and distance in January, is also a live contender and his form there was backed up by a good time, even though he crossed the line on a tight rein. At the prices, though, I’ll take a chance on the leading British juvenile, Knight Salute, who has done nothing but improve since being switched to hurdling from the Flat this season. He remains unbeaten after five starts, put up his best performance yet to win the Adonis at Kempton in a strong time and has perhaps been slightly overlooked in the market as Milton Harris, his trainer, is hardly a household name.  Ten years ago, Synchronised was the winner, ridden by AP McCoy and trained by Jonjo O’Neill.  Fifteen years ago, Kauto Star won the first of his two Gold Cups, ridden by Ruby Walsh and trained by Paul Nicholls.  Twenty years ago, it was Best Mate who won the first of his three Gold Cups, ridden by Jim Culloty and trained by Henrietta Knight.  Twenty-five years ago, it was Mr Mulligan, ridden by AP McCoy and trained by Noel Chance. It’s been a great three days’ racing with yesterday no exception with that Stayers’ Hurdle win for Flooring Porter, and the brilliance of Allaho in the Ryanair Chase. Perhaps though Thursday will be best recalled for Galopin Des Champs’s fall in the novice chase at the start of the day. He’ll be back, hopefully, and perhaps in next year’s Gold Cup. This year’s looks a highly open race, with defending champion Minella Indo standing his ground, A Plus Tard trying to go one better than last year, Al Boum Photo trying to win a third Gold Cup. and Galvin carrying the hopes of many a shrewdie from Ireland. There’s also a classic Venetia Williams plot in Royale Pagaille, who ran in last year’s race as a novice and suffered some poor luck in running.  And before and after that, too, more top-level National Hunt racing, and here to guide you through them.  Jon Pullin, the clerk of the course reported this morning that the going has improved to good-to-soft, soft in places, which is just about perfect jump racing ground but could mean that Galvin’s bottomless stamina is not quite as significant as it might have been. “We had a dry day yesterday so the ground’s dried up a bit,” Pullin said. “We’ve got a dry day ahead with bright sunshine and temperatures around 14 or 15C.”  Galvin was the narrow favourite for the Gold Cup yesterday evening but as expected, the money has started to arrive for Rachael Blackmore’s mount, A Plus Tard, and he now heads the market at 11-4 with Galvin, a proven stayer who won the three-and-three-quarter mile National Hunt Chase here last season, out to 4-1 and Minella Indo - last year’s Gold Cup winner and the horse that Blackmore rejected – on offer at around 6-1.  That’s the pick of the prices for me, given Minella Indo’s exceptional record at this track, with two Festival wins already, and I’m willing to overlook his patchy record since last year’s victory as his win 12 months ago remains the best piece of form on offer and he seems to come alive in the spring. Protektorat is the shortest-priced runner from a British yard and a win for Dan Skelton’s runner would round off a much better week than anticipated for the home team.  The card is under way at 1.30pm with the Triumph Hurdle, while Paul Townend goes into the final afternoon with a one-win lead in the race to be leading rider. He has three winners this week, while Blackmore, Nico de Boinville and Patrick Mullins all have two.  Willie Mullins, meanwhile, looks home and hosed in the trainers’ race with five wins, three more than Gordon Elliott, Nicky Henderson, Henry de Bromhead and Venetia Williams, but Elliott in particular has several well-fancied runners today and could yet make a race of it should either Pied Piper or Fil Dor land the opener.  The last of the mist has just left the top of Cleeve Hill, and a wonderful afternoon of racing awaits.

Events include ceol agus craic at the 3,000 capacity outdoor main stage, craic comedy tent, a story yurt, performance spaces, relaxation areas and an Irish food and craft village. Traders association Dublin Town said the first St Patrick’s Day parade in the city since 2019 seemed to attract more visitors from overseas, with Irish people still seemingly down in numbers. But overall footfall monitored by a network of cameras in the streets was 470,000 – above the 423,000 figure for 2019. Dublin Town which sends camera data to the UK for conversion into anonymised numbers of people said the result was that some 315,000 people were on the streets, slightly higher than the 300,000 for 2019. The Garda said there had been no incidents of significant anti-social behaviour during the day and into the evening. Richard Guiney of Dublin Town said the event was good natured with a lot of overseas visitors. While numbers were higher than 2019 Mr Guiney said he recalled 2019 as being “very cold” . He noted a large number of American accents which he said was a positive sign that US visitors who spend heavily and stay longer were travelling to Ireland once again. He also said the number of Scottish people in the city was remarkable, judging from the numbers of kilts visible. The Scottish would be staying for the Ireland-Scotland rugby match on Saturday and were welcome, he added. St Patrick’s Day was only the second day since the pandemic began that footfall in the capital had exceed corresponding levels in 2019, said Mr Guiney. He expects further improvement, particularly when more office workers return to their city desks. Being IrishAnna McGowan, interim director at the St Patrick’s Festival, said the festival parade “ reminded us all just how important it is to celebrate being Irish no matter where in the world we may be”.Fáilte Ireland chief executive Paul Kellysaid the parade and events over the bank holiday weekend showcase Ireland “as a fantastic tourist destination to people around the world. Festivals and events play a key role . . . supporting jobs and revenue generation.”From 6pm each evening, Festival Quarter by Night is reserved for adults only. Organisers promise “ the very best in Irish entertainment from music to comedy and all that’s in between”. Taking to the stages throughout the festival are singer-songwriter Damien Dempsey alongside Kevin Mc Gahern, Emma Doran and Neil Delamare.

In their opening remarks, the two men said they would discuss the war in Ukraine, as well as Northern Ireland. Video: ReutersUS President Joe Biden meets virtually with Micheál Martin in the Oval Office on Thursday. Photograph: by Nicholas Kamm  AFP via Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has paid tribute to Ireland’s efforts to accept Ukrainian refugees, describing it as “amazing”.Speaking to Taoiseach Micheál Martin in a virtual bilateral meeting this afternoon, Mr Biden said: “What Ireland is doing now taking in Ukrainian refugees speaks so loudly about your principles . . . It’s amazing and I want to publicly compliment you for it. Thank you. Thank you.”The meeting is taking place virtually after the Taoiseach tested positive for Covid-19 last night, leading to the cancellation of his attendance at today’s St Patrick’s Day events in Washington.It is expected that the Taoiseach will have to remain in the US for the next 10 days, as US regulations prohibit international travel for that period following a positive test.This will mean that Mr Martin will miss next week’s European Council summit in Brussels. In opening remarks, the two men said they would discuss the war in Ukraine, as well as Northern Ireland and other issues. Mr Martin commended President Biden for his leadership of what he described as the “like minded democracies” who had banded together to oppose Russia’s “barbaric attack on the citizens of Ukraine”. He said that Ireland supports the “broadest and widest sanctions as possible”, and said it was “extremely important that we keep this unity of purpose” in seeking to end the “unjustifiable and immoral war”.He said that Russia’s invasion was inflicting “terrible trauma on the children of Ukraine and their mothers”.‘Unequivocal support’In his opening remarks President Biden also reiterated his administration’s “unequivocal support” for the Belfast Agreement. “I’ve made that clear as you probably heard to the prime minister,” he said. “Too much blood, sweat and tears have been shed to get that done, and this is no time to change it.”Later President Biden returned to the same themes when he addressed the Friends of Ireland lunch on Capitol Hill, hosted by Ms Pelosi and attended by the members of the powerful cross-party group. He said that the Belfast Agreement was “truly, truly, truly, truly supported” in the US. “We insist that it be maintained,” he said, to applause.Mr Biden also said that Ireland was “stepping up” in the efforts to isolate Russia and its “murderous dictator, a pure thug, who is waging an immoral war against the Ukraine”. “The Republic is paying a big price for supporting the sanctions,” he said.The President again paid effusive tribute to Ireland and the Irish-American relationship which he said was “more intense than ever before”.In a brief statement issued after the meeting, the Taoiseach’s spokesman said that two men had spoken about “the economy, Brexit and the belfast Agreement, the situation in Ukraine, the undocumented Irish” and that Mr Martin had reiterated the invitation to Mr Biden to visit Ireland.The Taoiseach said he was “feeling good” after his positive Covid test, which he said illustrated the benefit of vaccines. He said the cancellation of the in-person meeting was “unfortunate, but no more than that”. The Taoiseach is isolating at Blair House, a guesthouse for visiting leaders across the road from the White House. He quickly left the Ireland Funds gala dinner on Wednesday night after receiving news of his positive test. Mr Martin had earlier tested negative in routine tests but was retested when a member of the Irish delegation returned a positive result. Officials scrambled throughout the night to save as much of the day’s programme as possible. The St Patrick’s Day lunch on Capitol Hill with Congressional leaders and the White House reception this evening are expected to go ahead, but without Mr Martin.Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said she was “very, very sad” that the Taoiseach would not be joining members of Congress and President Biden for the Friends of Ireland lunch. Ms Pelosi, who sat with the Taoiseach before he left the dinner last night, said she was testing regularly and following medical advice.Meanwhile, President Michael D. Higgins issued a statement sending his good wishes to the Taoiseach after having heard of his positive Covid-19 test.“The Taoiseach has had a gruelling schedule working for our country over recent weeks,” he said. “I know that this work is continuing as he takes the necessary steps following his positive test. I wish the Taoiseach a speedy recovery and also wish him further success with the continuation of his programme in Washington, and in overcoming the necessary constraints involved.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics lionel barber on putin and how the west should deal with him","story":"As Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine enters its fourth week, with little sign of an outcome, the question of what an endgame of this war might look like is increasingly the subject of international debate.

Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: China and US must end war together, Xi Jinping tells Joe BidenHundreds remain trapped under rubble of Mariupol theatreFour years late and a decade in the making, Nasa’s ‘mega moon’ rocket ready for test flightSarah Everard killer Wayne Couzens charged with four counts of indecent exposureVictory ‘V’ signs and insults for Russians: How Mykolaiv’s governor is rallying residentsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"does pro putin tv host defend indefensible","story":"Evgeny Popov, 43, has hosted Russia’s top-rated politics talk show 60 Minut on the State-controlled Rossiya 1 channel since 2016. He co-anchors the show with his wife Olga Skabeeva, who has been nicknamed ‘Putin’s Iron Doll’ by opposition media for her vigorous defence of the Kremlin’s party line. Popov and Skabeeva’s show is one of the mainstays of the Kremlin’s media machine. Popov is also a member of the Duma for Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party. Among 60 Minut’s more outlandish claims over the years have been Skabeeva’s insistence that the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury was “an elaborate British plot to smear Russia” that Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Donbas in 2014 by a Ukrainian jet and that a “genocide” has been going on against Russian speakers in Ukraine since a “fascist” government came to power in Kiev after 2014’s Maidan revolution, which is mentioned on almost every show. Between 2016 and 2018 I appeared as a guest on 60 Minut dozens of times to comment on world events from the point of view of a Western correspondent. The show went out live to over 15 million viewers across Russia. Though I was never told what I could and could not say, I was rarely allowed to speak for more than thirty seconds before being shouted down by other studio guests, who usually included Duma members, ministers, senators and senior Kremlin advisers. On one memorable occasion ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, spitting with fury, screamed that I should be “sent to the Gulag” for daring to say that only half a dozen countries around the world had recognised Putin’s annexation of Crimea.  On Monday, Russian State TV news producer Marina Ovsyannikova protested against the war by interrupting a live broadcast of the Vremya evening news show, carrying a placard warning viewers that “they are lying to you!” I called Popov to ask whether the outbreak of war had changed his attitude to the Kremlin’s media messaging. Here’s our conversation:Owen Matthews: What did you think about Ovsyannikova’s protest? Evgeny Popov: “I don’t want to talk about that. I don’t consider it a big deal. I don’t want to draw attention to it.” OM: One of the last times we met on your show I asked you whether you really believed in the message you were broadcasting. You answered that you were a journalist and it wasn’t your job to believe or not – and that you just transmitted what your reporters filed. And you asked me if I believed everything I read and saw in Western media. So I wanted to ask you if anything has changed in your attitude to your news product since the beginning of the war? OM: Evgeny, that was widely reported. OM: That’s been a convention for decades. EP: “What’s the difference? It’s officially forbidden. There is military censorship in the USA when it’s at war. And for all my personal respect for you, Owen, I know that you will not report what I’m saying to you. You’ll just tear out some phrases and quote them out of context. That’s why I didn’t want to talk about this.” OM: The point of my getting in touch was to get your side of the story. EP: “My point of view is very simple. Your media have dumped a storm of hatred on Russia – and in doing so you have buried the very idea of professional journalism.

However, it will have three “astronauts” on board, in the form of mannequins which will collect radiation data.The second stage, Artemis 2, is due for launch in 2024 and will see astronauts return to the Moon’s orbit, similar to Apollo 8.The full touchdown, Artemis 3, will happen in 2025, with astronauts either travelling straight from the spacecraft to the Moon’s surface, or by docking at the Lunar Gateway space station and descending from there.Although slightly smaller than the 363ft Saturn V rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), a super heavy-lift launch vehicle used to send the Orion spacecraft and astronauts to the moon, has 15 per cent more thrust and will be the world’s most powerful rocket when it launches.The spacecraft has two more weeks of checks ahead of the “wet dress rehearsal” on April 3 when the rocket will be fuelled with 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant.A full launch programme will take place, but will stop 10 seconds before blast off.The SLS will take the Orion spacecraft into low Earth orbit before the spacecraft detaches and travels 40,000 miles beyond the moon, further than any spaceship carrying humans has ventured.It will also deploy 10 small satellites to gather information about the deep space environment before the crew module returns to Earth.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: China and US must end war together, Xi Jinping tells Joe BidenHundreds remain trapped under rubble of Mariupol theatreSarah Everard killer Wayne Couzens charged with four counts of indecent exposureVictory ‘V’ signs and insults for Russians: How Mykolaiv’s governor is rallying residentsAlex Salmond tight-lipped on future of Russia Today show as channel stripped of licenceMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should have paid debt iran long time ago","story":"Until Iran’s Islamic Revolution swept the Shah from power in early 1979, Iran had rich pickings for the United Kingdom. Replete with oil revenues, the country was a key UK market, not least for its arms manufacturers. From 1971, International Military Services (IMS), a company wholly owned by the British Ministry of Defence, negotiated the sale of around 1,750 Chieftain tanks and armoured vehicles to Iran. The cost was paid upfront.Around 185 tanks were delivered before the Shah fell, but as relations with the new Islamic government deteriorated, the British Government cancelled the contract. There was however no repayment by the British government for the tanks which could no longer be delivered. To add insult to injury, some of these tanks were then sold to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, which had just embarked on an unprovoked war against Iran.The West, and the Soviet Union, all supported Iraq in this war, praying that Saddam would rid them of this fanatical Islamist regime. (The only reliable Western supplier of arms to Iran was Israel, who regarded Saddam as the greater threat.) I was the first British foreign secretary to visit Iran after 1979. I had intensive discussions with them throughout my five years in office. I recall seeing some papers about the tanks’ debt, but I was unable to unearth any of them when researching my book on Britain and Iran. My recollection is that they were simply reporting that there was arbitration on the precise sum we owed. I dearly wish I’d known more then. No sanctions were in place which would have complicated repayment of the debt.But it’s clear to me now that IMS, and their owner, the MoD, were playing this very close to their chest. For reasons I have never understood, they placed one spurious legal hurdle after another in the way of a settlement. This has ratcheted up legal fees for both sides, at a cost to the British government of tens of millions of pounds.In 2013, the British government agreed that three Iranian officials could travel to London to negotiate the repayment of the debt. Diplomatic relations had been seriously disrupted by the sacking of our Tehran Embassy in November 2011 by the basiij (thugs attached to the Revolutionary Guards), so UK visas could not be issued in Tehran, but these officials were given visas by our Istanbul Consulate.When this delegation arrived at Heathrow, however, there was no FCO or MoD welcoming party to meet them. They were instead arrested, detained in a UK Detention Centre, and deported a few days later.Ben Wallace, now Defence Secretary, then co-chairman with me of the British Iranian All-Party Parliamentary Group, told the Commons that Britain’s dealings with this issue had been marred by double-dealing and obfuscation. In a letter to me, Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed regret for what had happened. I doubt the FCO knew in advance about this unlawful, calculated decision to disrupt any chance of agreement. But the Home Office certainly knew and had ordered this intervention, with little care for its consequences.Surprisingly, the Iranians made very little public fuss about the way their officials were treated. But the saga would have led to powerful elements inside the Islamic regime deciding that they would need to take more direct action to obtain repayment of the debt.Poor Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe became the victim – and the hostage. She was arrested on trumped-up charges and imprisoned for years in harsh conditions. She has now been able to rejoin her family in the UK, but only after the tanks’ debt was paid. The Iranians’ resort to hostage-taking is outrageous in any circumstances. I make no excuse whatever for their behaviour. But at least for the last decade we have played into the hands of the Revolutionary Guards. Boris Johnson then compounded Nazanin’s plight, and sentence, by busking before a Select Committee rather than reading his brief, inventing that Nazanin had been in Iran to train journalists, when in fact she’d gone to see her family.If we had not  ill-treated Iran’s officials, it’s still possible that the Revolutionary Guards would have arrested Nazanin on some other pretext. But had they done so, the UK would not have been on the backfoot, as it has been throughout Nazanin’s incarceration.Jack Straw was UK foreign secretary between 2001 and 2006.

He should tell that to the sacked workers at PO Ferries, writes the Mirrors Jason BeattiePO sacked all  staff via a pre-recorded video message Image: BBC SOUTH EASTopinionByJason BeattieHead of politics:,  Mar |commentsIn a speech last month Rishi Sunak claimed that markets were a moral force for good. He should tell that to the workers at PO Ferries. They will want to know what is moral about bosses sacking hundreds of staff by Zoom with immediate notice, or about the UKaposs feeble employment laws, which allow their jobs to be replaced by cheaper labour. And what is moral about their Dubai-based parent company, DP World, making people redundant despite reaping the benefits of the UK furlough scheme.This is a firm that has spent more than £million sponsoring the European Golf Tour and Renaultaposs F team but claims it canapost afford to offer decent pay and conditions. Its treatment of staff is disgraceful but they operate this way because this Government has given the green light to the worst aspects of capitalism. Tory MPs who yesterday protested against the casual sacking of workers belong to a party that has spent years making it easier for firms to do so.The Government that yesterday complained about the use of fire and rehire is the same one that blocked legislation which would have prevented it. POaposs move is not a one-off example of cut-throat corporate behaviour, it is a harbinger of what is to come as the Conservatives further erode long-standing workersapos rights. They will claim they are cutting red tape to make post-Brexit Britain more efficient but the reality will be more workers escorted from workplaces to make way for cheaper staff.

Image: James Maloney Lancs LiveByPaul HutcheonPolitical Editor, Daily Record:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsRishi Sunak has been criticised for making an “insulting” two minute, sixteen second speech to the Scottish Tory party conference.The Chancellor ’s blink and you might miss it address appeared to contain no new content, despite Scots facing falling living standards.Mr Sunak, tipped as a future Prime Minister, made a brief speech by video-link to the conference in Aberdeen. On the pandemic, he said: “Two years ago, we faced the greatest challenge of many of our letimes. “And in response we pulled together our resources as one United Kingdom to get through it, the Daily Record reports.  Mr Sunak added: “Together we protected over one million Scottish jobs, provided loans and grants to almost , Scottish businesses and delivered £. billion in additional funding for Scotland’s public services.” SNP MSP Rona Mackay said: In the middle of a crushing cost of living crisis the man who holds the purse strings thinks itaposs appropriate to devote just two minutes of his time to his own Scottish party conference.In a speech stuffed with shameless self-praise, Sunak provided not a single word of comfort or hope to thousands of hard-pressed Scottish families facing increasing financial uncertainty. This speech was nothing short of insulting and perfectly demonstrates Westminster Tory disdain for the people of Scotland. He also addressed the future: “We must chart a new course together one that delivers greater opportunity in every region and every community. “That is why this UK Government is committed to levelling up, and we are already taking action.“At the Budget, I announced £ million for  Scottish projects from Whithorn to Inverness as part of our Levelling Up and Community Ownership funds.“£ million for the British Business Bank to help small and medium sized Scottish businesses to grow and access to the £. billion Global Britain Investment Fund to secure international investment into Scotland.

The minister said the firm’s actions were “disgraceful” and “absolutely horrendous”, but told Sky News: “Sadly it is the case that the government cannot force an employer to continue to employ people that the employer has said it doesn’t want to employ.” The Mirror understands the government is still looking into whether PO Ferries’ actions were lawful. Ministers have asked officials to liaise with the Insolvency Service to checkthe firm notied it in advance - a legal requirement.But Mr Heappey’s comments came amid mounting outrage and pressure on Boris Johnson to step in. Labour has written to the Prime Minister demanding he “stands up for loyal workers in Britain”. Since this story was published, the government has said it is looking into whether the firm broke the law. Read the updated story here. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh, who is visiting sacked staff at Dover, called on the PM to suspend contracts and licences of PO Ferries’ owner DP World until the matter is resolved. She also demanded the company’s removal from the UK Government’s Transport Advisory Group. Demonstrations against the mass redundancies are taking place at Dover, Liverpool and Hull today. Firms are required by law to noty the Insolvency Service - and consult with staff -they plan to make more than  staff redundant at a single site. If there are  to  redundancies at a site, they must noty the Insolvency Service and start a consultation at least  days before the first dismissal. If there are  or more redundancies at a site, they must noty the Insolvency Service and start a consultation at least  days in advance. RMT union general secretary Mick Lynch claimed PO Ferries had “flagrantly broken the law, deliberately”. He told LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr: “The way you break the law is by not informing the [Business] department or the transport minister - they have to fill out an HR form to make redundancies. “They have to give  or  days’ notice of that consultation and you work through the trade unions and the reps what you’re going to do about this situation.” A union source told the Mirror union officials are % sure the action was unlawful, in their opinion, and are looking into the situation. Asked againit was legal, Armed Forces minister Mr Heappey told the BBC : “I’m not absolutely clear on that exact issue you raised, forgive me, my expertise is within the Ministry of Defence.“But I wasn’t aware there was any suggestion that it was illegal. I think it’s grubby.” He added: Ultimately, it is not something the Government can stop PO from doing. Now the focus will be on supporting those who have lost their jobs. Meanwhile Boris Johnson faces demands to spell out exactly when he knew about the sackings. Transport Minister Robert Courts said the government found out about the impending sackings on Wednesday evening. Mr Lynch fumed: “He knew this last night and didn’t tell anyone. “The Department For Transport knew this was happening and they knew they were going to break the law.”  PO Ferries owner DP World is majority-owned by the Dubai Sovereign Wealth Fund and, therefore, ultimately by the Dubai Royal Family. Last night a minister failed to sayBoris Johnson discussed the issue on a trip to the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday morning. No today said only a tight circle of officials in the Department for Transport knew on Wednesday night, and could not say when the PM found out. The PMaposs spokesman denied PO was raised in his meeting with the Crown Prince of the UAE on Wednesday, though could not immediately confirm the issue did not come up at all, in any way during the trip.Labour today demanded the Prime Minister answer whether “anyone” raised the issue on his trip to the UAE, of which Dubai is a part. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “This was a despicable assault on workers’ rights. “But British seafarers do not need meaningless platitudes - they need action. After the PM failed to get an agreement to ramp up oil production, she added: “Boris Johnson went to the UAE with a begging bowl, and as he ed eight hundred British workers were sacked without notice by one of their investment arms. “The Government must now stand up for loyal workers in Britain being undermined by overseas billionaires.” Tory ministers have faced a furious backlash as the scandal erupted just five months after they killed off a bid to outlaw ‘ fire and rehire’.Labour MP Barry Gardiner tried to ban the practice of firms sacking staff, then hiring them back on worse terms and conditions. His Employment and Trade Union RightsBill would have made it it easier to fight the tactic at a tribunal. It would have also restricted firmsapos ability to y terms through a contract, and force them to consult on changes for  or more employees. But Tory ministers blocked attempts to force a vote on the Bill, talking beyond a .pm cut-off time under arcane Commons rules. Mr Gardiner said last night: “The disgraceful actions taken by PO against their  seafarers shows yet again how employers are abusing the laws around fire and rehire. “The culture of insecurity treats workers as nothing more than a digit on a balance sheet is becoming normalised by both greedy businesses who are emboldened by governments.” A Whitehall source hit back that PO Ferries’ actions did not appear to be a case of fire and rehire. They said instead the firm appeared to be firing staff to hire dferent people on less money. Labour MP Diana Johnson said staff were sacked “immediately” to be replaced by “agency staff mainly from overseas”, waiting in buses by the quayside.This is shameful and it goes against all norms of fair and reasonable behaviour,” she told the Commons. “Itaposs clear that foreign ratings will be employed on terms that are less favourable than our current UK seafarers are. And this is about a race to the bottom in terms and conditions reminiscent of the worst Thatcherite policies.” The Tory chair of the Commons Transport Select Committee, Huw Merriman, said the news was deeply concerning. Firing loyal staff and replacing them with cheaper labour sourced from where is not a model that the public will wear,” he said. “That model was not acceptable when our national flag carrier airline attempted to adopt it, and it is not acceptable now.” Announcing the decision on Thursday, the ferry operator, bought by Dubai-based logistics giant DP World in , insisted the decision to cut jobs was very dficult but necessary as it was not a viable business in its current state. It said in a statement: We have made a £ million loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent, DP World. This is not sustainable. Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries. A PO spokesperson said: “All affected crew who worked yesterday were notied face-to-face and in-person, on board their vessels. “For crew who were rostered off, PO Ferries made all efforts to noty them personally: Virtual meetings were held, they were also inidually telephoned, plus email and SMS notications were sent before dismissal letters and severance terms were shared via courier and email. “For any crew members we did not reach personally despite this cascade of steps, regretfully the news of their dismissal must have come as a shock and we apologise for this.

RSPCA Inspector Kirsten Ormerod, who is investigating the incident, said: “Freya was incredibly lucky to survive after being thrown from a truck travelling at mph.Witnesses who saw the shocking incident said she was thrown with such force that she landed on the opposite side of the road, and the vehicle didn’t even slow down.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.“Some wonderful people who saw the events unfold rushed her to a local vet and contacted us to report the incident. Vets took Freya into surgery to check for any internal injuries but, amazingly, she came out of the incident relatively unscathed.“She’s now being cared for by RSPCA staff at one of our centres and is doing really well but is finding kennel le stressful. Unsurprisingly, given everything she has been through, she is very nervous and kennels are just too overwhelming for her.“We moved Freya into her own private area of the kennels which is much quieter and calmer, and we’ve discovered that she loves nature documentaries so she has her own TV which is always playing David Attenborough programmes in the background. They seem to soothe her and help her relax! “I’ve popped in to see her a few times and when I have case work and paperwork to do I often go and sit with her, have a cuddle and watch Blue Planet, which is her favourite. She just enjoys being with you.” The RSPCA continues to investigate who is responsible for abandoning Freya in such a horric act of cruelty and is appealing for anyone with information to contact the appeal line on    and leave a message for Inspector Ormerod.If you’re interested in offering an RSPCA rescue dog a new home please visit www.rspca.org.uk findapet.

Now, drivers in England may face a £ for bad parking under a new law that may come into force soon. Under new plans drawn up, fixed penalty notices could be given out to those who park on the street, eventhere’s no double yellow lines.If the laws pass through parliament, and drivers park up on a pavement, blocking a narrow road or the pathway itself, they could risk the £ fine. This comes as a quarter of motorists said they were unsure of the rules around parking on pavements,Manchester Evening News reported .New laws around parking on pavements are one of many coming into power this year. And as well as facing fines, drivers caught breaking the new laws could be hit with points on their license too.  Some of these changes are still under consultation in England and Wales, but it is believed that local councils will have more power when it comes to fining reckless parkers. However, parking on pavements is already illegal in London and some other parts of the UK. Scotland’s rulings are expected to come into force in . Whilst some drivers may wrongly think parking on the pavement is fine, and barely an offence, the paths are there for the safety of pedestrians. If blocked, pedestrians might be forced to walk around in the road, which is jeopardises their safety.  Alex Kindred, car insurance expert at Confused, told the MEN: “What may seem a small inconvenience to some, might be a huge hindrance to others. “But it’s important to remember that pavements are there for the use and safety of pedestrians only, and therefore should be respected by all other road users. “However, without a clearer understanding of the law around pavement parking, it’ll be hard to implement fines to drivers who break the rules.

The issue can be particularly dangerous for children and those with disabilities. A number of changes were made in the Highway Code recently which aims to protect all road users from unnecessary danger.  One of the rules involved pavements and the potential danger cyclists and pedestrians face when travelling down them. Rule  of the Highway Code states: “When using an electric vehicle charge point, you should park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for pedestrians from trailing cables. “Display a warning signyou can. After using the charge point, you shouldcharging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to pedestrians and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users.” Key pavement parking rules to watch out for Amid all of the new driving rules and laws being introduced in , these are thew three key pavement parking rules for drivers across England to look out for.Avoid parking on the pavementUnless there is a sign that explicitly says you are allowed to park your vehicle on the pavement, this should generally be avoided. Highway Code Rule  states: You MUST NOT park partially or wholly on the pavement in London, and should not do so where unless signs permit it.Parking on the pavement can obstruct and seriously inconvenience pedestrians, people in wheelchairs or with visual impairments and people with prams or pushchairs. Follow the pavement parking signs If the road you are parking on has a blue and white sign showing a car on the pavement, you are permitted to park on the pavement in that zone. This means that will not be fined for doing so.Avoid parking on the pavement outside your house Contrary to popular belief, unless you live on a private road the pavement outside your home belongs to the council. Therefore, youaposll still be slapped with fines for breaking parking rules.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Highways England\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Furious passengers were initially told routes would be cancelled for a few days but then by up to  days as they locate new crews, it was reported. Were you caught up in the chaos  Email webnews@mirror  A van driver said the situation was an absolute nightmare with no information.Workers have told how they were given five minutes to get their stuff and get off the ship, reported The Sun, with security guards wearing balaclavas came on board to remove people.A dad said PO was “stabbing us in the back” and that he had to switch off the call where he was told he was being sacked. They claim the firm is running at a £ million loss but DP World who run it from Dubai is thriving, he said. “What they want is British seafarers gone as they see us as too expensive. The new foreign workers are already on board.And I’ve got nothing against them. But clearly the company has been planning this behind our backs for a long time. It’s not fair.  “We should have been given notice. Not half an hour.” Another -year-old engineer who has worked on ferries for over  years said: “This is no way to treat people. “I’ve seen coachloads of agency crews waiting in the car park at Hythe services in Kent, just waiting to come down.” Images from motorway cameras on the M and the M suggest the queues have cleared up this morning. Crew members of the Pride of Hull staged a protest after hearing news of their redundancies, refusing to get off the ship as instructed.RMT member and regional organiser for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Gaz Jackson, shared several video updates during the sit-in. At around am said of the stand-off: Weaposve got a real situation going on on the ground. Weaposve got a coachload of Filipino ratings waiting to take over from our British crew and also a coachload of heavy hands that are supposed to be handcuff-trained. So Iaposm expecting us to be lynched off this vessel, but me and other members are going to stay on here as long as it takes to get this situation resolved. The shipaposs Captain, Dutchman Eugene Favier, said he would refuse to let police on boardthey attempted.When he left the ship to talk to management, agency staff boarded and the sit in was brought to a close at around .pm.  Unions and politicians condemned the move, blamed by the company on losses of £ million following the slump in travel because of the pandemic. The Rail, Maritime and Transport unionis seeking legal advice to challenge the sackings. It said the UK has seen one of the most “vicious examples of despotic employer behaviour” and one of the most shameful episodes in its recent industrial history. Announcing the decision on Thursday, the ferry operator, bought by Dubai-based logistics giant DP World in , insisted the decision to cut jobs was “very dficult but necessary” as it was “not a viable business” in its current state. The union called for mass trade union and wider public support for demonstrations in Dover, Liverpool and Hull on Friday.  In a message to RMT members, general secretary Mick Lynch said: “It was with deep shock that I learned the news of the wholesale job cuts taking place at PO Ferries, but I am sure that my shock was nothing as compared to the devastation this news brought to you and your colleagues. “PO’s decision to lay off  workers is a kick in the teeth to the hard-working members of staff who have kept the business running through the global health crisis. “The RMT has received reports that security guards at Dover have boarded ships with handcuffs to remove crew so they can be replaced with cheaper labour. This union is horried that PO Ferries can treat their loyal workforce in such a despicable manner. “PO Ferries claimed almost £ million in Government grants in , which included furlough payments for its employees. PO is owned by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai. It paid a £ million idend to shareholders in . “This appalling situation has arisen as a result of DP World wishing to maximise their profits and the failure of the Government to intervene and protect the jobs of you and your colleagues. “Your union is seeking advice on what legal action can be taken.”  Mark Dickinson of Nautilus International said there are serious safety concerns around the decision to replace the seafarers with agency workers.He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: There are serious safety concerns, which is why the company cannot reintroduce services with the lower-paid agency crew that theyaposve recruited via this company called International Ferry Management of Malta.Mr Dickinson said the Maritime Coastguard Agency must be absolutely clear and confident that those new crew, unfamiliar with the vessels, unfamiliar with the routes, with the berths can operate ships safely.He added: This is an intensely worrying situation.Weaposve written to the Maritime Coastguard Agency and we hope and we pray that they will do their job.I know they will. They will do their job and make sure the ships are safe. He added: It is a dark day in the shipping industry. Iaposve been in this game for over  years and Iaposve seen some curveballs and some shocking developments over that time, but this is a new low for a shipping company.To treat the due legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me, taken my breath away. Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, said PO had made “an appalling error”. “If they do not reverse immediately and reinstate the employees and follow proper process, it’s hard to see a way back for them commercially,” he said. “The parent DP World needs to understand that the British public will not do business with companies who treat their employees with such contempt.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said: “This is not a corporate restructure. It’s not the way we go about business in this country. “It is beneath contempt the action of thugs.” PO Ferries said in a statement: “We have made a £ million loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent, DP World. This is not sustainable. “Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now.

It marks the first time Prince William and Kate have been able to attend the event in two years, with the celebrating called off in  due to the pandemic and the parade cancelled in  due to most of the regiment being deployed overseas.This year, the couple picked back up their annual tradition of presenting the gt of sprigs of shamrock to officers and guardsmen who then distribute them across the rank.This is a -year tradition, usually carried out by a female member of the royal family, which began in  with Queen Alexander, and for many years the Queen Mother performed the duty, followed by Princess Anne. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. But, despite this being an incredibly long-running tradition for many years, the the Duchess of Cambridge broke royal tradition in  when she opted to stay home instead of attending the parade. Kate had performed the duty four years a in a row previously, before opting to stay at home with her children, Prince George and Prince Charlotte, leaving William to hand out the sprigs to  members of the st Battalion Irish Guards at Hounslow Cavalry Barracks in west London. Although people were notably disappointed about Kateaposs absence, Company Sergeant Major Carl Laverty said they were conscious that she has family commitments, adding that the lads were ecstatic to have their Colonel present the honours instead. At the time, aides were quick to highlight that it was primarily Williamaposs role as Colonel of the regiment to take part in the ceremony. Male members of the Royal Family have performed the duties on rare occasions. George VI, Earl Alexander of Tunis, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, the Earl of Cavan and Prince Edward have all taken part in the ceremony. This year, Kate took on the responsibility of presenting the regimentaposs mascot, an Irish wolfhound called Domhnall, with his very own shamrock.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Her landlord, Bromford housing association, says it has done all it can to sort the situation out but has been unable to make contact with the -year-old, reports Gloucestershire Live.Miss Van Damme, who uses a wheelchair, has lived at her property in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, for five years. The two-bedroom home has been adapted to her needs which include handrails on the stairs, bedroom and bathroom, along with seating adaptations in the bathroom. She said: “A gas engineer was sent out to cap my gas last month, and I have had to come and stay with my friend. I ache from head to foot. Since staying with my friend, I have only just begun being able to speak again as the cold made me so unwell. “I fell down the stairs in November last year after a vertigo attack. I thought I had damaged my tendons and was sent for an MRI scan. The scan showed I have arthritis and fibromyalgia in my back, neck and shoulders. Recently I was also diagnosed with having arthritis in my jaw and when I do not have heating or hot water it makes my health worse.” Miss Van Damme says her health continued to deteriorate because she had no hot water or heating. Sitting on her bath seat with hot water covering her aching bones is able to give her temporary relief from her pain.  Upset by what was happening, Miss Van Damme’s friend requested both she and her daughter go to stay with her. At this point, the tenant claims her skin was looking bruised and purple from the cold. Miss Van Damme said: “Living in a home with no heating or hot water really affects me. My friend saw how poorly I was and said to me ‘you cannot stay here’. My skin looked bruised and I was going purple with the cold. Due to Miss Van Damme’s ongoing hospital appointments, she missed several visits by the gas engineer to service her boiler. Yet Miss Van Damme says she called Bromford twice to try to reschedule the appointments when the gas supply was capped. She said: “Dates have been made to service the boiler when I was either in hospital or had to go to an appointment in December. “They asked me to call them in the new year, but I knew I had an appointment in January for the MRI so I was waiting for that to come. I called them twice about getting it sorted and never had a call back. “In February I heard a ring at my door and I was in bed poorly. Even with my disabilities, it would have taken time for me to answer the door, but a note was pushed through the door to say they had capped my gas.” Miss Van Damme called Bromford to explain her dficulties and how not having heating and hot water would affect her. She says on two occasions she was promised an engineer to visit that day.  Miss Van Damme said: “When I called back again to see what was happening, I was told the call out for an engineer had not been put on the system. I waited and stayed in as I was expecting someone to come round twice. “By this time my body was purple where I was so cold. They expect you to wait in for hours, in either a morning or afternoon appointment, but my body cannot take it. They have made me ill physically and mentally. They still get their rent and fob tenants off. “My daughter has been late for school because I have not been able to stay in Tewkesbury and been at my friendaposs place in Tuffley. I need my home with the adaptations. Bromford says it was forced to cap the gas after unsuccessful attempts to enter the property. The housing association also says it tried to get in touch with Miss Van Damme by text, phone call and letter.Bromford’s associate director of localities Dave Grinter said:: “One of our central aims is to ensure that all of our customers have a home that is safe, secure, and warm and we have a legal responsibility to carry out regular safety checks including annual gas fire and boiler servicing.“Unfortunately, and for Miss Van Damme’s own safety, we were forced to cap the gas at her property on February  after a number of unsuccessful attempts by letter, text message, and telephone to arrange a suitable time to carry out this essential servicing. “We have continued to try to make contact to resolve the situation and on Fridayour contractor attended but was denied access to the property. We remain committed to finding a solution in the quickest possible manner and would urge the customer to contact Bromford as soon as possible.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsArthritisHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her release came after the UK finally agreed to settle a £ million debt dating back to the s.Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said the Government was working to secure theof Mr Tahbaz, telling BBC Breakfast: He also has American nationality, which has in the eyes of the Iranians - not in ours - made his case more complicated.He added: We will continue to work to secure his release and, obviously, we work in close co-ordination with the US on these issues as well.

Lara Symons, , chief executive of charity Hostage International, said the organisation had helped many trauma hostages.She told the PA news agency: From that experience, weaposve learnt that this is a new journey. This is a long journey. I think when people think about normal le, they think about the le that they led before and, sadly, to some extent, that is not possible.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

Nina Doran worked as a lecturer in Teacher Education and English at the City of Liverpool College until she was suspended on September . The college said there had been a breach of confidence, and she learned should would be sacked. Ms Doran had been working at the college since September .As well as teaching, she was a representative for the Universities and Colleges Union branch at the city college, and would liaise with the UCU’s national office to organise unionised workers during industrial disputeShe told the Liverpool Echo : Because I was out of the workplace, I thought that maybe, maybe the suspension won’t go the whole way to a dismissal.It was all a bit of rollercoaster in the end. It’s just shocking, not being in the workplace and not doing what I do, it takes a lot of getting used to.” Both the college and Ms Doran said she could not go into further detail about the allegations while the appeals process was ongoing.  After Ms Doranaposs dismissal, a week of lunchtime protests at several college campuses followed, with unionised staff stressing she is the fourth union representative to be dismissed from the college in the last eight years. This alleged pattern of sackings led some of her colleagues to claim that her dismissal is part of a broader ide-and-rule policy they say is exercised at the college. In the days following Ms Doran’s dismissal, the City of Liverpool College branch of the UCU tweeted: “We are all shocked to discover that @DoranNina, our branch Liaison Chair, has become just the latest in a string of dismissals of prominent @ucu reps by COLC.  Nina has been dismissed for engaging in legitimate trade union activity, another clear case of trade victimisation.“We also believe that it was strategically timed in order to disrupt a legitimate and legal industrial dispute. COLC has maintained a clear ide-and-rule over UCU for years, the current regime manufacturing a culture of fear and intimidation.”Vicky Blake, President of the Universities and Colleges Union, said: “UCU stands in full support of Nina Doran, a hardworking rep who is now facing dismissal proceedings from her post at City of Liverpool College. Nina is a hardworking rep, who has in good faith worked tirelessly and honestly to promote and defend the interests of UCU members working at the college. “As a union we would like to work constructively and productively with the management team at COLC, for the benefit of all staff and students. Sadly, it appears there is a lack of reciprocity from COLC management in this. “Our reps work hard for members and have faced nothing but antagonising behaviour from this employer, the latest instance of which is represented in the dismissal proceedings against Nina Doran.” A spokesperson for the City of Liverpool College said: “While we are unable to comment on inidual cases, we are always focused on maintaining open dialogue with our trade unions to ensure the views and concerns of our valued team members are listened to and actioned where appropriate. We pride ourselves on our integrity and fairness as an employer, and as such take all of our decisions around staffing very seriously. As this is an ongoing matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed their youngest child, Prince Louis, on April , , Charlotte became the first woman in history to keep her place in the line of succession despite having a younger male sibling. But thataposs not all for the young royal, who will one day be sister to the King of England, as she could also inherit an incredibly rare title which has only been used seven times in history, My London reports.

Princess Charlotte could be given the name, the Princess Royal of the United Kingdom - a title which currently belongs to Princess Anne. This name was given to Anne by her mother, the Queen, back in , and will belong to her for the rest of her le, regardless of her familial relations within the monarchy. The title was established by Charles I in  for his daughter, Princess Matilda. The incredibly rare title is exclusively given to the eldest daughter of the monarch, so it is assumed Princess Charlotte will one day be given the title, when her father, Prince William, becomes King himself. Interestingly, the Queen herself missed out on the title of Princess Royal, as the eldest daughter of King George VI, but he was unable to give it to her as it still belonged to Princess Mary, until she died in . Given that she went on to become the Queen - one of only eight in our nationaposs history - she probably didnapost lose sleep over missing out on the title.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The Saharan dust cloud settled over the UK giving skies an otherworldly orange glowThe breathtaking setting could be Morrocco but it was in fact Cleveleys, near Blackpool, Lancs.ByRyan FaheyNews ReporterTom HaynesLucas CumiskeySamantha Mordi:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments British skies were a rainbow of colour as dust from the Sahara surged across Europe this week.The stunning dust creates spectacular orange-purple ripples in the sky with one photographer lucky to capture it as the sunset.Karl Houghton took pictures and said the rare phenomenon was really nice to see in the upper clouds.He added: The Saharan dust in the upper clouds added some really nice colour, with the breathtaking shots taken in Blackpool. In one picture, a massive conical-shaped sculpture, Maryaposs Shell, looks majestic on the sandy stretch beneath the alien sky. The crazy colours are caused by a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering, caused by additional particles in the air. Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said: The dust in the atmosphere causes the light to be more refracted, so you get the dominance of the red and orange tinges of the spectrum. The cloud formed when dust from the Sahara Desert was driven up into the air by a weather front dubbed Storm Celia by Spanish authorities. It was then pushed over the Mediterranean before covering parts of France and Spain.Baffled Brits were disgusted when they saw their cars in the early hours of the morning and thought the rain was really dirty.Lola Panic, a student from Deptford, southeast London, told The Mirror her garden chairs had been covered in dust as a result of the bizarre weather. Originally we felt a bit disgusted because of how dirty the rain seemed, said the -year-old. Then we felt slightly scared and confused, didn’t want to leave the house. In fact, none of us has left the house yet. But experts warned that the dust will cause a signicant reduction in air quality. Dr Ryder, who works at the University of Reading, said: The plume is forecast to reach southern England during the early hours of Wednesday, covering areas from Dorset to Suffolk, with the southeast counties, particularly Kent, being the worst affected. “Those up early enough on Wednesday will see the tell-tale red dusty sunrise. This is caused by the dust absorbing blue light from the sun and letting more red light through when the sun is low in the sky. By evening the dust will have moved eastwards towards the Netherlands and Germany., he added. One motorist was shocked when she saw the dusty rainwater first thing in the morning. Donna Deeming, , from Basildon, Essex, was only popping out to grab some milk when she noticed her car was covered in dusty rainwater. I sat in the car and thought aposwhat on earth has happened apos the finance administrator said. It’s only very drizzly here. There have been no downpours as yet, so I wasn’t suresomeone had thrown something on the car orit was from some building work locally. Dr Andy Whittamore - the clinical lead at Asthma UK - warned of the risks posed by Saharan dust. He said: Toxic air can leave people struggling for breath and can cause wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and even a le-threatening asthma attack, he said. “Saharan dust could pose a serious risk to the . million people in the UK with asthma.

Jenner Proctor, broke her spine at the end of her nightmare holiday in , suffering catastrophic injuries during her descent of the extreme -foot high slide at the Aqualand waterpark, in Mallorca. She had to undergo an emergency spinal fusion in Spain to treat her injuries, and says the damage left her ft ins tall, four inches shorter than her apos  height before the accident. Before the tragedy Ms Proctor , of Leighton Buzzard, Beds, was training to be a teacher, but the accident left her struggling to pay for her course and tore her le apart. She is currently not working. Now she has launched a £, damages claim against Spanish amusement park operators, Aspro Ocio S.A, as well as a firm of Spanish insurers, Liberty Seguros, alleging fault in management of the slide.  One would not expect to use this water slide and come off it with a broken back, said Ms Proctoraposs QC, Katherine Deal, during a hearing at the High Court in London. The issues of liability and compensation for her injuries are both disputed. The -foot Banzai ride is designed to power users down the slide boosted by water jets at the top, with riders then flying across the water when they reach the bottom. Ms Proctor, however, says she wasnapost given proper instruction before beginning her descent down the chute on a bodyboard. And after the accident, Ms Proctor - who was a keen swimmer - said she believed she was thrown off her board before even hitting the water. On top of the gruelling surgery to fuse her spine, she then suffered a recurring septic infection for several months after treatment. Her case reached Londonaposs High Court as lawyers discussed pre-trial issues involving analysis of Spanish law and expert evidence about the use of the water slide. The trial itself is expected to be dealt with in line with Spanish law. Although Ms Proctor has now recovered from her fractured spine, her injury has left a legacy of lasting chronic pain, said her barrister after the short hearing.

Under clear skies it will be frosty for much of the country and could dip to -C in Scotland.Fog patches may cause some disruption to travel during the morning rush hour, said theMet Officewith a yellow warning running until .am through western England and Wales.A widespread frost with temperatures dipping down close to freezingnot below, certainly for the glens of Scotland we could see a value of - or -C to start the day, said Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir. We run into this dense fog anywhere from the Midlands, mid-Wales down towards the West Country, central and southern England.  But the temperature will soon rise with warmest temperatures in central and southern England and Wales. Ms Nasir continued: Through the day on Friday plenty of blue sky and plenty of sunshine. The sunshine could turn hazy in the west of Scotland as we see more high cloud there and certainly quite a breeze across the Western Isles. Even so everywhere remains dry through the afternoon and that will really help temperatures up very nicely as we head through the middle part of the day. So temperatures coming in around C or C in Scotland or Northern Ireland. However we could see values peaking around C or C across mid-Wales, down towards the south east of England. That’s the picture on Friday, a bright end to the working week.”  Then on Saturday the warmest temperatures are expected to be in Scotland. Winds coming in from the east or the South East means that the highest temperatures are always going to be across more sheltered western areas,” said Mr Bett, of BBC weather. “It could make C along the coast of north west England but it is up towards the north west Highlands and perhaps in the Moray Firth that temperatures could reach C or C, it could be the warmest day of the year so far.” UK forecast for the next  days Plenty of fine weather today once early fog clears. Today: Early fog patches over parts of Wales, the Midlands and southern England soon lting and clearing. Otherwise, conditions fine and dry with plenty of pleasantly warm sunshine. Breezy in the north and across English Channel coastal areas. Tonight: Quickly turning chilly this evening and then a dry night with mostly clear skies. Breezy as well, especially in the south and west. Saturday: Fine, dry and bright with plenty of sunshine, but also windy, especially in the south and west. Feeling pleasantly warm in the sunshine out of the wind. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Mostly fine and dry with some sunshine. Cloudier in the east with rain and showers moving north, becoming dry on Tuesday. Cooler than recently, but turning warmer again by Tuesday.

It comes as the company brutally made  of its crew redundant via video-call and replaced them with cheaper agency workers.The knock-on effect left customers stranded abroad and scrambling to get home after the company suspended some services for  days. One TikTok user shared a video from Rotterdam, where her friend Heidi had been left without her  teeth, after travelling from Hull, only for their ing service not to turn up. In a video, she said: PO havenapost turned up and Heidi has left her teeth on the boat.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here She added in a caption: This trip couldnapost get any worse, sheaposs left her teeth on the boat. People were left in stitches, with one viewer writing: Well at least you canapost say that PO are toothless. Another outraged viewer wrote: They should have left you to get your stuff since they have been made redundant. A third added: Good on you for turning a bad thing into a funny thing, I hope [she] gets her gnashers back. Happily, Heidi was reunited with her teeth a day later - with a TikTok video capturing her jubilation at being reunited with her gnashers. She can be heard exclaiming Oh my god, my teeth. Flippinaposeck, the panic about that was unbelievable. It comes as a captain of a giant PO ferry travelling between Rotterdam and Hull was hailed a hero after drawing up his gangplanks and refusing to allow police or new crewmen to board his vessel. The captain of the Pride of Hull, understood to be Eugene Favier, sealed himself and his crew inside the ferry in the Port of Hull just hours after P announced mass redundancies. The ship normally carries a crew of  people aboard and is one of the biggest ferries in Europe - makes regular crossings between Hull and the Dutch port of Rotterdam.

Ricky Siemens was driving illegally in a truck that was on a spare tyre when the wheel burst. His truck had a head on smash into a van carrying young golfers from a Texas university, on Tuesday night. The National Transportation Safety Board vice-chair Bruce Landsberg confirmed the horric incident which led to a number of deaths, over half of whom were teenagers. They smashed into a van carrying eight University of the Southwest golf students, six of whom and their coach died.The fiery smash happened west of Dallas, Texas, just north of the towns of Midland and Odessa. Ricky had been driving with his -year-old dad Henrich Siemens, a dad-of-five, with the pair were on their way to pick up a new car at the time.  Agatha ‘Aggie’ Siemens, the widowed mum who lost her husband and son in the crash said: “They were going to pick up a car that [Siemens] bought. “I was supposed to see him about two hours later,” The New York Post reported. The crash killed college golfers Mauricio Sanchez, , Travis Garcia, , Jackson Zinn, , Karisa Raines, , Laci Stone, , and Tiago Sousa, . Two students, Hayden Underhill and Dayton Price, survived the horric smash. They were pulled from the wreckage and airlted to a nearby hospital where as of yesterday they remained in critical condition. Mr Price suffered third-degree burns to nearly half his body according to the description of a GoFundMe campaign that has since raised £,. Their coach Tyler James, , who was driving the young athletes was also tragically killed in the accident.After their tyre burst, the van swerved across the central reservation and slammed into the oncoming van head on. “This was clearly a high-speed collision,” Landsberg said, but he added it was unclear how fast the vehicles were travelling. Sergeant Steven Blanco of Texas DPS told the New York Post that the cause of the crash had not yet been determined and cops ordered toxicology and other forensic reports. According to state law in the area, motorists must be at least  years old to get their provisional licence, and at least  before they can begin to get classes to get their learner’s licence.  The college’s Ford Transit van was carrying nine people and towing a box trailer while heading back from a recent golf tournament, where both the women’s and men’s teams had competed.The accident remains under investigation and grieving relatives mourned their losses on Facebook.Ms Siemens posted a collage tribute to her two boys which read: “in loving memory” surrounded by pictures of the family. Ms Siemens posted another tribute to the boy on Facebook with a photo of her son in his NASA T-shirt and tracksuit pants, smiling at the camera. The NTSB revealed the age of the driver on Thursday but didn’t identy him.  Tributes have been pouring in for the six college golfers and coach who were killed in the crash. Gary Raines, father of Karisa, , who died in the accident, speaking on the Today show, said: “We are praying so much for the families of all those other kids. “Right now we just keep thinking we’re gonna wake up from this terrible nightmare. But itaposs not happening.” Karisa’s mum, Sandy, said: “I donapost know what Iaposm going to do without her.” A fundraiser for funeral expenses for Karisa has raised £, so far.  A memorial has been set up at the golf course where the team practiced, with flowers, gold balls and handmade signs left for the youngsters. Rockwind Community Links manager, Ben Kirkes saw the golfers almost everyday. He said: “aposWe have a memorial. Itaposs the very least we could do for the players and of course coach James. Itaposs a tough time. “These kids were great kids and they were great, great community members. They were polite and they were just a pleasure to be around.” Ryan Erwin, vice president for student engagement and athletics at East Texas Baptist University in Marshall, said that Coach James had been “living out his dream”.

As when somebodyaposs kindness is taken for granted, they can grow tired of helping - even when itaposs a blood relative. One woman ended up kicking her pregnant sister out her house after she tried to change her lestyle.Venting to Reddit, the woman explained how her sister abandoned her beloved dog on the other side of the city because she didnapost want a wild animal around her newborn.She said: Last year my -year-old sister was kicked out of her boyfriendaposs house and I took her in.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  We donapost have the best relationship but she was jobless and I was the only relative still living in our country. Surprise, surprise... about two months later she figured out she was pregnant. Her sister began to complain about her two-year-old husky, who is said to be a total sweetheart. She was saying how it would be bad for her baby and that she wouldnapost raise her kid with a aposwild animalapos around, she added. I told her it was my house andshe wasnapost comfortable here, she could leave and my dog was staying no matter what. She kept complaining but I wouldnapost change my mind. It was when the woman was working away when her sister drove to the other side of the city with the husky, tied him up to a railing and drove back home without him. When I came back my dog was not home and my sister claimed she had no idea where he was. We got into a fight because I didnapost believe her, she said.  I ended up storming off and asked a few neighboursthey had seen him. One told me that last time he saw him was when my sister took him somewhere a few days ago. She uses my Uber account because sheaposs broke so when I found an odd trip to the other side of the city, I connected the dots. After driving miles in search for her beloved dog, the woman spent hours asking strangers in the street whether theyaposd seen a husky wandering around. The -year-old added: I found my dog in a street restaurant, the owner took him after a aposblonde pregnant womanapos left him leashed to a fence. I ended up explaining the situation, paying him like £ and I got my dog back. When I went back home I kicked out my sister, I gave her enough money for a week in a hotel and sent her on her merry way, she made a huge scandal and I admit I was a bit too forceful but I was furious. She called all my family and friends and theyaposre all telling me Iaposm an a****** for picking my dog over my sister and that I should take her back, that I should value that unborn baby more than a silly animal. I think my dog is more important and what my sister did is unforgivable. While some users said the woman should have picked her pregnant sister over her dog, most users agreed she was in the right to kick her out. One user said: I think you should have driven her across the city and tied her to a fence instead of paying for her hotel room. You had to buy your dog back, paying for her hotel on top of it is over the top. What she did is beyond disturbing. Another added: The fact that she even felt like this was OK blows my mind. Her sister is a guest in her home, one that doesn’t get to dictate who lives there. You should tell your family and friends to take in your sister then. Youaposve done her part in sheltering her this far. A third added: People like to take out their problems on the most innocent and helpless beings and they adore the aposbut it’s just a silly animalapos or aposstill just a dog, cat, hedgehog, and so onapos and they have the nerve to expect empathy from others.

Edward believes itaposs none of these options, claiming that it doesnapost look from this earth. He said: When Iaposm bored, Iaposll go on Google Earth, and look around at dferent locations that youaposre never going to see [in real le].

I couldnapost say what it is. The way itaposs flying, itaposs sort of vertical, not horizontal like a plane. But Edwardaposs post was greeted with a lot of skepticism. He explained: Thereaposs quite a few non-believers in the group. I put it up and people started saying all sorts. I donapost know why non-believers are in that grouptheyaposre just going to slate everything. I know what I saw and it wasnapost a seagull, I never saw a seagull that looked like that. Some people said it looked like a body ascending, like Jesus. One person even said it looked like Michael Jackson doing his hat-off pose. I donapost think itaposs a body ascending and I definitely donapost think itaposs Michael Jackson. Itaposs just something I canapost identy, so Iaposd classy it as a UFO. Personally I thinkaliens were to be anywhere on the planet, theyaposd be up around places like Greenland or Antarctica. I definitely think itaposs not from this earth. Andit is from Earth, the only other thing I think it could be is something the military are working on. They could be testing somewhere out there, like a drone or something we havenapost seen yet. Whenever I see UFOs I get excited, Iaposve seen a few of them over the years. I look up more than most people, so maybe thataposs why Iaposm always seeing them.Edwardaposs sightings were met with a mix of mockery and cynicism. One person wrote: That is very clearly the Lord and saviour himself. A second said: Looks like a body either ascending or descending. Another commented: My God. Itaposs clearly a seagull.

According to the conflicted mother-to-be, all three of them are well aware that their situation is uncommon, knowing that they will just have to learn along the way.Taking to Reddit, she explained how things got more complicated after the three of them headed out to dinner a few days back.

Maddy told me she wanted to give them her dadaposs name as a middle name since it was special to her.Iaposll be honest, I donapost like the idea because a family nameseems very personal. Also, I didnapost like that she behaved like the decision was set since thataposs not our deal. Jasper didnapost seem that fond of the idea either so I told her that, while we could consider it and think about it, I wasnapost sure. She continued: Maddy got quite p***y and said that it wasnapost fair that she wasnapost allowed to have or say anything without passing it through the aposmom policeapos because this was her child too. She canapost be in the delivery room, she wonapost give birth to them or have any legal rights and the least I could do is let her have the middle name. Jasper tried to argue with Maddy, but she refused to listen, taking her things and leaving the restaurant. The poster and Jasper stayed for a little while longer, during which time he apologised before driving her back to her own home. The posteraposs mother has now said that she understands Maddyaposs perspective, telling her daughter that she may as well let her have the middle name, as it really doesnapost matter as much as the first one anyway. Clarying the situation, the pregnant woman explained that she has slept with Jasper and Maddy three times since finding out she was expecting but stated that this doesnapost make them partners, with the couple having their own separate relationship.One fellow Reddit user wrote: I am sorry that the woman lost a child, but this is your child. Itaposs all % yours. She will be the stepmother. She will have a special place in your childaposs le, but the honour of naming your child is not in that role.The major decisions are yours and she needs to completely understand that, or there will definitely be more problems.

Iaposm sureyou didnapost plan on maintaining a relationship , neither did she, so I can understand her acting a little out of pocket.

She wrote: The day my fiancé and I set a date for our wedding, my mother pulled us to the side and askedwe would be willing to move the wedding up an entire year, so she could use our reception as her th birthday party. She thought it would be fun. We would get the ceremony, she’d have the reception, and everyone would be happy. I just don’t understand how someone could even ask that. I understand the whole aposno one cares as much about your wedding as you doapos thing, but this feels ridiculous. I feel like out of anyone other than my fiancé and I, my mom should be one of the people most excited, right  But she just cares about having a big birthday party, and she’s actually upset that we said no. To her taking over our wedding to throw herself a party. I will never understand her thinking, and I’m sure she’s going to bring it up again. Or do something  to make my wedding day about her. It’s what she does best, after all. Commenters on the Reddit post were equally baffled by the mumaposs actions, as many said she canapost commandeer the womanaposs wedding day for her own party. One person said: Thataposs a terrible thing for her to think and an even worse thing to actually ask of you and your fiancé! Why donapost you tell her to throw her bday party and youaposll have your wedding in the middle of it, see how she likes that idea.

And even host Ben Shephard was left in stitches when he was shown the clip on Good Morning Britain, adding I think we need to go there for a pint!  What do you think about the celebration  Let us know in the comments...In the clip, punters in the pub in Belfast, Ireland, are clearly feeling the tension as contestant John answers questions to earn counters, which are then placed into a giant coin pusher. People begin shouting “go on” at the pub’s TV, and a small cheer can be heard as a few coins fall over the sides - but thataposs nothing compared to whataposs to come.  Johnaposs luck continues as the jackpot counter - a gold coin with a red star- then falls over the side, and the whole pub erupts. In scenes resembling the Hyde Park celebration when England scored a goal in the World Cup, people can be seen jumping in the air, cheering, as drinks struggle to stay in their glasses. Dannyaposs video has been viewed over , times and had over a thousand comments, mostly from people blown away by the footage.

And a third wrote: This country is unreal. You will never see anything like this again, commented another TikTok user. So watch it, breath it in. Soon the popularity of the clip spread beyond social media and Good Morning Britainaposs Richard Arnold shared the clip with Tipping Point host Ben Shephard. Watching the clip, he said I got sent that yesterday from Dannyaposs TikTok account and Iaposm not on TikTok and someone said, aposBen have you watched this apos I think itaposs a pub called the Hatfield in Belfast and all the students get together, I think they watch Tipping Point and then they watch The Chase and they have a big event.

She also claimed she drank more that night than she would normally do and thought she and her date were just having fun, so was shocked to discover she had been lied to. She wrote: I donapost know why but Iaposm getting flashbacks to the guy who, a few years ago, tried on a good one with me . We had a great time, and he kept saying how much he was enjoying himself.

Iaposm at the place weaposre supposed to meet. And he texted methat he was running late. Weaposre in an area with no traffic. Dating should be fun. Not confusing. And commenters on the Reddit post were quick to share their own stories of dating disasters, as it was soon revealed that many of them had been through similar scenarios. One person said: I think a lot of men also test boundaries early on to see what you’ll tolerate. If you don’t say anything, they take it as a go-ahead to continue such behaviour. I’ve known countless women who try to play it cool in the beginning because they don’t want to seem high maintenance. Then they end up in a relationship with someone who engages in unacceptable behaviour. While another added: I literally just left a date because the guy was super late. He was straight-up  minutes late. He still didn’t show up  minutes after telling me he was looking for parking. He was either standing me up or he really didn’t respect me or my time. Perhaps he was also testing how long I would wait. Creating tests is toxic behaviour.

Each one of the prams is empty and represents a child killed since February , and a family mourning their tragic loss. The eerie picture is a timely reminder of the human cost of the Kremlinaposs actions. The prams were put behind rails to keep them undisturbed and to allow passers-by to see them.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere Mayor of Lviv Andriy Sadovyi said:  kids.  kids have been killed by Russians since the day one of full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.Empty prams on Rynok Square in Lviv today symbolize the lives of little angels. They are now defending Ukraine’sky instead of decisive actions of the world. His words echoed Ukraineaposs calls for the west to turn the countryaposs airspace into a no-fly zone. However, western leaders like Joe Biden have always said that they would never take such an action as it would likely lead to open war with Russia. As the invasion continues, an intelligence update from the British Ministry of Defence said that Russia had made minimal progress this week.The stuttering attack was reportedly initially planned by the Kremlin to be a aposlightning invasionapos, that would have seen them take the country in a matter of days and depose the standing government.  Instead, Russia finds itself struggling to take the major cities and urban centres, while negotiating with the government it sought to depose. The display of prams is just one sign this week of Russiaaposs barbarity. Experts have said that, after its failure to take the cities quickly, the Kremlin then turned to indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets. This week also saw a theatre in Mariupol that was sheltering around , civilians attacked. Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, confirmed the atrocity and said hundreds remain unaccounted for. He added they cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city have been decimated by Russian forces.In a Facebook post, he wrote: No one understands. Services that are supposed to help are demolished, rescue and utility services... are physically destroyed.A lot of doctors have been killed. This means that all the survivors of the bombing will either die under the ruins of the theater, or have already died.

The sprawling property in Alberta, Canada, which is on the market for ,, , was built back in . It is spread over two storeys and is surrounded by a brick wall with large security gates at the front. Visitors are welcomed into a huge front entrance, flanked by cascading Greek-style columns, and once inside, can park their car in either a seven-car garage or a James Bond-style underground area with room for an additional three motors.  The estate agent has described the property’s two watchtowers as a sunroom and an observatory respectively, however a portion of viewers seem to think otherwise. Prospective buyers have commented on the watchtowers, commenting that they look like a prison’s observation tower looking over the house’s “yard”. Bemused viewers took to the popular online forum Reddit website to share their thoughts.  Must be a place for rich ex-convicts who want to be reminded of their time in the big house,” one user joked. Another referenced the prison drama Shawshank Redemption, featuring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, which shows the characters tunnelling out of prison and escaping to Mexico. I like that they paved the whole yard so you can’t discretely sprinkle sand down your pant leg from your escape tunnel. “Smart,” they said. Spread over . acres, the property boasts an indoor pool with two slides and a pool area to relax in, as well as a built-in BBQ area and steam room, for added luxury. A personal cinema offers space to nestle in and enjoy a good film, while a games room fitted out with a pool table and bar also features in the impressive property.

However, he says Vladimir Putins army is not winning the war and is weakening its gripA Ukrainian policeman secures the area at a residential district that was damaged by shelling in Kyiv Image: REUTERSByJohn Sweeney in Kyiv:,  Mar |comments A Russian missile powered towards the heart of Kyiv before it was knocked out of the sky by a Ukrainian air defence rocket.The debris scissored to earth on the east bank of the Dnipro river, away from the centre of the city, blasting the top of a ten-storey apartment block, killing one person and injuring two, shattering windows in the whole neighbourhood, including a school, a local clinic and a kindergarten. Thankfully, most people were hiding in bunkers and survived. Maria, , and her little girl, Olga, four, were woken up by the explosion: “We felt it.” Maria pointed out a low building with very single window blown out: “That’s where Olga has her dancing classes.” But the most striking thing about the east bank was the absence of crumps and bangs. The Russian army has stopped moving forwards. Far from encircling the city, the eastern claw of Vladimir Putin ’s forces is weakening its grip. To the west, the Russians and the Ukrainians are locked in mortal combat, fighting for every street, every house. The dference is simple: the Ukrainians are fighting for their homes and their kids the Russians are fighting for one man in a high castle. The killing continues in Kyiv and across the whole of Ukraine but the big picture is that Vladimir Putin’s dogfood army is not winning the war. I call it the dogfood army because, a while back, a Russian army officer was sacked because he complained his boys were being fed “prime quality beef” which was, in fact, dogfood relabelled.The Ukrainians have found abandoned Russian tanks equipped with food rations with “eat-by” dates from . There are multiple videos of Russian soldiers scavenging for food in Ukraine. An army marches on its stomach. If it doesn’t eat, it doesn’t march.  It’s not just the food. “Any army who doesn’t look after its dead is in trouble,” said Johnny Mercer, the Tory MP for Plymouth and, in a previous le, a British army commando, who passed through Kyiv last week. The litter of Russian dead has become a commonplace the fact that the Russian soldiers don’t bother to pick up and bury their fallen comrades shows their morale is rock bottom.The second great weakness of the dogfood army is corruption. Michael Weiss, an American journalist who is writing a book on Russia ’s military intelligence service, the GRU, says: “there is mounting evidence that the Kremlin are fielding a Potemkin army. Their soldiers don’t want to fight. They’re abandoning tens of millions in kit. And there have been credible allegations of rampant corruption in the military with billions stolen by crooked officers.” The Russian army’s third great weakness is that its ultimate leader, Vladimir Putin, trusts no-one, like Stalin, not even himself. He was so paranoid about the army leaking his invasion plans that he told them two nights before D-Day. That meant that the generals have had to make it up as they were going along. The Ukrainians believe in their cause and are fighting like tigers. The dogfood army is hungry, scared, cheated by corrupt generals and led by a paranoiac who he sits at a table that screams theof his fear. Don’t be surprised, then, that the Russian army is not moving forwards.

There are also demands for Ukraine to undergo a disarmament process to make sure thereaposs no threat to Russia and protection for Russian as a language in Ukraine, reports said.Another demand was said to be about aposde-Nazicationapos which is deeply offensive to Zelensky, who is Jewish himself.  Other discussions involved the status of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, though no specic details were given about this. Putin reportedly said that some of the negotiations would need to be face to face with Zelensky, which the latter is said to be prepared for.  A peace deal could take a long time to reach and it will be a long time until Ukraine is able to rebuild the cities Russia has destroyed. Russia expanded its missile strikes to Lviv in the west of Ukraine as British intelligence suggested Vladimir Putinaposs invasion had made only minimal progress this week. Armed forces minister James Heappey said on Friday the early-morning attack on the city that has swelled with people sheltering from where in Ukraine showed Russia was broadening its strikes.  Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit a facility for repairing military planes near the cityaposs international airport and also damaged a bus repair site.

However, a new iant has emerged and cases are up by %British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Image: REUTERSopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments For weeks, the politicians were very quiet about Covid, pretending it’s gone away.Then ministers suddenly got busy, lting all travel restrictions from today.

Protection gained by booster jabs is fast disappearing, and we’re still waiting for the vital fourth dose. It may come soon for the over s and vulnerable, but not until later in the year for the general population. With a hundred deaths being recorded every day, this feels like Covid complacency.And the Government is dragging its feet over the independent pandemic inquiry. It’s unlikely to take evidence before the winter – and not report until at least two years.This deliberate delay takes the verdict on the Great Tory Pandemic Bungle until well after the general election, thereby letting Boris Johnson off the hook.

The succulent had blue-coloured veins which changed colour over the years, leading to her believing it was growing nicelyThe plant had blue-coloured veins which changed colour over the years, leading to her believing the succulent was growing and developing nicelyBySamantha Mordi:,  Mar |commentsA woman lovingly watered a houseplant every single day for nearly three years before discovering it is actually made of plastic. Ms Liu shared images of the succulent on social media and admitted she felt silly after noticing her mistake. The woman from China, said she bought the plant online and took care of plant like a baby. However when she shared images online, she said she realised that she could not move the leaves with her hand and it soon dawned on her that it was actually made of plastic.. The plant had blue-coloured veins which changed colour over the years, leading to her believing the succulent was growing and developing nicely. She continued to water the plant over the subsequent years and believed it was growing well and looked healthy.  Adding she took care of the plant like a baby and watered it every single day. Admitting the discovery left her feeling stupid, she said that she could see the funny side. This comes as last year Caelie Wilkes religiously watered her houseplant for more than two years. The woman, who had a strict watering schedule for the plant was devastated when she found out that her plant wasnapost real.She told friends on Facebook that she feels as though the last two years had been a lie.It was only when she went to re-pot the succulent that she noticed it was fake. She said: I just wanted to keep good care of it. I absolutely loved my succulent. She explained that after finding a cute vase which suited it perfectly, she decided she would re-pot it. But as she started to pull it out of its original plastic container she saw that it was attached to a block of foam, and decorated with sand which was glued on top. She said: Tried my hardest to keep it looking its best, and itaposs completely plastic. Her story was shared to an Australian indoor plant group Facebook page, where a number of others admitted theyaposd also made the same mistake. One said: My friend at work always kills the plants because she doesn’t water them, so I put a fake one in the cafe. She watered it for a month before I told her it was fake. And another added: Another said: aposMy dad watered one of my mumaposs plants for a year after she died not realising it was fake.

A team at Essex University who looked at the lestyle of  people also found that boredom was also linked to sitting in front of a television, bird-watching and smoking. Led by the Department of Psychologyaposs Dr Wijnand Van Tilburg the research revealed that stereotypically aposboringapos people are generally avoided because others pre-judge them and give them a wide berth. Dr Van Tilburg said: Ironically studying boredom is actually very interesting and has many real-le impacts. We found how persuasive perceptions of boredom are and what an impact this can have on people.  Perceptions can change but people may not take time to speak to those with aposboringapos jobs and hobbies and avoid them instead so they donapost get a chance to prove people wrong and break these negative stereotypes. The very fact that people choose to avoid them can lead to social ostracisation and increase loneliness leading to a really negative impact on their lives. The study also showed that people seen as boring seem to have low competence and little interpersonal warmth - but in reality may be at greater risk of harm, addiction and mental health issues. And despite the negative perception society needs people to work in accounting and banking.

Tallest model in the world, Ekaterina Lisina spoke to former porn star, Alexis Texas on her podcast, Private Talks. She said that her height causes conflict when she is trying to find a partner. The Russian athlete and basketball player said she was anxious, when she realised she may take after her equally tall parents.Her mother and father are ft ins, the Daily Star reports.I was afraid because I know how kids and people generally react to height, and it’s not good,” she remembered.And, as she grew older, Ekaterina’s height also began to play an unhelpful role in her romantic le. “You know those problems, when you like a boy but he’s much shorter, or you like a tall boy but he doesnapost want to be with you because you are too tall for him, she explained.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

He agreed to a further meeting with the directors of Dunbar Community Development and Heritage Trustin February. Cllr Hampshire has not responded to email requests.Cllr Hampshire states “the woodland area is in pretty poor condition and there has never been any management take place”. DCWG has never had any role or responsibility for that part of Lochend Wood. It is in the privately owned  hectares at Hallhill West and North. DCWG have successfully managed a separate  hectares of Lochend Wood since .As Cllr Hampshire describes, drainage ditches have collapsed at his proposed site. It is now waterlogged, not suitable for construction.An environmental impact assessment is essential. His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups. This location would create a perfect storm of risk.His vision – a ‘community cafe’, open  till  – would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install basic services to the site. How could this be sustainable  Even the Bleachingfield Centre cafe, with the library on site, close to the town centre and the primary school, was not viable. He suggests young people could watch television at the hub. Why not Bleachingfield or the Hallhill Centre  Why waste precious resources Great new facilities – The Space at DunBear Park – are planned.

introduced a weekly kerbside recycling service after adding a fourth recycling receptacle to the household collections.Under the new regime, a food waste bin, two separate boxes for glass and paper card, and a white bag for plastic and cartons, are collected one day a week.Household waste bins are collected fortnightly on a separate day and garden waste bins remain on a monthly collection.: East Lothian Councils new recycling scheme launchedMr Hampshire asked the developer: “Would there be a design within your proposal so people had somewhere to put these boxes at the front of their property for collection on collection day “Everybody now does it,you drive round that estate on collection day you’ll see these boxes andthey are on the footpath itself it can cause an obstruction.“If there was at least a space at the front garden where these could be laid then it would certainly be a big help to the local authority and what we are trying to achieve and to your customers when they buy your properties.”Mr Hampshire asked Mr Hampton to take the request back to his firm as something to consider for future developments.However, a spokesman for East Lothian Council said that the current policy would need to be changed and approved by councillors before collections could be made from people’s gardens.A spokesperson said: “Waste services guidance requires developers to create storage for waste and recycling containers within the boundary of each property.“Collections, however, are operated on the basis of presentation at the kerbside.“A change in policy would require wider discussion between council departments and ratication at committee level.”"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

What this shows is how far back in history the crimes of the patriarchy against women reach. In fact the control of women by men goes back to the beginning of time, and this is what Nicola Sturgeon’s apology means.The whole culture needs to be changed, and to this end, there is a programme in five schools in the Govan district of Glasgow to teach boys, as well as girls, that males controlling females is not acceptable. It is starting at a young age so that the children, boys as well as girls, realise what is acceptable and what is not acceptable behaviour.The patriarchal society we live in has to change. This does not mean that it is acceptable for women to treat men badly, either. We must have respectful attitudes from either sex to the other. It is not about criminalising men and boys, it is about ending the idea that one gender is superior to the other.Freedom of speech comes with responsibility. We are responsible for respecting each other. If that cannot be taught at home, then it is a good idea to teach it at school.Jess Phillips read out at Westminster the names of women who have been killed by men. Sara Everard was murdered by a serving police officer last year. When women held a vigil to protest against male violence, women were arrested. The patriarchy must realise that we need things to change.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.MEN ARE NOT BEING DEMONISEDSTUART Waitons accusation of a witch-hunt against men is obsessive and excessive. The paranoid tone of his article is set by the use of the word \"woke\", which Im assuming is meant as an insult and frequently used to put down those who object to the use of sexually explicit language deliberately directed towards women. Why would any right-minded inidual see such conversations as acceptable or appropriate This proposed legislation is not demonising men en masse. It is calling out those embarrassing iniduals who routinely denigrate women in the most offensive and threatening way. As a mother of two wonderful sons who have grown into decent young men, I know that they do not feel demonised by the prospect of this new legislation because they know that it is not targeted at them or their many male friends.Moira Smith, Johnstone.* READING Adam Tomkins article Crime Bill\", The Herald, March  it would be hard to know where he stands in the gender debate, when he queries \"could awoman be liable for harassing a trans woman\" Why is the word \"biological\" bracketed and the word \"trans\" not  Bracketing the word \"biological\" suggests that the word \"woman\" clearly needs defining.

Are CBD capsules better than CBD oil CBD capsules are usually formulated with the same or similar CBD oil formula that is sold as a tincture with a dropper. CBD capsules were created to provide consumers with a more accurate way to dose CBD.Both are highly effective at treating the same conditions, ailments, and symptoms, with the only real dference being the time it takes for some customers to notice the effects.. What is CBD oil Cannabidiol, or CBD for short, is a cannabinoid compound naturally occurring in the cannabis plant.  It has been shown to have a iety of benefits for acute and chronic conditions related to pain, sleep, mood, memory, and appetite.Its important to note that CBD is dferent from THC , the main psychoactive compound found in cannabis sativa and responsible for the \"high\" associated with marijuana use.The best CBD oils are created by extracting cannabidiol from the cannabis hemp plant using an extraction method that is solvent free. After the extraction process, the CBD oil is combined with an MCT oilto enhance its bioavailability and promote more efficient absorption.. What are CBD capsules made from  Do they contain THC Overall formulas y company to company, but generally, CBD capsules consist of a pure CBD isolate, broad-spectrum, or full-spectrum formula combined with an MCT oil. The makeup of the capsule itself is based on vegan and gluten-free recipes to not interfere with users dietary restrictions or lestyles.Some forms of CBD capsules may contain trace amounts of THCmade using a full-spectrum formula. However, in the UK, the law mandates that no CBD product contain more than mg of THC per bottle, meaning that the amount of THC in each capsule is incredibly tiny.With that in mind,you prefer to avoid any risk of ingesting THC, consider purchasing CBD capsules made using broad-spectrum or CBD isolate formulas as they have been ultra-refined to remove any traces of THC from the product – and always check the lab test!. Who benefits the most from using CBD capsules While everyone can benefit from CBD using convenient softgel capsules, users looking for a convenient way to dose CBD without tasting the hemp flavors or fussing with droppers in oil tinctures will find using CBD capsules to be an excellent way to meet their health and wellness needs.Additionally, those looking for a very low dose of CBD may be more likely to take advantage of the ultra-low strength capsules, which can contain an amount of CBD as low as mg per capsule..

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values. They are that memorable phrase we hear our elders say once they have explained its meaning to us, we are unlikely to forget it.Theyto us often and roll off the tongue.One of the most important collections of Gaelic proverbs was published in  by Alexander Nicolson .However, Nicolson was merely re-printing a collection made by Donald Macintosh, a Perthshire-born clergyman, first printed in Edinburgh in . Nicolson called the collection “a genuine product of the past” with Macintosh merely acting as collator and translator. of Islay, perhaps coined in the times when the MacLeans, MacDonalds, and later Campbells feuded over the island the second one is a rhyme about the MacAlpines, their former seat in Dunstaffnage, and their ancient claim to the throne of Scotland:When the natives forsake Islay, farewell the peace of Scotland!Children of the native kings, Who reigned down at Dunstaffnage, Who first the crown of Alba owned, And still have native claim to it..It also tells us that there are always grave, far-reaching political consequences whenever an indigenous population is forced to abandon its home.as a hereditary right can last for centuries. The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good. Psychologically and spiritually, we inherit their trauma physically, as the proverb reminds us, we may inherit their medical conditions.By accepting the full extent of our inheritance – strength and weakness, the beautul and the ugly – we grow closer to our ancestors and empower ourselves to heal from what they could not.has always been characterised by plurality and complexity, reflecting the complex Gàidhealtachd to which it belonged.For centuries, fostering children has been an important feature of Gaelic society, and for all the influence that DNA can have on us, the nurture we receive during our formative years has just as much –not more – influence on who we become within our community.In a changing world, it is inspiring to see people across the Gàidhealtachd connecting with the cultural ‘mycelium’ of their place and rooting themselves in it, whether it is their ancestral homeland or adoptive home.can be a wellspring of transformative energy for place-based revitalisation.Sometimes it seems to burst like lightning, explosively cleaving through adversity.

Beth Adger.The works will take place between Aghacully Road and Hazelbank Road and will involve the creation of a high friction surface.Cllr. Adger said a deputation from Aughafatten area residents had told her of their fears about speeding in the area.They were fearful that accidents were on the increase and were pleading for something to be done to eradicate the problem.I sought the support of DFIand I’m delighted to receive this week a positive response from them. Work will begin on March .She added: With a long history of proven success in improving road safety and saving lives, high friction surfacing benefits both road users and pedestrians, particularly in dangerous conditions such as adverse weather.High friction surfacing is a material and a process by which road surfaces become less prone to skidding and loss of friction. Instead of a smooth and slippery surface, high friction surfacing creates thousands of tiny contact points, known as a micro-texture. This means that a vehicle’s tyres have more contact with the road, allowing them to better grip the surface and come to a safer stop.

That’s according to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, who was speaking after the ferry operator sacked  staff yesterday. It could be another week before the firm’s ships will be able to operate again and Mr Poots has warned that goods normally coming here wont be able to get in. There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which wont get out. About % of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us, he told BBC NIs The View. Meanwhile the Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon MLA, has expressed her concern at the actions by PO Ferries and the impact locally. The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London. With the Economy Minister I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes."},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs emma vardy is on the crest of a wave and set to tie the knot at co antrim fairytale castle","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Employers by now should have learned the lessons from home working and the Department for the Economy should provide a wide range of guidance to them, in order to encourage people to continue working from homenecessary and required.”People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said, given that the virus is still circulating and many employers are facilitating flexible working he finds it “astounding that the Minister responsible for workers has put nothing in place and has shrugged his shoulders to the extra costs people are faced with at this moment.”“People are working home for a number of reasons and are experiencing higher bills due to the nature of energy prices shooting up,” he said.It’s unacceptable that workers are forced to stomach these costs. People did what was asked of them during the pandemic- the least the government can do now is to stick by those workers who are financially struggling when working from home. The fact that they haven’t is a catastrophic failure on the Minister’s part.”Related topicsGordon LyonsRachel WoodsStewart DicksonDepartment for the EconomyMore On Gordon LyonsPO will not operate ships from Larne for ‘another week’ according to Economy Minister Gordon LyonsPoliticians from both sides of border tout for business as trade and tourism on agenda in USDUP and Sinn Fein will attend St Patrick’s Day celebrations at White House PremiumEconomy is being distorted by Invest NI focusing on Belfast, claims MLAThe Weekly Political Spin: From Wilson#s Freudian slip and disInvest NI, to delayed reports and DUP unormsMost ReadSchools’ Cup Final: Ben McFarlane the Methody hero as superb second-half comeback earns them record th title with victory over CampbellHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleBelfast city centre incident medical complaint and nothing untowardSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin parade in picturesTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandProtesters demand PO reverses ‘appalling’ decision to sack  workersPoliticians call for emergency joint committee meeting to discuss PO dismissalsProcess to house Ukrainian refugees in Northern Ireland may take only ‘hours’Kevin Hart show sells out in  minutes after surprise appearance announced for Belfast’s LimelightRevealed: Northern Ireland heating oil costs per postcode fall in fortnight but still remain at high levelsLatestMeghan’s debut Spoty podcast series to launch this summerTory MP jeered and told ‘shame on you’ at protest against PO Ferries sackingsJosh Adams praises Louis Rees-Zammit as wing prepares for Wales Local newspaper giant Newsquest seals deal to snap up rival ArchantEmma Vardy#s wedding, St Patrick#s Day and the Schools# Cup ...

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”. It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadSchools’ Cup Final: Ben McFarlane the Methody hero as superb second-half comeback earns them record th title with victory over CampbellHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleBelfast city centre incident medical complaint and nothing untowardDUP deputy leader Paula Bradley stepping away from politics to care for elderly parentsTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandSacked PO seafarers voice anger at Larne Port protestProtesters demand PO reverses ‘appalling’ decision to sack  workersPoliticians call for emergency joint committee meeting to discuss PO dismissalsProcess to house Ukrainian refugees in Northern Ireland may take only ‘hours’Kevin Hart show sells out in  minutes after surprise appearance announced for Belfast’s LimelightLatestJustice Secretary blocks bid to move sadistic killer to open prisonScotland’s ‘super sponsor’ scheme opens for Ukrainian refugeesJoris MinneOpinionRestaurant review: Ulster University’s Academy Restaurant is a practice in the culinary artsEimear McGovernOpinionWhy I’ve decided to embrace looking on the bright side of le ahead of my big dayJack Leach and Ben Stokes strike as England make inroads into Windies batting,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries,” the company said.“These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options.”Unions representing the seafarers told members to stay on board, but those stepping off the ship said they had little choice but to leave after being confronted by the security staff and warned they were trespassing, and that the redundancy package would be withdrawnthey did not do so.Local politicians reacted with shock at the developments. It also caught industry insiders completely by surprise.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, who spoke with chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, said he was assured the jobs of ground staff at Larne were secure, but added he was “appalled” at the treatment of the seafarers.“The way in which staff were removed from the ships is totally unacceptable and is not how any employer should treat their employees,” Mr Wilson said.“Despite operating purely between UK ports, PO will now be paying Third World wages to their crew.“This raises serious concerns about the company’s morality.”Immediate clarication is needed over the future of Larne Harbour, East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said.“Given PO owns Larne Harbour, urgent questions now need asked as to the potentially vast impact locally,” Mr Dickson said.Passengers, hauliers and cargo are being redirected to Stena Line ferries, with the company saying it is trying to accommodate but is extremely busy. It confirmed it was trying to accommodate those booked on the PO ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Most freight companies have accounts with all ferry operators and they are doing what they normally do during periods of disruptions and move via alternative routes operators where space is available,” Stena Line said.Logistics UK, the trade body for freight transport, warned there will be disruption but that those in the business of moving goods were flexible and used to quickly switching methods, either using other ferries or,needs be, air transport.But Seamus Leheny of the organisation said: “This has just come out of the blue... really shocked the industry.”Rail, Maritime and Transportunion general secretary Mick Lynch said: “We are seeking urgent legal action and are again calling for the Government to take action to stop what is fast turning into one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations.”Tom Long of law firm Shakespeare Martineau said: “PO’s decision to fire  staff with immediate effect appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy.”Related topicsJohn StewartAlliance PartyStewart DicksonMore On John StewartJohn Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Birth Mothers, which represents mother and baby homes victims, urges Stormont to act on ’s recommendations PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionProtocol meeting: Stormont ide is clear in discussions with EC vice presidentDoug Beattie includes Mike Nesbitt and John Stewart in UUP spokespeople changesDoug Beattie includes Robbie Butler and Andy Allen in UUP leadership team Most ReadSchools’ Cup Final: Ben McFarlane the Methody hero as superb second-half comeback earns them record th title with victory over CampbellHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleBelfast city centre incident medical complaint and nothing untowardSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin parade in picturesTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandSacked PO seafarers voice anger at Larne Port protestProtesters demand PO reverses ‘appalling’ decision to sack  workersPoliticians call for emergency joint committee meeting to discuss PO dismissalsProcess to house Ukrainian refugees in Northern Ireland may take only ‘hours’Kevin Hart show sells out in  minutes after surprise appearance announced for Belfast’s LimelightLatestJoris MinneOpinionRestaurant review: Ulster University’s Academy Restaurant is a practice in the culinary artsEimear McGovernOpinionWhy I’ve decided to embrace looking on the bright side of le ahead of my big dayJack Leach and Ben Stokes strike as England make inroads into Windies battingUkraine ‘humbled’ by , Britons wanting to open homes to Ukrainian refugeesUK records warmest day of the year with more spring sunshine in store,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One of them was actually a shepherdess in Syria, so she was asking my husband loads of questions.There’s beautul views down here, and she said to us ‘That’s what Syria would have looked like before the war’.That just shows the therapeutic power of doing this.Another lady who was part of that group was , she just sat by the woodburner to keep warm and have a cup of tea.But it was nice for her just to have a dferent space to relax in.”With the likelihood that some of those displaced from the current war in Ukraine will come to Northern Ireland, Malini said projects like Glenside Farm could offer friendship.“For these families that are displaced and come to Northern Ireland, or even foster families, they’re doing it alone,” she said.So being able to come to our farm can offer a sense of community.”Iain said that while the enterprise was still starting out, the couple were excited for its potential.Following lockdown, we realised that people in urban areas needed to be out and about for their mental health,” he said.We thought we have a lovely setting and quality animals for people to come out and enjoy being around.“We realised we could use the farm for other peoples’ benefits, a social enterprise that would facilitate access.Still maintaining a career as a barrister in London, Iain says he is amazed that he manages to keep everything going.It’s still early days, we’ve established the enterprise and Malini is taking the lead on developing programmes.It’s exciting now that she’s able to develop this full time, to facilitate access for vulnerable children and adults.”Most ReadSchools’ Cup Final: Ben McFarlane the Methody hero as superb second-half comeback earns them record th title with victory over CampbellHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleBelfast city centre incident medical complaint and nothing untowardDUP deputy leader Paula Bradley stepping away from politics to care for elderly parentsTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandSacked PO seafarers voice anger at Larne Port protestProtesters demand PO reverses ‘appalling’ decision to sack  workersPoliticians call for emergency joint committee meeting to discuss PO dismissalsProcess to house Ukrainian refugees in Northern Ireland may take only ‘hours’Kevin Hart show sells out in  minutes after surprise appearance announced for Belfast’s LimelightLatestJoris MinneOpinionRestaurant review: Ulster University’s Academy Restaurant is a practice in the culinary artsEimear McGovernOpinionWhy I’ve decided to embrace looking on the bright side of le ahead of my big dayJack Leach and Ben Stokes strike as England make inroads into Windies battingUkraine ‘humbled’ by , Britons wanting to open homes to Ukrainian refugeesUK records warmest day of the year with more spring sunshine in store,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

plans for a major walking trail which passes through Down District have received a pound, boost.A key component of the planned Columban Way is to develop ldquopilgrimage walking such as that found at Spainrsquos Camino de Santiago and at many other trails across Europe, with the trail highlighting Northern Irelandrsquos ancient heritage, including major Neolithic and early Christian sites along the way.It has been confirmed that a pound, grant has made available by the David Cross Foundation to produce a business case with costings to identy and develop the Columban Way from Dundrum to the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick and from there to Comber by repurposing and upgrading sections of the former Ulster Way which was abandoned in the s.St Columbanus was one of the best-known of hundreds of Irish monks following in the footsteps of Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity, literacy and learning to Central and Northern Europe in the sixth century.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright mdash who is an enthusiastic supporter of the new trail mdash said ii took St Columbanus  years to complete the journey from Bangor to Bobbio in Italy and he travelled more than , miles, mostly on foot.He is leading the local aspect of the project alongside Charlie Reid from Bangor, with both writing extensively on walks around Ireland and are committee members of Friends of Columbanus. They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe.

Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three.

Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

show.They danced a sultry tango to Rio by Duran Duran with judge Arthur Gourounlian commenting after: ldquoMatthew, you brought the passion of Rio to the dance floor tonight.Fellow judge Brian Redmond said: ldquoYou started with intensity, commitment to the movement... its just the face thats missing at this stage, your body brought us on the journey.Loraine Barry, another judge, said: ldquoI like this Matthew, I felt you got yourself in the correct tango position.They scored  from the judges but they picked up extra points in the team dance for their group,Turkish Delights, were victorious.These points, combined with the public, kept Matthew safe from the dance-off.Nicolas Roche became the latest celebrity to exit as he and dance partner Karen Byrne lost out in this weeks

intense and there is a lot of pressure because yoursquove got the whole nation watching you and yoursquove got the producers and your fellow contestants watching and you donrsquot want to let the

every day. I havenrsquot taken a day off in ten weeks.Matthew revealed he has met Laurarsquos parents and that he was planning what he called ldquoa two-person trip once the show comes to an end.When askedhe ever expected to get to the quarter-final of the show, he said, \"Itrsquos amazing to get this far. I had no expectation coming into it.\"I was never a performer, never danced in my le so it was a whole new world. Going into the show Irsquom rsquo \" so I never expected myself to be a good dancer, Irsquom not saying Irsquom a good dancer now but Irsquove definitely improved leaps and bounds since I started.ldquoIrsquom really buzzing at how far Irsquove progressed and hopefully Irsquoll keep that going and improve further from here.He said that he has found the physical demands of dance quite challenging and that his body is breaking down now.ldquoItrsquos constant because yoursquore twisting your body in new ways.

The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives.

I married Dominic Giacoppa’s daughter.”The remark drew laughter, but according to some online sources, it was incorrect.The Washington Examiner, a conservative US news magazine, reports that “Giacoppa was actually first lady Jill Biden’s grandfather, not her father”.Giacoppa was apparently the Ellis Island spelling of Giacoppo, the name of the First Lady’s grandfather Domenico.The surname was later Anglicised to Jacobs.The Washington Examiner adds: “Biden has made the Giacoppa joke in the past, including at an opera ball hosted by then-Italian Ambassador Claudio Bisogniero in .”Whilst Joe Biden has often extolled his Irish roots, the surname appears to be of Anglo-French derivation, according to www.houseofnames .Mr Biden went on to say : “I’m the proud son of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden.“And like so many Americans of Irish heritage, I love Ireland and I was raised in a circumstance where you would have thought my whole family — none of — they came in  and , but you’d think they’d all lived in Ireland the last  years — the previous  years...“Irish Americans think they’re more Irish than the Irish.“And — but that’s kind of how I was raised, like so many Americans of Irish heritage — like other people of other heritage as well...“And — but, you know, the faith we share with one another and the resilience that we’ve all gone through, both in America and in Ireland, you know, are ones that we’ve been knocked down sometimes.

The closure of much of the travel sector inevitably caused lasting damage to the industry.Another relevant issue is the outworkings of Brexit. Critics of the UK departure from the EU love to talk of consequences such as the reduced flow of immigrant labour, but there was in fact always a coherent case to be made in favour of the very opposite — strictly controlled external UK borders and increasing reliance on domestic employees, partly achieved by wooing some of the economically inactive population back into jobs. In core respects, such a vision is the very opposite of PO’s apparent blueprint for its future as a ferry company.Companies at times have to slash overheads. They even go unavoidably bust. But they should do all they can to ensure a slow and transparent transition to any new dispensation.Meanwhile, as an absolute minimum gesture the PO severance package needs to be generous, as it was implied yesterday it will be.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Flybe CEO, Dave Pflieger, said: “Next week is going to be an exciting time for customers and communities that have been waiting to hear from us about low fares, new routes, and new destinations—all of which are being timed to coincide with the restart of the economy and ato normality after two dficult years for all. “As you’ve heard, our team has been working hard for over a year and a half to bring customers a new airline that people will love, and we are particularly excited to be flying to Belfast City Airport and serving Northern Ireland. “Once we start flying from Birmingham, Belfast, and many other cities in the UK and EU, we are confident that a new and improved Flybe will provide customers with great value, more choices, and the opportunity to quickly and more conveniently visit loved ones, go on holiday, and more easily visit customers or attend important meetings. “Given that goal, Flybe hopes to do its part to help communities across the country bounce back from the dramatic impact of the global pandemic.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbdddedd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeebcaacd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1647524935354.jpg--goods_for_ni__won_t_be_able_to_get_in__after_p_o_temporarily_halt_larne_sailings.jpg?164752493500","title":"goods for ni won t be able to get in after p o temporarily halt larne sailings ","story":"Supplies coming into Northern Ireland will almost certainly be affected by the decision by PO to temporarily halt sailings at Larne Port as other ferry operators are “pretty near full”. That’s according to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, who was speaking after the ferry operator sacked  staff yesterday. It could be another week before the firm’s ships will be able to operate again and Mr Poots has warned that goods normally coming here wont be able to get in. There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which wont get out. About % of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us, he told BBC NIs The View. Meanwhile the Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon MLA, has expressed her concern at the actions by PO Ferries and the impact locally. The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London. With the Economy Minister I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edaabacfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efddffccdcea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
