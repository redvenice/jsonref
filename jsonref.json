It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Gambling addict inspired Sheridan Smiths ITV drama left suicidal racking debts","story":"    In the popular new series, Sam, played by Sheridan Smith, (pictured) works as an office cleaner, while battling a serious debt problems due to her gambling addiction          Kelly Field (pictured) used her experience and struggles with gambling addiction to help writers and producers at the show develop Smith\u0027s characterThe mother-of-one from St Helens, Merseyside, told The Mirror, said: \u0027I almost lost my life to my gambling addiction.

When the boys and their football coach went missing in the Tham Luang cave on Saturday afternoon, doctors had told them not to worry — people could survive for days without food, as long as they had water, which the boys did.But now it was Wednesday, Day Five. Doubts were growing. Were their boys still alive? For 16-year-old Night\u0027s dad, this was when his hope started to waver. It was hard not to imagine their weak little bodies wasting away in the darkness. What were they doing? Were they scared? How long could they survive?The father of Biw had already felt despair after going into the flooded cave to help with the rescue, feeling the chill of the thin underground air and seeing the water rushing relentlessly in. But he was determined to at least bring his son\u0027s body home for a funeral.For the rescuers, conditions were not improving. The SEALs of the Thai Navy\u0027s Special Forces heading the operation set their sights on at least getting to the T-junction — a crucial landmark a mile or so inside the complex cave system that snaked through the mountain.

You\u0027re risking your life for an if...\u0027Brothers of England football stars Marcus Rashford and Trent...Share this articleThere was also a gloomy feeling among the British specialist cave ers, who\u0027d arrived to take part. Having seen how quickly the cave had flooded, they seriously doubted that the 12 boys of the Wild Boars soccer team and their coach could still be alive.Yet no one was prepared to give up. The urge everyone felt to rescue them was too strong. Thousands of people were now involved in the international operation, backed by volunteers.Food trucks, including mobile kitchens sent by the King of Thailand from his palace, served 20,000 hot meals a day. Giant vats of curry were stirred with cricket stump-sized ladles.Rescuers had their pick of batteries, socks, underwear, painkillers, balms, soap, sweets. Next to the medical tent, masseuses gave free neck rubs to relieve stress. Hairdressers offered to cut hair.Off site, more generosity went largely unseen. Hotels, resorts and village homes opened their doors for the rescue teams, providing accommodation, meals and washing clothes, also for free.  The story of the 12 Thai schoolboys trapped in a cave became a world-wide phenomenon Flagging morale among the Thais was revived when a revered Buddhist monk came, meditated at the cave entrance and appealed to the spirits of the Mountain of the Sleeping Lady to let the boys out.He declared: \u0027Don\u0027t worry — in a day or two the children will come out\u0027. When the parents heard the prediction, their hopes rose again.But the best omen of all was that the monsoon that caused the flooding had stopped and the ers could get back in the cave. Meanwhile, on the mountain, drilling teams set up machinery to bore holes, down which a microphone could be dropped to listen for life.They could only make an educated guess as to where in the cave complex the boys might be.But at the very least, they argued, they would make a racket with their drills, and the sound would vibrate and echo through the porous limestone. This would send a message to the Wild Boars that help was coming. \u0027If I was in the dark for six days,\u0027 an engineer explained, \u0027I imagine I might lose hope, so we drilled to make noise and keep the kids hopeful.\u0027And indeed, inside the cave, amid the constant dripping of water and the thuds and scrapes of their digging, sometimes the boys did hear sounds. One day, Titan thought he heard a helicopter. Biw heard a rooster crow. Another time, a dog barked — they all heard that one.          Rescuers are seen walking towards the entrance of the cave complex during the rescue operation Where were the sounds coming from? Were their minds playing tricks on them? Some of the noises gave them hope, but others scared them. On the ledge deep inside the mountain, \u0027sometimes we heard people\u0027s voices talking at the bottom of the mound but we didn\u0027t see anyone there,\u0027 said Biw.Even more frightening was the unnerving sound of someone calling their names. It summoned up Thai horror stories of ghosts. \u0027Coach Ek told us that if we hear somebody call our names at night, don\u0027t answer,\u0027 said Biw.There, inside the cave, time was running out, literally. Of the three watches the boys went in with, only one was still working but it at least enabled them to have some kind of routine in the darkness.In the morning, they would fill their stomachs with the water running off the stalactites and then head to the top of the slope to dig at the back, in the hope of finding a route out. When 16-year-old Tee\u0027s watch told them it was night, they lay down on the hard dirt to sleep.It wasn\u0027t comfortable, and they found themselves constantly slipping down the slope.When they slept it was usually in short snatches.But there was something else that kept them awake at night. Even at home, Titan, at 11 the youngest, was a restless sleeper who would sometimes sleepwalk to the toilet. In the cave it was worse. He talked and shouted in his sleep, keeping the others awake.Sometimes he would even jump up, still fast asleep, which was annoying but also potentially deadly. If he wandered off, he might hit his head or fall into the water. So every night, Coach Ek would hold on to him, sleeping lightly, wary his youngest player might dream himself to death.          All 12 players, pictured from top left clockwise, Adul Sam-on, 14, Panumas Saengdee, 13, Sompong Jaiwong, 13, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Pipat Bodhi, 15, Peerapat Sompiangjai, 16, Pornchai Kamluang, 16, Prajak Sutham, 14, Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, 11, Mongkol Boonpiam, 14, Nattawut \u0027Tle\u0027 Takamsai, 14 and Duangpetch Promthep, 13They still had working torches, but they rationed the light, knowing it could be many more days until they were found. Most of the time they were in a darkness so profound it felt like a physical substance, oozing around their bodies. It started to get into the boys\u0027 subconscious minds. One night, Dom dreamed he was being chased by a black tiger. Another time Titan thought Coach Ek was a warrior chasing him with a sword.The line between sleep and wakefulness was often unclear in that darkness and all the more terrifying.As the days dragged on, all of the boys had moments of despair and shed some tears. But Note wept more than the others. He simply didn\u0027t think they were going to get out alive. On July 1 it was his 15th birthday but there wasn\u0027t much to celebrate. They were alive, but for how much longer?After nine days, they were inching closer towards death, their bodies wasting away, their cheeks hollow, their skin grey. With no food to turn into energy, their bodies\u0027 normal chemical processes slowed and then shifted, seeking sustenance elsewhere. The protein in their muscles was broken down into glucose, their fat turned into fatty acids and ketone. To fuel the life-giving fundamentals, their bodies were consuming them from the inside.The heart must keep pumping blood. The brain must keep thinking. They must stay calm, conserve their energy. They must survive.For the rescuers outside, Sunday, July 1, brought a lucky break. The weather was easing. There had been no substantial rain for the past 36 hours. That afternoon, yellow measuring sticks at various points within the cave showed the water level dropping.With the cave still flooded, but the flow becoming more manageable, foreign e instructors based in Thailand volunteered to go back in to lay down hundreds of yards of guide ropes through the flooded passages, tying them to stalactites and rocks as they edged once again towards the T-junction.          Thousands of rescuers including Thai Navy SEALs and elite British ers had been working around the clock to come up with a plan to bring the exhausted and starved boys home safelyExperienced British ers John Volanthen and Rick Stanton joined them. Visibility was still poor and ing blind put them on edge. When they bumped into any object in the water they half expected it to be a body. They were constantly bracing themselves for the worst.But they were making progress and eventually battled their way through the cave to the T-junction. There was real hope at last.For the parents outside, though, the mood had turned grim again. Ten days had now gone by. It was too long. They were all miserable and exhausted, stuck in a gut-wrenching place somewhere between doubt and grief.A doctor reckoned that, after ten days without food, the chance of a child surviving was down to 10 per cent. Even those optimists in charge of the operation were wondering if it was time to switch from a rescue strategy to a recovery one. That would be a different dynamic. A rescue operation involved pushing the limits of safety and putting lives on the line for someone else\u0027s. The retrieval of bodies would be a slower effort, performed with care so as not to lose any more lives.On the other hand, the boys and the coach might still be alive. They\u0027d give it another day. This was still a rescue effort. Just.That night, it rained again, but the pumps installed in the cave did their job. The water didn\u0027t rise. The levels were finally under control. The ers pushed further on into the cave. The precise location of the Wild Boars was still a guess.Along the way though there were scattered clues such as muddy handprints on the cave wall that seemed to indicate they had turned left at the T-junction and were probably somewhere near a cavern known as Pattaya Beach.But what state would they be in? Would they even be alive?           The mission to rescue the final four boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave  seen here in a picture posted on Twitter by US billionaire Elon MuskJohn Volanthen and Rick Stanton now started from the T-junction, laying guide ropes as they went, until they came to a diamond-shaped pinch-point. They swam through it, jamming their fingers into the silt to crawl forward against the current.They reached a big sandy slope and came up for air. They had reached Pattaya Beach — the chamber where everyone expected the boys to have holed up.But the ledge was empty. No one was there.Having used a third of their air supply already, they should by rights have turned back, but they made a calculated decision to dig into their reserves of air and keep going. With time running out, they were determined to go as far as humanly possible that day.The boys had been trapped for ten days without food. The idea of stopping just short of them was preposterous, thought John. The two ers pushed on with a sense of determination, but also with dread. \u0027I was absolutely expecting to find bodies in the water floating towards me,\u0027 said John.As they entered each new sump, they had little idea what was in store. Would it be a mere puddle or a long, flooded chamber? Would it be blocked with rocks, stalactites, debris or corpses?Navigation was difficult in the murky passages and they made slow progress for 350 yards until they came to a room-sized chamber and surfaced. There was nothing on the steep muddy bank so they ed again and went on.On the next ledge along, 11-year-old Titan, the youngest of the Wild Boars, was fading, his tiny body wasting away. \u0027I felt faint, I lacked energy and I was hungry,\u0027 he recalled. He was thinking about home-cooked food.Food fantasies played on the boys\u0027 minds constantly. It had been about 245 hours since any of them had eaten. Their faces were gaunt, their cheekbones protruding.Their decline was not just physical. As another day passed, their spirits were fading, too.\u0027We were losing patience, hope, physical energy and courage. We could not do anything to help. The only thing that I could do was pray,\u0027 said Adul, the only Christian of the group.          The 11th boy to have been rescued was reportedly 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungruang (second left), whose nickname is TitanFor the team\u0027s captain Dom, tomorrow would be his 14th birthday. He rallied the boys and urged them to keep digging to break through the back wall and find a way out of the cave. He didn\u0027t know it, but his birthday present was about to come early.At around 8pm, the boys and Coach Ek were up on the ledge, some digging, others resting. \u0027At that moment, I heard people talking,\u0027 said Adul.They all froze in the darkness, straining to hear and fearing their minds were playing tricks on them. Adul grabbed a torch and took off down the slope as fast as his weak body would carry him.As he got to the edge, his legs went from under him and he slid into the water. He clambered back on the ledge, looked behind him at the water and saw, to his amazement, two men in ing gear.\u0027It was a miracle moment,\u0027 he remembered. \u0027I realised they were British and so I just said hello.\u0027By this stage, the rest of the team had scrambled to the edge.From the water, Rick Stanton counted them as they came down. As he scanned his torch across their faces, he saw they were all there. \u0027Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,\u0027 the boys chorused at him.Adul and Biw, the only two English speakers, translated for the others. Adul asked, \u0027When will we go outside?\u0027 and John had to explain that it would not be today. But many people would come to rescue them, he promised. \u0027We are just the first.\u0027The British ers hauled themselves onto the opposite bank, but to begin with stayed separated from the boys by a channel of water.It was a deliberate precaution. They had no idea what state of mind the boys and Coach Ek would be in. They feared that, starving and desperate, they might to try to rush them and grab their ing gear to escape. But after a few minutes, they quickly realised the 13 were calm and posed no threat.For the next 40 minutes, John and Rick sat with the Wild Boars on their ledge. To raise the kids\u0027 spirits, they asked them to cheer for the camera — a cheer for Thailand, a cheer for America, another for the UK, and on it went.The boys\u0027 physical condition was remarkably good. They were gaunt but uninjured and didn\u0027t appear sick. They even managed to smile, though when they did their teeth looked oversized in their pinched faces,\u0027We\u0027re hungry,\u0027 a boy pleaded. \u0027We have to eat, eat, eat!\u0027 The ers hadn\u0027t brought any food with them but promised they would send the SEALs in with supplies as soon as possible.Lowering themselves back into the water, they said farewell, and started back through the sump.Carried by the current, their journey back was quicker and slightly less arduous than it had been going.    Thailand erupts in celebrations as trapped football team is freed from cave and rescue chief praises successful missionNews of the boys being found alive had been messaged ahead of them and reached the world before they even got to the cave entrance. All around there were cheers and tears of joy. It seemed the impossible had come true.The priority now was to get back to them with food and medical supplies as soon as possible. The Thais took control and an army doctor, Dr Pak, and three SEALs headed into the cave.It was a difficult journey for them, still having to battle against the current. They were not trained cave ers, the water was cold and the e long. They suffered from cramps and were forced to rest before eventually making it to the ledge. There they reassured the boys they would remain with them as long as needed — even if that meant waiting half a year, until the cave drained.Dr Pak got to work, getting some energy and nutrients into the boys\u0027 systems without overloading them. Their small bodies were in life-support mode, slowly breaking down the fat and muscle to supply a trickle of energy, enough to keep the heart pumping and the lungs expanding.Many of the body\u0027s chemical processes had stopped, changed or reversed.They were at risk of what doctors call re-feeding syndrome — the point of starvation at which too much food too soon could kill them.A sudden rush of glucose would overload the system, sending their phosphate, potassium and magnesium levels into chaos. The result could be delirium, seizures, respiratory failure, heart failure, coma or even death.Although the boys were hungry and longed for rich pork and fast food, they had to be patient. The rescuers had brought little squeezy packets of high-energy gels. These tiny shots of life would have to suffice for now, gradually bringing their bodies back from the brink.Generally their condition was surprisingly good. The doctor examined them and found no serious injuries. They needed medical care, but not urgently.He applied antiseptic solution to the boys\u0027 scratches. \u0027This will kill the infection,\u0027 he told one boy, as he swabbed his foot.\u0027Then once you are out, we will find you a beautiful nurse.\u0027In the outside world, the joy of finding the team alive was the biggest news story on the planet.          Jose Mourinho of Manchester United meets members of the Wild Boars football team from Thailand in October last year Millions of people joined in the relief and celebrated their survival. But for those responsible for getting the boys and their soccer coach out, the unalloyed pleasure didn\u0027t last long.After the news had sunk in, it was replaced by the realisation of how deep inside the mountain the boys were, and how hard it was going to be to bring them back to the surface.People had been rescued from caves, but never had such a difficult set of problems faced a rescue party — the children\u0027s ages their malnourished state the long, flooded route out the uncertainty of the weather.In an ideal world, the teams would be able to suck enough water out of the sumps for the Wild Boars to wade out the way they walked in.But this wasn\u0027t viable — some of the passages were 15ft deep, and more rain was coming.The cautious solution was to wait. The boys and Coach Ek had energy gels, medicine and company.Perhaps they should camp on that muddy bank for the next four to six months, until the rains stopped and the passages drained.The riskiest option was to try to e them out.The Wild Boars could all swim, but none had ever scuba ed. Even for a competent recreational er, the way out was treacherous. For a non-er, it would be almost impossible.All options were on the table, and all were bad.Adapted by Tony Rennell from The Cave by Liam Cochrane, published by ABC Books at £15.99.

Here are 10 French experiences to share with your children Explore William the Conqueror’s NormandyMake history lessons come to life in Normandy with visits to sites including Bayeux and its famous 70-metre tapestry. You can also explore William the Conqueror’s key stronghold of Caen with its impressive château and other historic buildings. Don’t miss L’abbaye aux Hommes and L’abbaye aux Dames, commissioned by William as an apology to the Church for marrying without its official blessing.Go kayaking in the DordogneThe Dordogne offers plenty of gentle kayaking suitable for families. There are many sites along the river where you can hire boats and be picked up at a pre-arranged location according to how far you want to paddle. Depending on your route you’re likely to pass châteaux, wildlife and river beaches where you can stop for a picnic or a swim.Go narrow boating on the Canal du MidiEnjoy life in the slow lane as you cruise along the Canal du Midi from Toulouse to Montpellier. Explore picturesque villages and historic Carcassonne along the way, visit markets, do some fishing or cycling, visit local vineyards in the Languedoc, or simply sunbathe and relax.Cycle the voies vertes of the LoireThere are over 932 miles (1,500km) of voies vertes (cycle trails or greenways) in the Loire. The flat landscape is ideal for families and most rental shops offer tag-alongs and trailers for small children. Along the way you can explore gardens, châteaux and pretty villages and towns. Rent bikes for a day and cycle independently or book a hotel-to-hotel package with luggage transfer – it’s up to you.Climb Mont St MichelFirst inhabited in 966 by Benedictine monks and over half a mile off the coast, this small island with a population of about 50 people welcomes up to 2.5 million visitors every year. There are shops, restaurants, churches and museums to visit, as well as 350 steps up to the beautifully restored medieval monastery and its stunning views.Explore volcanoes in the AuvergneThere are around 100 volcanic peaks in the Auvergne. There’s plenty of hiking available (both gentle and more challenging), but you can also reach the top of the most famous peak Puy de Dôme at 1,465 metres by electric railway, from where you can enjoy panoramic views. Kids will also enjoy Vulcania, an educational theme park devoted to volcanoes.Go to a theme parkDisneyland Paris is France’s best-known theme park but there are many others – Parc Astérix in the Oise celebrates the comic book hero of the same name, while Futuroscope near Poitiers offers rides and shows based on the latest technology. Puy du Fou in the Vendée is different again – it’s a historical theme park with no rides, instead it puts on dozens of spectacular shows every day.Learn to surf in Aquitaine With an almost unbroken line of long, wide, sandy beaches, often with large waves along this coast, Aquitaine is the ideal place to learn to surf with plenty of surf schools offering lessons for all ages. Smaller children don’t need to feel left out though – on many beaches, when the tide goes out, the sea leaves warm, sandy lagoons to splash in and rockpools to explore.Relax in a thermal spa in the PyreneesIn France, spas aren’t just for adults, the kids get to go too! Children are welcome at many of the naturally-heated indoor and outdoor spas in the Pyrenees. Les Bains du Couloubret in Ax-les-Thermes, Ariège, welcomes children from the age of five and Balnéa in Loudenvielle accepts babies from nine months old, with both indoor and outdoor pools just for families.Eat crêpes in BrittanyWho doesn’t love a pancake? Breton crêpes are thin, light and crispy at the edges and come in both sweet and savoury versions. You can eat them just as they come (nature, as they say in France) or with a filling of your choice. Sweet fillings include sugar or honey and a popular savoury option is the galette complète, with ham, Gruyère cheese and egg.

Retailers are battling against rising rents and business rates, a shift to online shopping and waning consumer confidence.JD, which also owns Blacks, Millets, Size and Go Outdoors, expects profits for the year to 2 February to hit the top end of analysts’ forecasts, which range from £325m to £352m, against £295m the previous year. It has 2,180 shops worldwide, including 390 in the UK and Ireland.The retailer credited its decision not to follow rivals into big price cuts, which kept gross profit margins at the previous year’s levels. Its smaller rival Footasylum, the footwear and hoodie chain, issued a profit warning last week, which it blamed on tough Christmas trading conditions that prompted it to slash prices more than expected.She said JD had managed to retain its appeal, especially among younger shoppers, by using tablets in stores and offering exclusive products from premium brands such as Nike and Adidas.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets, said: “To pull off solid like-for-likes without the kind of heavy discounting others have resorted to is impressive indeed something of a miracle in the current environment. It just goes to show if you get the product offering and pricing right and tap into what consumers want, then there is still success to be found.”JD opened its first five stores in the US after buying Finish Line, a US retailer, in September. It converted three Finish Line stores and opened two further JD shops in Houston, Chicago, Indianapolis, Columbus and Washington.Its initial performance has encouraged JD to extend its trial of the JD fascia, and it plans to convert up to 15 further Finish Line stores to JD in the first half of this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90c314476f7d88520feb8342a75a98f36691baa/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83ce7ab1026de43ca572b02fbf45cc39","title":"pessimism clouds uk banking as demand drops","story":"One in three banks suffer a fall in business as Brexit uncertainty, regulation and market volatility bitesBritish banks have suffered their first drop in demand for five years as Brexit uncertainty, regulation and market volatility took their toll.The report said the pessimistic outlook was in line with “subdued prospects for the wider UK economy”, given weak wage growth and the impact that Brexit uncertainty has had on investment.“A combination of macroeconomic and Brexit uncertainty, regulatory compliance and global market volatility are taking a toll on the UK’s financial services sector,” the CBI’s chief economist, Rain Newton-Smith, said.Newton-Smith said the survey results should serve as a warning shot about the UK economy. “Financial services are a bellwether for the wider economy.

Morgan Stanley has already started to slash jobs, according to reports. Bank bonus season tends to coincide with job cuts, as firms make swift changes at the start of the new financial year. “If cuts are announced, they usually occur in the first quarter,” Sirras said. “These businesses do move quickly with these initiatives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9414ec10ae988269b77e46452b43a6de1712ba3/0_0_8098_4860/master/8098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15e37a6263c12ccf16bb14ef13321ecf","title":"sse bulb energy firms low prices uk","story":"A row has broken out between the UK’s second-biggest energy supplier and one of the largest challenger firms over whether small companies are pricing unsustainably or the big six are ripping people off.The renewable energy supplier Bulb criticised the big six for pegging their default tariffs only £4 on average below the government’s price cap, saying they were treating the measure as a target rather than a limit.The firm, which has grown rapidly since it entered the market in 2015 to more than 850,000 customers, accused the large players of “squeezing every last penny they can out of families”.Unusually, SSE has hit back and suggested that smaller rivals are pricing at loss-making levels.Stephen Forbes, the co-head of SSE Energy Services, said companies of differing scale had bunched just below the cap, and rightly so.“It’s plain wrong to present this as a big-six issue. In total, 27 energy suppliers of all shapes and sizes have also set their prices within the same narrow range,” he said.“The reason for this is the cap has been set at a level which does not fully reflect the true cost of providing energy to all customers.”The default tariff offered by SSE is £4 under the cap of £1,337 based on typical energy use, compared with Bulb at £120 below.SSE linked that low pricing to Bulb posting a £23.7m loss for the financial year 2017-18.“That’s its choice and in a competitive market different companies will pursue different strategies, giving customers more options. Time will tell how sustainable these strategies are over the longer term,” Forbes said.He added that “irresponsible” undercharging for energy took a toll on all households, pointing to the string of nine suppliers collapsing in the past year.A  analysis has found the failures will cost at least £80m spread across all energy billpayers, although challenger suppliers argue this is a small fraction of the amount customers pay over the odds for poor-value tariffs from the big six.SSE also claimed that the big six label – a reference to British Gas, EDF, E.ON, npower, Scottish Power and SSE, which together control four-fifths of the market – was “past its sell-by date”.Forbes pointed to customer service league tables, which put SSE and Bulb near the top, with big players languishing in the middle and minnows at the bottom. “There are brilliant large companies and there are terrible small companies, and vice versa,” he said.A planned merger of SSE’s energy supply arm to npower was scrapped last year and the firm has made clear it wants to exit the retail market.Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of energy regulator Ofgem, said last week that the string of small firms going bust “was to be expected” in a competitive market. However, he warned that wholesale costs had increased over the past year and a significant rise in the price cap is coming.Bulb said the big six were ripping customers off and contrasted its growth – from 200,000 to 850,000 customers last year – with SSE losing more than 1 million in the past four years.Hayden Wood, the Bulb chief executive, said: “We disagree with the big six that their prices represent the true cost of energy. Our prices are more than £120 below the price cap but we still make a fair and sustainable profit of £50 from every member.“We have chosen to reinvest this money in growing our business and signing up new members, something we’re unashamedly interested in doing. Every new Bulb member means a greener UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52def9f50aba04c6422f991b986a6e4f93fcaa5d/0_335_4541_2725/master/4541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=996f6f9bf1c1f1581c779a78f1aa76fc","title":"mps may brexit deal elite revolting democracy commons","story":"Parliament has talked about Brexit for too long. We have so far failed to deliver. This week we have a chance to do so. Yet, instead of respecting the mandate of the British people, many MPs appear intent on overruling it.What we will probably see on Tuesday with the vote on the withdrawal bill and amendments around it won’t be an example of parliament “taking back control” from Brussels or government, but parliament usurping power from the people they are meant to represent.How so? In 2015, the major political parties supported the idea of a once-in-a-generation referendum on our membership of the European Union. We pledged to abide by the results. There’s every sign that we may now refuse to do so. This is not a heroic parliament taking away arbitrary power from a monarch or dictator, but parliament wresting power from a government trying to enact the mandate of the people to leave the EU.I intend to support the government in the vote this week because I respect the result given to us by the British people and my own constituents on the Isle of Wight – I would do so regardless of what the referendum result had been. In addition, the only conceivable way of getting Brexit through is with this deal.I have modest sympathy with those who are critical of it. But I agree with MPs who argue for compromise, a case eloquently made by my colleagues Richard Benyon and George Freeman as well as others last week. As percentage wins go, 52 to 48 is a victory, but it is one in which magnanimity would be a useful ingredient. And it may be that in five or 10 years’ time we vote to change the terms. I think the reality one has to face at this late stage is not between a bad deal and a “good” leave, but between this deal and no deal, potentially a second referendum and no Brexit, with the economics and political uncertainty to follow. And as for Northern Ireland, one should remember it is already treated differently in some of its laws and relationship with the Republic of Ireland anyway. Different laws and customs do not prevent it from being an integral part of the UK.As it stands, too many MPs are telling our electors: “When we told you we would respect your opinion on our membership of the EU, we didn’t mean it.” There is no greater proof that Britain is becoming a European state than our elites demanding the people vote again because they do not approve of how the vote went the first time round.Some MPs, such as Tottenham’s David Lammy, are at least honest about it. His message is: let’s just tell the people they are wrong and refuse.I listen to Tory remain leader Dominic Grieve’s legal pedantry and my heart sinks. I don’t know if he more resembles a latter-day Thomas More or Professor Yaffle from the children’s series Bagpuss I used to watch when I was little. His legalistic approach may be impressive, but he has only one emotional aim, and it is to overturn and ignore the wishes of the people of this country. A fine legal mind is being deployed in the pursuit of undermining our relationship with our voters and damaging our democracy.Two thirds of Labour constituencies voted to leave. While some Labour MPs do have principled objections, the majority appear engaged in a crassly opportunistic attempt to bring down the government, despite having nothing to offer and no new ideas.But, of course, challenge any of the obsessive remainers plotting this week’s coup, and they portray themselves as martyrs. Ask them why they ignore the mandate that was given to us and we are accused of bullying. Ask them to explain themselves and they hide behind precedent, or say in mock sincerity: “Well, we’re taking back control, isn’t this what you wanted?” Challenge them as to why they are undermining democracy, and they tut-tut as if that question is not the sort of thing one should be asking.I intend to call this for what it is. Those on all sides of the House of Commons who try, against our manifestos, against the promises we made, to undermine Brexit are not martyrs. They are representatives of an elite that is trying to block Britain leaving the EU.They are not “taking back control”. They are usurping power. This is a revolt of the elites against popular democracy.• Bob Seely is the Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2a0fb0086d6e8949a69ea9b86b61161ac6ff69b/0_172_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72c6e3d662469a4053506123ff90e360","title":"mps voters may brexit deal tuesday vote","story":"MPs must vote for the deal on Tuesday. It’s the only way to move forward in a realistic fashionParliament is about to lie to those who elected it two years ago. It is about to pretend that there is a better way of leaving the EU than is outlined in Theresa May’s deal. It knows there is not. If it votes down May’s deal, it will lie.The deal is not a settlement but a transition. It is a way of moving forward, of leaving the EU pending negotiation of a long-term trading relationship. It is not a compromise but in reality a defeat for the “having our cake and eating it” school of Brexit fantasists. But it is the only deal on offer. All else is a Westminster miasma of personal ambition, party advantage and endemic hysteria. MPs are charged with governing the country well. Never in my experience have they shown less interest in that cause.Last week a still small voice spoke through the gloom. It was of a backbench MP, George Freeman, speaking of his evident despair over Brexit, but of the obligation on an MP to “cross the party ide and embrace the lost art of compromise”. The responsible next step was to leave as pledged by parliament in March, and move on to negotiate a future outside the EU. To vote against the deal was merely to shut one’s eyes and hope someone else gets the blame for the chaos. Fresh hope has been given to the stallers with a “coup” plan from three moderate Tories, Nicky Morgan, Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles. Assuming May’s plan fails on Tuesday – and they will be voting against her deal – they want a three-week delay, another vote and then the chairs of parliament’s committees to decide what to do next. This might mean another referendum, which is just a can-kicking exercise, or renegotiation on a single market or customs union terms. It would almost certainly mean postponing EU departure. Tuesday’s opportunity to move forward would be lost.The parliamentary coup is a desperate stagger through a quagmire. It further excuses MPs from confronting reality and sustains their mendacity. The leavers want a hard Brexit, on the pretence that the referendum was a vote for tariffs, hard borders and passport controls. All poll evidence says it was not. Remainers cling to the pretence that the referendum was not sensible and, by some device, can be reversed. It cannot.The polarising tendency of modern politics, the aversion to responsibility, compromise and common sense has never been so glaring. MPs should vote for the deal and do what they were elected to do, which is govern the country. If not, they will present the country with a profession in disarray."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab86a25fe8c380ed36957527585f7c0cebce17b2/0_349_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f8ea2f9d1e0f22b71bef1500e596e14","title":"obsessed success early in life sally rooney youth","story":"When 27-year-old novelist Sally Rooney became the youngest-ever winner of the Costa Book Prize last week, it was to deafening cheers of critical acclaim that have characterised her brief career. Rooney has already been heralded as “the first great millennial novelist”, and a “Salinger for the Snapchat generation”. And these Snapchatting millennials have since been overwhelming booksellers in the rush to read their author, prompting shops to advertise that they still have copies of her novel, Normal People, in stock. Yet, for all her obvious talent, the fanfare around Rooney’s award made this millennial’s heart sink slightly.The slightly frenzied reaction to Rooney seems to be symptomatic of the way we now greet achievements by young people. Last year, another 27-year-old author, Daisy Johnson, became the youngest person to be shortlisted for the Man Booker prize for her debut novel, Everything Under. Likewise, some of 17-year-old Autumn de Forest’s expressionist paintings have been valued at $7m (£5.5m), poet Ocean Vuong was only 28 when he won the TS Eliot prize for his debut collection in 2017, and Christopher Paolini published the first of his bestselling Inheritance series when he was in his teens. It seems we increasingly celebrate youthfulness as a marker of success in and of itself Teen Vogue’s 21 Under 21 list began in 2017. This year’s cohort includes 11-year-old designer Kheris Rogers and seven-year-old “activist” Havana Chapman-Edwards.Rooney, Johnson and their contemporaries’ acclaim might be well-deserved, but our obsession with publicising youthful achievement has consequences. Anne Helen Petersen’s article on millennial burnout went viral last week for its critique of how the precarious economic environment has led to what she describes as “errand paralysis” in millennials the pressures to succeed at work and in our personal lives – perhaps with stories of 20-something geniuses at the backs of our minds – leave us unable to undertake even the simplest of tasks.The focus on prodigies also means that older artists don’t always get their due. For instance, one of the best albums of 2018 came from 68-year-old bluesman Lonnie Holley. Traded for a bottle of whisky as a child and one of 26 siblings, he uses his gravelly baritone to sing of the injustices of his bewildering life and powerful musical resurrection. Similarly, singer Charles Bradley had to make his living as a James Brown impersonator for most of his career, only releasing his own music at the age of 63 with 2011’s No Time for Dreaming. He released two more records before dying in 2017 at the age of 68. In the art world, the painter Rose Wylie only began being given major solo exhibitions in her 70s.The moral of these examples is out of kilter with the times, and hugely inspiring. It’s not “if you’re lucky enough you’ll be born brilliant”, but “keep plugging away and you’ll eventually find the success you deserve”.The effects of the fetishisation of youth aren’t just felt by onlookers. For the prodigies themselves, the blaze of publicity isn’t always benign. The traumas of child stars such as Michael Jackson have been well documented, but last year we were reminded of Lauryn Hill, whose critically acclaimed debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, was released 20 years earlier, when she was 23. It was her only solo album. And after the enormous success of his debut in 1987 at 25 years old, Terence Trent D’Arby claimed recently he has been left with PTSD .I’m not saying we should discourage youthful achievement – but perhaps we ought not to capitalise on it so aggressively when it occurs. The “race to success” is not always worth winning. We should listen to Rose Wylie: “It shouldn’t be about age or gender or anything, it should just be about the quality” – of the work, the life lived, the quieter moments.• Ammar Kalia is a  journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/865e0cd6809aec679ae90dec344d4565d4fd6cb4/0_113_3359_2016/master/3359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27a7b6582066495dddc8a9313c571922","title":"silicon valley marketing student loan","story":"For a good period in the middle ages, Europeans totally forgot how to make concrete. The Roman recipe for the tough stuff – opus caementicium – was lost for roughly 600 years after the fall of the empire, and the modern formula we know and love wasn’t invented for another 300 years after that.I’m telling you this because human progress isn’t linear. It’s fine to go backwards and forwards – to retread old ground and improve old ideas. Yet if someone approached Theo Paphitis with a cinder block tomorrow, he’d rightly tell them to get the hell out of the Dragons’ Den. So why do we keep falling over ourselves to praise Silicon Valley for reinventing concrete – or, if you prefer your analogies more straightforward, the wheel?Last week, the New York Times ran a piece praising a “radically new” fee plan offered by a Silicon Valley-based university. Instead of charging tuition fees upfront, Lambda School allows students to pay back their debts after graduation – charging them proportionally, based on their salary. Sound familiar? Anyone with experience of the English education system will balk at the New York Times’s insistence that Silicon Valley is “breaking the status quo” – this has, after all, been the tuition fee model in England for 30 years.It’s not that this is necessarily a bad idea – the average American graduate owes $37,172 (£30,000) in student loans, with studies predicting that inflexible monthly repayments will mean recent grads can’t retire until they’re 75. Yet it is the language we use to praise these allegedly “new” ideas that needs reform. It’s not “radical” if it already exists.Take, for instance, the ride-hailing app Lyft’s 2017 invention, Lyft Shuttle. For a small fee, passengers share a single car that follows a predesignated route – instead of being picked up and dropped off at their chosen location, they must walk to or from one of the determined stops. It’s convenient! It’s affordable! It’s a bus.Tweets mocking Lyft Shuttle instantly went viral, but there’s actually very little that’s funny about it. Not only is the whole idea arguably classist (online, people have praised Lyft Shuttle for allowing them to get around without sitting next to common riff-raff), in practice, the service could harm investment in existing public transport. As Salon writer Keith A Spencer pointed out in 2017, by competing with existing infrastructure, Lyft Shuttle could leave poorer people with fewer and worse transit options than they had already. Not only is Silicon Valley wrapping up an old idea in a new bow, they’re threatening much-needed public services.Then again, some “inventions” are just funny. Last year, the fashion company Atoms promised to “modernise the footwear experience” by offering tennis shoes in quarter sizes (for the bargain price of £140!). In 2017 a team of Swedish inventors released their Pause Pod – a “private pop-up space” where busy employees could relax, which – yes, yes, you’ve guessed it – was just a tent. “We never claimed that it’s not a tent,” the Scandinavian developers offered in their defence.The examples are in fact endless: in 2017 We Work launched co-living spaces which were essentially just student dorms with added yoga a startup’s brand new Bodega boxes were just vending machines and no one will ever forget Juicero (rest in peace), the £300 machine that – investors realised all too late – essentially just poured juice. Most recently, everyone’s favourite Silicon Valley cyborg, Elon Musk, was mocked for his loop system, which provides underground tracks for cars. Australians felt this borrowed heavily from Adelaide’s O-Bahn system, which has existed for buses since 1986.Again, there’s nothing wrong with attempting to improve old inventions (though I have to politely insist that the relevant parties bring back pre-sugar tax Irn Bru). It’s just egos and the language employed by Silicon Valley are automatically annoying. While products might be marginal improvements on their predecessors, they often come with a host of new problems – such as Lyft’s dystopian insistence that a driver who gave birth on the job was somehow “impressive”, instead of a victim of lax modern labour laws.Not only are these products nowhere near as revolutionary as they sound, these companies and their inventors often ignore the majority of people to improve lives for a privileged minority. They’re too busy operating in a bubble of their own perceived brilliance to know what might work – old and new – in the wider world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ca64d761c1376daec5dc35d75f33dbe35163398/0_164_5377_3227/master/5377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bc2742f657ad72358f7ded931ccb60e","title":"true happiness pessimism negative thinking","story":"Early on New Year’s Day, I began scrolling through the messages people had left on social media. Usually you find a note of hope among popping corks and exploding fireworks. Not this year. All I found were posts like “2018 was a terrible year. Don’t expect more from 2019” or “I dread the year to come”.I started to suspect that those I followed on social media were all just a bit depressing. But that theory evaporated when a new batch of articles trying to capture the spirit of our age appeared. “It’s all over,” one piece declared. “All that’s left to us is making the best of a bad situation,” another announced. A fascinating new book bore the title The Worst is Yet to Come.It seems that 2019 is the dawn of an age of deep pessimism. According to some, things are going down quickly. All we can do is try to survive. The editors of n+1, one of the hippest intellectual journals on the planet, claim that our only hope seems to be that “our arrow-slinging children will bear us on their backs out of the civilization we ruined for them”.Upbeatsters rubbish such dark resignation. Things aren’t actually that bad, they claim. Life s are expanding, GDP is rising, female empowerment is growing, poverty is declining. Even if there are a few pesky problems, such as falling life expectancy among poor people in rich nations due to deaths of despair, that’s no reason for negativity. If we are to believe we can do something about these big problems, we are told that we need to think positively. After all, there is a significant body of work showing that people with an optimistic outlook tend to suffer much less distress when faced with big life events such as childbirth, starting a business or facing a significant illness.In recent years, we have started to recognise the limits of being relentlessly upbeat. There is a growing movement of people prompting us to harness the power of pessimism. Pessimism is experiencing a strange revival in philosophy. Eugene Thacker reminds us that it will all inevitably end in ruin one day. Accepting that insight can give a strange sense of consolation and can free us to live.In self-help circles, people are beginning to embrace negative thinking by turning to stoic philosophers such as Seneca. Instead of closing their eyes and imagining the perfect future, they are sitting back and trying to envisage the worst-case scenario. Rather than envisaging themselves living in a luxury minimalist house in Malibu, these postmodern stoics try to imagine themselves sleeping in a cardboard box outside the downtown Los Angeles bus station.Perhaps the pessimism that infuses our age is not something we should recoil from or wallow in. Maybe pessimism could force us to realistically consider the worst-case scenario. Pessimism could help steel us against the inevitable anxieties that the future brings. A good dose of pessimism may actually motivate us in our attempts to address the problems we face. Pessimism could console and even free us. When mixed with some optimism, pessimism may help us to think more soberly and realistically about challenges that we face. Although being pessimistic is painful, it is certainly better than harbouring delusional fantasies about sunny uplands of the future.• André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b3d805d145d718dd2f963967fd5c3ec8a1dddd/0_170_4728_2837/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1297a71e0f07cf56160daa99033a1ab4","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of contrast","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘contrast’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘contrast’.Share your photos of what contrast means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 16 January at 10am.

Come summer, Alberta’s five national parks become the perfect backdrop for everything from wildlife spotting, cycling and rock climbing to rafting and gazing at the stars in one of the region’s dark sky preserves. But beyond the mountains, you’ll find both small-town charm, such as Lake Louise inside Banff National Park, and cosmopolitan buzz in Alberta’s urban hubs, Calgary and Edmonton.Besides the mountains, the province’s other great natural feature is its prairies. Alberta is cowboy country, and that means beef – namely Alberta’s famous AAA beef – is a staple of menus across the province. Head to the Longview Steakhouse, where the setting is casual but the food hearty and high-end, for a quintessentially Albertan experience with valley views. Or dine amid the forest at Tekarra. This log cabin, perched above the Athabasca River near Jasper, has been serving illustrious patrons, including Marilyn Monroe, since 1952.A new star in the contemporary culinary scene is Deane House. Set in a century-old Calgary mansion, dishes focus on seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Or tuck into the tastiest trattoria-style food at Bread \u0026amp Circus, nominated as one of Canada’s best new restaurants in 2018. And if you want to buy produce, you’re in luck – Edmontonians love a farmers’ market, with no less than 16 held weekly during the summer.It’s not just the restaurants making the most of locally sourced ingredients craft beer and spirits are booming, as entrepreneurs also make use of Alberta’s natural larder. Head to the Park Distillery in Banff for the aptly named Glacier Rye whisky, made with glacier water from Banff National Park. The multi-award-winning Eau Claire – makers of Alberta’s first craft single malt whisky – uses ingredients harvested from farms in southern Alberta.Edmonton’s nickname as “festival city” is well-earned. No matter the season, there’s a festival in town. The Edmonton International Fringe Festival – the largest, longest running fringe festival in North America – is held each August. Watch the streets of Old Strathcona fill with performers, from circus acts to standup comedians. Calgary, too, is no slouch when it comes to getting into the party spirit – it even has its own Music Mile, a mile-long stretch of 9th Avenue SE bursting with music venues, including the Ironwood Stage and Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre. But long before there was a city here in Alberta, bison roamed, and First Nations people lived off the land. Take in 6,000 years of plains culture at the evocatively and aptly named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump cliff. The Unesco world heritage site, 14 miles west of Fort Macleod, was an important hunting site for First Nations communities. Today a visitor centre houses prehistoric artefacts and offers tours of the site.A tri-area lift ticket gets you access to Mount Norquay, Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village – revered by skiers and boarders worldwide as one of the top places in the world to seek out feather-light snow. For the more adventurous, Fortress Mountain, located on the Kananaskis Trail, 70 miles west of Calgary, offers skiers and riders of intermediate-plus level the chance to go in search of virgin snow. Head to Castle Mountain to go cat-skiing, where you’ll have access to untouched powder so dry and light it’s nicknamed “liquid smoke”.If you’re after a more tranquil experience, take to the water in summer. Rent a canoe or kayak in Banff National Park and explore the waterways of the Bow Valley, including 40 Mile Creek and Vermilion Lakes. Or ride the backcountry mountain trails on horseback, camping out in the wilderness with a riding holiday.Alberta’s ski-heaven winters and fine summers may draw the crowds, but make no mistake, one of the best times to visit is autumn. Take a hike up to Larch Valley in late September, starting at the unbelievably photogenic Moraine Lake , to see the trees turn a flaming yellow amid the wisps of the season’s first snow. The two-and-a-half-mile hike will take you from the spectacular turquoise waters backed by the ice-capped Valley of Ten Peaks, up to a high alpine meadow. Then there’s stargazing in Jasper, where you’ll find one of the world’s largest dark sky preserves. Every October, the Dark Sky Festival holds a number of events from symphonies under the stars to rocket building workshops.Of course, winter is magical in the Rockies. And that’s not just because of the skiing: stave off the January blues in Banff with the 11-day long Snow Days Festival, centred around massive snow sculptures in downtown Banff. Or head to Lake Louise for the Ice Magic Festival, as international ice-carving teams compete to create giant sculptures on the frozen lake.Discover more adventures throughout the year in Alberta with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495be7cc8998840d67fe69cc892f561277a83d84/649_224_2851_1710/master/2851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d97f8dfd36c4d0fcdb3c3dd677c03b","title":"universities should give offers after results day says study","story":"Authors argue move would end unconditional offers and aid disadvantaged studentsSchool leavers should apply to universities only after seeing their A-level results, a move that would end the controversial use of unconditional offers, in a major reform of the current system, according to a report backed by university staff.Changes to the timing of the academic year and greater support for school-leavers could also form part part of the reforms, according to the report.The move would end the uncertainties and perverse outcomes that bedevil the current system, including bias in favour of independent school applicants, according to the report’s backers.The reforms, backed by the Universities and College Union, would see school-leavers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland apply for courses after seeing the results of their A-level and BTec exams or other qualifications, rather than applying months beforehand, as is currently the case.But the authors face an uphill struggle winning over educationalists wedded to the current system because of what one vice-chancellor described as “institutional conservatism” among both school and university leaders.Previous pushes for reform, most recently in 2012, have been derailed by opposition from university leaders and the Ucas admissions service. But changes to funding and the removal of institutional limits on undergraduate recruitment have shifted admissions towards the interest of applicants.UCU’s efforts to reopen the discussion were backed by Gordon Marsden, Labour’s shadow higher education minister.“An urgent debate needs to be had on post-qualification admissions. This government has failed to take meaningful action to improve access, and the current university admissions system too often makes it impossible for disadvantaged pupils to reach their full potential,” Marsden said.“From unreliable predicted grades that can underestimate the ability of disadvantaged students, to the skyrocketing number of unconditional offers, the current system is in need of a serious rethink if it is to give every student the chance to succeed.”Currently, sixth-formers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland apply for places on courses by January, months before sitting their exams in early summer. The timing forces applicants and universities to base their decisions on teachers’ predictions of likely grades – despite evidence showing those predictions to be largely inaccurate.By bringing forward the sitting of A-levels and similar qualifications to after Easter, and pushing back the start of term for first-year undergraduates, the authors are confident that the bulk of applications and acceptances could take place in August.The report says that the time between the end of exams and results being published at the start of August should be used to provide high-quality advice to school-leavers on their career options and potential courses.“A higher-education system should be more than a cycle. It should be a set of support structures that enables students to make decisions about their higher-education courses and institutions,” the report, by Nartey and Graeme Atherton of the National Education Opportunities Network, states.Bill Rammell, the vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire and a former higher education minister under Labour, said he strongly supported post-qualification admissions, but thought the report’s proposed term-date changes – with first-year students starting their courses a few weeks after other students – would be unpopular.“We are slowly moving towards post-qualification admissions in any case, because students are now in the driving seats,” said Rammell.Nartey said students would be empowered by knowing their results at the point they applied, and that universities would be able to more easily and quickly select their future undergraduates.A shift to post-qualification applications would also end the process known as clearing, a hurried scramble for remaining places among students who failed to achieve the grades predicted by their teachers, which takes places immediately after exam results are published in mid-August.The change would also kill off the increasing use of unconditional offers by some institutions, which award places to students regardless of their eventual grades. Unconditional offers have been strongly criticised by head teachers as causing disruption in schools and removing incentives for pupils to perform to their best ability.Nartey also said that previous research published by UCU had found that some under-represented groups, including ethnic minorities, were disadvantaged by the existing system, because their predicted A-levels may not have matched their true abilities.“Students aren’t able to be broad or bold in their applications, because they didn’t know what they may have achieved,” Nartey said.A spokesperson for Universities UK – which represents the bulk of British universities – said in response to the report: “One reason universities decided not adopt a new model was because disadvantaged students would not have access to one of their best sources of information for advice on university applications, their school or college, in the time they need to make a decision.“We recognise that there are still challenges to address, including improving information for students and accuracy of predicted grades, and we will be reviewing new information on this topic from Ucas with interest when it is published.”A 2011 study by Ucas found that students from disadvantaged backgrounds were likely to lose out under the current system, because they had less advice and support.Earlier research by UCU showed that the existing application system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is a global outlier compared to other high-performing countries, and the only one to use predicted grades as the basis for admissions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b74b6272422b66d5c67fd25af84f8d7395d559/0_133_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c34de9c9550385e95b6e0ca9366e3e","title":"meet the exeter university youtuber proving the value of connectivity","story":"Being always-on has its plus side. As third-year psychology student Selina Ozay knows, a digital platform can provide powerful opportunities to give back to the communityThere are many things that define the student experience. Getting up before 7am isn’t typically one of them.However, Selina Ozay, a 20-year-old psychology undergraduate at the University of Exeter, isn’t a typical student. As well as preparing for her finals, Ozay runs her own YouTube channel, on which she has built a following of more than 8,000 subscribers by vlogging about uni life, study tips and fashion.It’s a juggling act that requires early starts. But while this might be off-putting for many university students, it fits with Ozay’s personality. Admitting that she didn’t put heaps of effort into her GCSE exams – “I didn’t think they were that important” – she explains she got her act together during her A-levels, and has organised every aspect of her life since.“I’m a massive fan of lists and schedules, and I literally plan everything hour to hour,” she says. “I don’t always stick to it, but it comforts me to have a plan for the day.”With a workload as ambitious as hers, making the most of every moment is essential. For Ozay, learning to manage both a growing YouTube career and an engaged student life (she’s also general secretary of the University of Exeter’s Vegetarian and Vegan Society) has paid off, with her social-media presence leading to friendships and even campus-celebrity status.“Things are a bit more personal online,” she says. Despite claims that social media is killing off real, personal connections, she’s found that being online allows her to “launch into talking about deeper issues straight away”, skipping the shallow pleasantries of face-to-face chit-chat and building meaningful relationships from the jump.“On my YouTube channel I’m really open about being stressed or anything going on in my personal life,” she continues, “so people know me in a different way.” Because of this, connectivity has become Ozay’s lifeblood. An unimaginable amount of content is uploaded to YouTube every day so, to stay ahead of the latest trends, she has to keep a close eye on what her fellow vloggers are putting out there.Her YouTube channel covers everything from how to make friends to dealing with the stress of studying, and she presents an honest and relatable picture of university life. In response, fellow students frequently stop her on campus to tell her what an inspiration she is. “It still shocks me,” she says of her online celebrity.What makes Ozay special is the fact that she doesn’t necessarily see some things that others would call work as work. Describing her morning routine (which, on a good day, begins at 5:30am), she insists she doesn’t do any work prior to starting her lectures, before revealing that she will check emails and deal with her Vegetarian Society responsibilities during this time. In addition, Ozay completes a daily morning workout, which she says is very helpful for managing her stress levels. “I do yoga, so it’s very much about being mindful and focusing on breathing, and it does help me calm down.”The rest of her day is split between YouTube and uni. “It does take up a lot of time. It’s the editing that takes up the most. I just spent three hours editing a vlog in the library. That’s three hours I could spend revising.”There’s not a hint of complaint in Ozay’s tone as she waxes lyrical about her busy life. It’s her passion for helping people that drives her, whether it’s posting study vlogs to YouTube or preparing for a future as a therapist, her current post-university ambition. “I’ve always felt it came naturally to me,” she says of her desire to support others. “I’m a very empathetic person. I cry very easily and I feel what other people are feeling very easily.”A lot is said about the always-on generation, but Ozay proves that it’s the person that makes the (social media) presence, not the other way around. By channelling her driven and caring personality into her online communities, she has created a digital space where friendships can form and support can be found.

The start they received through André Schürrle’s exquisite opening goal was beyond anyone’s expectations, though what followed was all too familiar. Claudio Ranieri claimed his side deserved a point, though he admitted Fulham managed only three goal attempts for all their passing and movement outside the box. “They didn’t ask that many questions,” Sean Dyche said, which was a bit rich coming from the manager of a winning side unable to muster a single shot on target. “We played well, we will not give up,” Ranieri said, putting a brave face on the fact that his side can ill-afford to squander points against fellow strugglers. Fulham did play well, but it is what happens in the final third that counts. Paul WilsonAnother messy refereeing decision, another vote for technology. Confusion reigned after Lee Mason retracted his decision to award Huddersfield a penalty and, as David Wagner said, such a reverse comes at a cost. Would a video assistant referee have aided Huddersfield’s fight for survival? “In general I’m not a fan of it, because it stops the emotions,” Wagner said. “But if you have emotions like I have at the minute and in the past, then yes, it would help.” Huddersfield feel hard done by, with Wagner – without a win since November – referencing Michael Oliver’s failure to give his side a penalty at Brighton last month. “I know the officials do nothing on purpose but it looks extremely unlucky and unfortunate for us,” he added. By the time VAR is introduced in the Premier League next season, it will probably be too late for the Terriers. Ben FisherJorginho’s impact on Chelsea after his arrival from Napoli was a major reason for their successful start under Maurizio Sarri but the manager’s admission that his deep-lying playmaker is “in trouble” after the victory against Newcastle was intriguing given the departure of Cesc Fàbregas to Monaco on Friday. “Have you seen the match? After 20 minutes he lost a lot a balls,” said Sarri. “It’s unusual, so I think maybe he was tired. If Fàbregas was on the bench I think he would have been on the pitch in the second half.” Moves for Cagliari’s Nicolò Barella or Leandro Paredes of Zenit St Petersburg could yet be sanctioned, although Sarri appeared frustrated that he has only a limited say in transfer dealings. “In my opinion we need two players,” he said. “If you ask me something else I don’t know what to answer because I am not in charge of the market.” Ed AaronsWatford’s 2-1 win over Crystal Palace was probably celebrated heartily by most of their players, not least Tom Cleverley, whose winning goal was his first since October 2017 after a year spent on the sidelines with hamstring and achilles problems. But spare a thought for Ken Sema, the man who Cleverley replaced after 68 minutes: not such an unusual thing, until you realise that Sema himself came off the bench, introduced when Will Hughes suffered concussion after a collision with Mamadou Sakho on 19 minutes. Sema was not injured , but did manage to pick up a booking shortly before Javi Gracia decided to replace him, 49 minutes later. “It wasn’t an easy decision but in that moment I thought I had to do it,” Gracia said, when asked about substituting a substitute. “I’m very sorry because I don’t like to do it but I had to do it.” Nick MillerSouthampton’s gutsy 2-1 victory over Leicester felt like the sort of game that they would have lost prior to Ralph Hasenhüttl’s appointment. There was more than half an hour remaining when Leicester, who were playing with an extra man following Yan Valery’s dismissal, halved the deficit and it was easy to fear for Southampton at that point. Yet it says much for the renewed belief that Hasenhüttl has instilled, and in particular the way that the team is organised defensively, that Southampton saw the game out without ever looking that uncomfortable. The Austrian has been in charge for only seven league matches but he has already won as many (three) as Mark Hughes. “The difference has been unbelievable,” said James Ward-Prowse, who scored the opener. “We have a clear structure and a plan of what do with and without the ball.” Stuart JamesThe sight of Romelu Lukaku in tracksuit and raincoat as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial fed off the passing of Paul Pogba pinpointed the most marked change in Manchester United since José Mourinho settled his bill at the Lowry hotel. After returning from the leave of absence he took over Christmas, the Belgian has yet to fit into Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s strategy, which at Wembley seemed little more sophisticated than playing on the break and hitting those fleet-footed forwards as quickly as possible. Despite scoring in his last three matches, a target man does not fit United’s requirements, and just as Solskjær had to accept from Sir Alex Ferguson, goals cannot guarantee a starting place if the team is better served by players who bring more overall. Meanwhile, it remains a mystery why Mourinho failed to see much in Rashford. John BrewinSamir Nasri had a point to prove during West Ham’s impressive victory over Arsenal. Not only was Nasri fuelled by the desire to silence the constant taunts from the away end, where Arsenal’s fans relished the opportunity to jeer a player who left them for Manchester City in acrimonious circumstances in 2011, he was also energised by the task of demonstrating why Manuel Pellegrini was determined to sign him. Given a second chance after returning from an 18-month doping ban, Nasri has embraced the challenge of showing that he has lost none of his technical ability. He still needs games to improve his fitness after his long exile but the Frenchman sparkled in the No 10 role and produced a composed assist for Declan Rice’s winner. Much more of this and West Ham will feel that they have landed the bargain of the season. Jacob Steinberg• Unai Emery knocks Mesut Özil off his star-status pedestal at ArsenalIt was the final bow of Son Heung-min’s extended farewell before he belatedly headed to the Asian Cup. Tottenham will miss the awareness of space and weight of passing that set up Harry Winks for an early, missed chance. With Mousa Dembélé off to the Chinese Super League, Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama still absent with long-term ailments and Moussa Sissoko suffering a hamstring twang in the first half, resources are stretched to breaking point. A quartet of Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Son hauled Mauricio Pochettino’s team through seven wins in eight matches during the most gruelling part of the season but their energy levels have visibly flagged Kane limped off in pain at full-time.

Chelsea were scintillating at Arsenal and Emma Hayes should be lauded for getting her tactics spot-on. They pressed a makeshift Arsenal backline with real ferocity, defending tirelessly from the front and forcing the home side into a first half full of errors. The energy of Beth England, Karen Carney and Erin Cuthbert, who scored their two goals, was fundamental to their approach. It was evident from the opening minutes that Chelsea, who have not lost since going down 5-0 at home to Arsenal on 14 October, were the team with the momentum and that they were attacking something of a wounded animal. The resources on their bench, which was full of seasoned internationals like Fran Kirby and Anita Asante, are astonishing and they are beginning to reap the rewards of the investment they made to bolster last season’s squad. This was their seventh successive league win and they are gunning for honours in all four major competitions. In this form, and with the belief palpably oozing from them, you would not bet against them achieving something special.Arsenal’s lack of squad depth may be starting to tell. Daniëlle van de Donk, who had been in such fine form, joined their long list of injury absentees for the Chelsea game and they also lost Beth Mead at half-time. Their first XI are electric but it is incredibly hard to be at your best when so many important players are missing. They badly missed Van de Donk’s creativity in the first half Vivianne Miedema was starved of service and they could not begin to put it right until too late. Some wizardry from Kim Little, whose recent return does at least ease the strain on the treatment room slightly, teed up Miedema to steer home but Chelsea held firm after that. Joe Montemurro has signed two new defenders recently but they require more options in other positions, perhaps to ease the load on Miedema and their forwards. The points they put on the board during their stunning early-season run ensure they are still in the driving seat but the alarm bells are beginning to ring.That result at Arsenal dangled a huge carrot in front of Manchester City. They capitalised against a West Ham side that tend to give the top teams a decent game, looking far sharper than they had in the wasteful draw at Bristol City and reaching the summit for the first time in 2018-19. West Ham had lost 4-2 against Arsenal the week before and in midweek went down 2-0 against Manchester United in the Continental Tyres Cup, but their heads did not drop here and they fought City all the way. Jane Ross scored against her old club to give them a chance and City were only home and dry when Nikita Parris made it 3-1 near the end. West Ham certainly have character and unity beyond their years, which should stand them in good stead for some real improvement in seasons to come, but City got the job done and their home meeting with Chelsea next month should now be deliciously poised.Marc Skinner would have liked to sign off with a better result but can be proud of the legacy he will leave at Birmingham. Three points against Bristol City would have propelled them into third place, but Blues were lacklustre and only created one real chance to score. It means they remain firm outsiders in the title fight but Skinner, who is heading to the US to take charge of Orlando Pride, has created such a bold and strong identity at the club during his two years in charge of the first team. He will be sorely missed and there will be speculation about his successor, with Mark Sampson among those who may take note of such an enticing WSL vacancy. Bristol City must be praised for mastering the occasion and thoroughly deserving their win the previous week they took an impressive draw against Manchester City and there is a strong sense that this young, tenacious team are on the rise.Liverpool will breathe a sigh of relief after squeezing past Yeovil. Courtney Sweetman-Kirk’s last-minute winner did the job but it was hard on the bottom-placed side, who have a habit of fading in the second halves of games but produced one of their best performances of the season and were moments from avoiding defeat for only the second time.

Experts explain what works and what doesn’tIf you have upped your training routine, returned to exercise after some time off or given a new activity a go, the chances are you have felt the characteristic ache of delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms). Usually kicking in around 24 to 48 hours after exercise, muscles feel tender and sore as a result of microscopic damage to the muscle fibres, which occurs when you force your muscles to work harder than they are used to, or use muscle groups that you don’t often reach in your regular workout. It can leave you feeling achy and stiff, with a walk around the office taking on a John Wayne feel.Any exercise to which you’re unaccustomed can result in a bout of Doms, says Dr Mark Wotherspoon, a consultant in sport, exercise and musculoskeletal medicine. Simply put, he says, it suggests you are “doing too much too soon”.Any changes should be gradual to allow muscles to adapt. “If you don’t get rid of that tightness and allow the muscle fibres to repair, you are more susceptible to injury for a period afterwards.”In the days following the onset of Doms, Anderson says, “don’t hammer the same muscle group again”. Instead, he suggests using other muscle groups for a few days at the gym or, if you’re a runner, simply lessening the intensity. He also suggests incorporating a progressive warm-up, in which movements become gradually more intense, and not to skimp on the warm down. Good quality sleep also plays a factor, when it comes to recovery.Although you will want to go easy on tender muscles, Wotherspoon doesn’t recommend completely abandoning your fitness routine. Instead, he advises incorporating light exercises. “If I ran on Monday and then on Tuesday was sore, I might go for a light bike ride or a little jog on Wednesday,” he says “So, exercising through it isn’t a bad thing, but exercising and ignoring it, and exercising hard, probably is not the best thing.”Do avoid any hard workouts and the temptation to “push through it” when muscles are vulnerable, he says. “Your muscle capability is reduced, your muscle power is reduced and your muscles are tender.”While nutrition can’t prevent Doms as “a natural part of the training adaptation process”, it may help reduce the effects, says sports dietitian and ultrarunner Alexandra Cook. “Most nutritional interventions to reduce Doms are closely related to inflammatory response and aiding the rebuilding of damaged muscles.”She recommends a portion of protein – the main nutrient needed for muscular repair – at each meal as well as snacks to support the recovery and muscle adaptation process. “Regular intake of carbohydrate is vital to replace muscle glycogen depleted during exercise. If you skimp on the carbohydrate, you run the risk of excessive protein (muscle) breakdown, which won’t contribute positively to the training process.”Ted Munson, a performance nutritionist at Science in Sport, agrees that carbohydrate intake is key, although the amount to consume “depends on what you’re doing. If you’re undertaking high-intensity, prolonged-duration exercise like a half-marathon, you may need to consume 8-10g of carbs per kg of body mass per day. For shorter-duration, lower-intensity exercise, the demand may be reduced.”Both Munson and Cook agree that eating something as soon as you can post-exercise is beneficial, with muscles primed to take on nutrients within 30 minutes of finishing exercise. Cook advises a simple carbohydrate and protein-based snack, while Munson suggests preparing a shake in advance both recommend following this with a balanced meal within the next hour.Water is, as usual, key, says Cook. Because muscles are made up of a high percentage of water, “even mild dehydration can make your Doms worse”. But although staying hydrated may reduce symptoms, it won’t speed up repair from muscle damage.Besides nutrition, elite athletes and novices alike swear by a number of recovery techniques, such as wearing compression clothing, using a foam roller and taking ice baths (who remembers the image of Andy Murray in an ice bath, clutching his Wimbledon trophy?) – but their effectiveness is debatable.Anderson is a fan of compression clothing and massage, but advises caution when it comes to foam rollers, which he believes can be “massively overvalued by people ... It’s a very personal thing: some people get on with it very well, some people don’t, some people do too much of it and actually cause more bruising through the foam rolling than they would have caused through the exercise.”Wotherspoon – currently lead medical officer at Southampton FC, and a medical officer for the England cricket team for more than a decade – says that, while compression stockings, ice baths, light exercises and sports massage play a part in the recovery programmes of elite athletes, it may be all in the mind.“There’s some evidence that it doesn’t matter which one of them you use, because the most effective recovery component is psychological,” he explains. “So, in other words, whatever makes you feel better, do. If you’re absolutely convinced that recovery stockings are the thing that helps you, crack on and use them if you want to get in an ice bath, happy days. There’s no good scientific evidence that any one of those is any better.”The best way to deal with Doms is to avoid it in the first place, he says. “If you do a very slow, graduated exercise programme, you’re much less likely to get Doms. It’s all about trying to ease people into exercise at a slow, steady pace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe25bd0a5f614e5cc6cef4df9ac573e906663e2/0_176_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a5798042ba7525adf28d4d5a2e97243","title":"seven ways to improve your sprinting","story":"Get your 100m time down with a mix of strength training and explosive exercises while remembering to relax and stay coordinatedSprinting is very high impact – when elite athletes hit maximum speed in a 100m race, their feet will strike the ground with a force equal to more than three times their body weight. Dina Asher-Smith – who clocked the new British record time for 100m last year, and was the first Briton to win triple European Championship gold – is able to harness the necessary strength and power by mixing track training with gym workouts. Her sessions include weights, squats and core work to condition and strengthen muscles.A huge part of sprinting is about moving your arms as well as your feet. As four-time Olympic sprint champion Michael Johnson puts it: “Think of your arms as your accelerators. Your arms drive your legs, not the other way round.” That means driving arms back as well as forwards for momentum (trying not to let arms swing out to the sides), while keeping shoulders and arms relaxed. Bring knees up high and try to keep your core controlled with a good upright posture.Plyometrics are explosive and intense exercises, such as jumping and skipping, that aim to boost muscle power. They can be beneficial to improving running economy and form. Running coach Nick Anderson says: “Your legs become quicker at landing and pushing off the ground, making you faster and more efficient.” He recommends jumping lunges, toe taps, high skips, bench jumps and calf drives, but not more than twice a week and never after running – it’s best to start with rested legs and to build up the duration and intensity.“Sprinting is all about explosive power making sure you have symmetry in strength is key,” says physiotherapist Laura Jamieson. A simple way to test this is by comparing the strength and distance of a single hop on your right leg with that of your left leg. Exercises such as single leg deadlifts and lunges can help even them out.It may seem counterintuitive for a explosive, powerful movement such as sprinting, but learning to stay relaxed is key. “The more relaxed you are, the smoother and faster you’ll run,” Usain Bolt once said. “Your muscles get tight when you tense up.” Focus on relaxing your shoulders and not clenching your hands when you run. Johnson had a nifty trick for this: he would rest his thumb gently on his forefinger, which he said gave him the right amount of relaxation and focus.Dreaded by sprinters and endurance runners alike, hill sprints do come in useful.“Running uphill simulates the forward lean of the acceleration phase at the start of a race,” explains personal trainer and sprint coach Geoff Walcott. “Running downhill simulates overspeed running, but the gradient shouldn’t be too steep, for safety reasons.”Coordination and balance are fundamental not only to sprinting, but good running form in general. Walcott encourages exercises such as skipping and using speed ladders to get the feet and body moving faster, which will increase agility and speed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6063b36baccc2074999333a85aee566c8023449e/385_766_4436_2663/master/4436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a59c30b364e1fbc691caa87a0cfd1b67","title":"the specials send us your questions","story":"Picture a ided Britain, buffeted by recession, at a political crossroads.

Lead guitarist Pete Townshend said in a statement that fans could expect “dark ballads, heavy rock stuff, experimental electronica, sampled stuff and Who-ish tunes that began with a guitar that goes yanga-dang”.The group has also teased details of a US orchestral tour. Lead singer Roger Daltrey said of the tour: “Be aware Who fans! That just because it’s the Who with an orchestra, in no way will it compromise the way Pete and I deliver our music. This will be full throttle Who with horns and bells on.”Daltrey, 74, has said it could be his last tour. “I have to be realistic that this is the age I am and voices start to go after a while,” he told the Mirror. “I don’t want to be not as good as I was two years ago.” The group previously suggested that a Las Vegas residency in 2017 would be the start of their “long goodbye”.The pair communicate through their management. Daltrey told the Mirror that Townshend “wanted a year off, so I haven’t spoken to him for a year. That is how we are. He needs that time away.” He added: “It is not music to fuck to. Ours is music to fight to and if it ever loses that fighting edge – which still exists between Pete and I – then I will stop.

Daltrey has said he would like to undertake a similar tour of their second rock opera, 1973’s Quadrophenia. He published a memoir, Thanks a Lot Mr Kibblewhite: My Story, in October.Daltrey said that he is still pursuing a biopic of Moon, a project that has been in the work for three decades, and dismissed rumours that the Who would perform at this year’s 50th anniversary revival of the Woodstock festival.

But the variable nature of wind and solar power means that storing energy until consumers need it has become the next big challenge. And so, large-scale battery installations are springing up across electricity grids around the world, to make them more flexible. In 2017, more than 1GW of energy storage capacity was added around the world – a record, yes, but still a drop in the ocean of global energy demand.Of course, we are not talking about a few AAA batteries here. And yet, all batteries broadly work in a similar manner.Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy when you charge a battery, and then the process is reversed when you draw power from it.There are three main constituents of most batteries: two electrodes and some form of chemical medium called the electrolyte, which can be a liquid, gel or solid. To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode.When you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode.There is around 500MW of large-scale battery capacity installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion.In the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such ancillary services are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online.There are also the beginnings of “hybrid” renewable energy power plants, where batteries are installed alongside solar farms and windfarms. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices.In other parts of the world, such as South Australia, batteries are being used to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage – that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter.Elon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery when he unveiled Tesla’s version three years ago, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid.For solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing.However, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a “virtual power plant”. He describes this as an “Uberisation” of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. “We are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,” he says.We are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Automotive. He views affordability and a decent range between charges as this crop’s defining features.Fisker also views ultrafast charging as vital to helping electric cars go mainstream. While a typical home will take about 8-10 hours to fully top up a car (with a 3KW socket), some new public chargers can do that in about 10 minutes (using a 350KW charger).Electric double-decker buses, built by the Chinese manufacturer BYD, already ply the streets of London. Elon Musk has announced plans for an electric truck.Will we all be flying around in electric jumbo jets soon? “Not yet,” says Shearing, who adds that energy density and weight of batteries meant there would probably only be used in unmanned aerial vehicles in the short term. “I think it’ll be a long time until we see an electric passenger plane,” he says.The lithium in the batteries comes mainly from three big producer countries, Australia, Argentina and Chile, along with emerging producers such as Bolivia, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe. Water consumption and scarcity in some producer countries is the big concern here. “There are definite ethics issues. Large companies are going to be driven by cost,” says Shearer, of cobalt and lithium production.What happens to the batteries towards the end of their life is also a big challenge. Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, of the school of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham, is worried about the fate of batteries when their performance in today’s crop of electric vehicles is no longer good enough for cars. Some now have a second life as a home battery, but he fears the market could be saturated in a few years, undermining the financial case for reuse.“The risk is that there is no viable second-use in the UK and we have a large amount of battery waste, without the processes in place to deal with it,” he says.The bigger and denser the battery, the more chemical energy it can store and therefore the more electricity it can generate. But a bigger, denser battery is more expensive, heavier, takes longer to charge and has more potential for destruction if things go wrong.The chemistry and internal construction of the battery also plays a role in how much energy it can store. Lithium-based batteries are popular because they have a relatively high energy-to-weight ratio and maintain their charge well when not in use.In most devices, battery life is a trade-off between physical size, design, energy density and safety, alongside the energy efficiency of the device it powers.Most batteries can only maintain their full capacity for a finite time and number of charge and discharge cycles. The exact process of battery ageing is still a hot research topic, but there are several mechanisms at play that occur when the battery is used or stored.The most common is the build-up of material on the anode, which slowly gets deposited when the battery is used or stored. A similar oxidation can also occur on the cathode, while the active ingredients of the battery can react and degrade over time. A combination of these effects reduce the amount of lithium ions and active material available for storing electricity, therefore reducing maximum capacity.But the internal resistance of the battery can also increase as it ages, meaning its peak power output is lower, a process that causes issues in iPhones.How a battery is used and stored can dramatically affect its ageing. For instance, batteries can be damaged by exposing them to extremes of temperature, which is more problematic for a car or similar than a smartphone.Rapid cycling of the battery also increases wear, particularly if the power demands on the battery are very high, as is the case with electric cars. Charging and using the battery to its extremes also accelerates ageing, such as charging batteries to their maximum and discharging them to zero.Safety was thrown into the spotlight when some of the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 developed a fault that caused them to short circuit and catch fire.When something disrupts the chemical reaction inside the battery, it can cause “thermal runaway”, where uncontrolled reactions chain together, generating too much heat, typically resulting in batteries bursting or catching fire.Various safety mechanisms, both electrical control circuits and physical measures including shielding and battery structure, mean such events are rare. But they are of particular concern for portable devices, which are often held on a person, and electric vehicles that may be involved in a collision that could damage the integrity of the battery.Companies are working hard to increase the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery, and to bring down the cost of making them.Future prices are unlikely to fall as fast as they have in the past, says Ostermann, because reductions have already been so rapid. Sonnen has seen prices fall from more than €1,000 (£905) per kilowatt hour of capacity when it started in 2010, to about €150-200 per kWh today. But the company expects to cut costs in electronics such as inverters.New wonder materials will take a while to break through, Shearer says. “The next 10 years are going to continue to be lithium-ion dominated. It’s taken a long time to get to this productivity and technological maturity level. For anything to catch up will take a while.”Most innovation will be around lithium-ion, he believes, such as improving the energy density and lowering costs by reducing the amount of cobalt in a battery. The rate at which batteries can take on a charge will also improve, Shearer adds.Radcliffe agrees that lithium-ion will continue to dominate. Cost and performance will improve, driven by the scale-up of manufacturing and continued research, he says.Batteries will also be put to new uses. Fisker says that as technology improves, he expects to see them eventually appear on construction sites, in mines and in industrial equipment, replacing diesel generators. They will be deployed in increasingly small devices, such as medical implants, Shearer says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dc8101c893657c3c14d825f07a3db3fd963b55/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5e7cb08fc0d07ca7c2378769b07e126","title":"china muslim uighur detention camps podcast","story":"Up to a million Muslims are being held in detention camps in the Chinese province of Xinjiang. ’s Lily Kuo visits the region where authorities are expanding the camps and increasing surveillance on ethnic minorities.

Salmond denies the harassment claims.In an official statement issued from his Scottish government email account, Sturgeon’s spokesman said: “This appears to be an attempt to smear the first minister. Suggestions by Mr Salmond’s ‘insiders’ that the first minister knew about the investigation before April 2 are not true.“The suggestion put to Ms Sturgeon’s chief of staff by the Times, that she knew of complaints when she met someone who could be described as an intermediary for Alex Salmond on 6 March, is also not true.”These denials mark a new low in the already fractious relationship between Sturgeon and Salmond, once her close friend and mentor, and brings the schism between the two into the public domain. They have not spoken in nearly six months.The row will also deepen a growing rift within the Scottish National party, which hoped to capitalise on the Conservative government’s disarray over Brexit this week by building up the case for a second Scottish independence referendum. Senior SNP figures say privately that strategy has been comprehensively undermined by the feud between the pair.Several SNP MPs, including Angus MacNeil, the MP for the Western Isles, and Joanna Cherry, are seen as supporters of Salmond’s case, alleging he has been unfairly traduced by Sturgeon’s government, as are many SNP activists.The latest allegations from Salmond’s camp could be seen as a deliberate attempt to undermine Sturgeon’s credibility after she referred herself on Sunday to an independent panel that polices the ministerial code in Scotland.The claims could be seen to bolster allegations from opposition parties that Sturgeon breached the ministerial code by failing to immediately notify the civil service she had discussions about government business, and had failed to record the content of those discussions.The Conservatives and Labour reject Sturgeon’s insistence the meetings were SNP-related, because they were explicitly arranged at Salmond’s request to discuss a Scottish government investigation. Sturgeon’s officials have refused to confirm or deny that Salmond asked her to intervene.Sturgeon acknowledged on Thursday she delayed telling Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s chief civil servant, about her meeting on 2 April or a subsequent phone call with Salmond on 28 April until 6 June, the day before she had a second private meeting with Salmond.The first minister has repeatedly rejected complaints, raised privately by SNP MPs and publicly former SNP ministers, that the harassment inquiry should not have opened. Sturgeon insists sexual harassment claims need to be investigated without fear or favour, regardless of the status of the accused person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02d66033ec91b08037359a7e138d74e61e831c5/0_119_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb9cd17901208b48ce275f4ad6124fd","title":"theresa may claim that all parties accepted welsh devolution questioned","story":"Theresa May herself did not back bill after narrow win for devolution in referendumA key section of Theresa May’s final plea for MPs to support her Brexit deal was changed at the last minute after it emerged that a historical comparison she planned to make – that all parties backed the creation of the Welsh assembly after a narrow referendum result – was not true.In the original version of the speech given at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent before Tuesday’s Brexit vote in the Commons, the prime minister was due to say that the result of the narrowly won 1997 referendum to create a Welsh assembly was “accepted by both sides” and that the legitimacy of the vote was never questioned.But when the relevant bill was put to the Commons after the Welsh referendum, many Tory MPs, including the then newly elected May, voted against it.More uncomfortable still for May’s arguments against a second EU referendum, the Conservatives went into the 2005 general election with a manifesto pledging a new vote for the people on Wales, to include an option to abolish the assembly.The emergence of the contradiction led to changes to parts of May’s speech on Monday, in which the prime minister urged MPs to back her deal and warned that if it was rejected Brexit might not happen.“On the rare occasions when parliament puts a question to the British people directly, we have always understood that their response carries a profound significance,” she said.However, after journalists and academics questioned the veracity of this account, this paragraph was changed, removing the suggestion that the referendum result was accepted without question.Parliamentary records show that in December 1999, May was among a large number of Conservative MPs who voted against the second reading of the government of Wales bill, as did Brexiters who strongly back the 2016 referendum result such as John Redwood and Owen Paterson.The 2005 Conservative manifesto, under which May stood for re-election, with Michael Howard as party leader, stated: “In Wales we will work with the assembly and give the Welsh people a referendum on whether to keep the assembly in its current form, increase its powers or abolish it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091388f5240e12fc54dcde5be6bbd5419c785554/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f7b19a8f1db7912f7dbf9810e542f66","title":"theresa may refuses to rule out brexit article 50 extension","story":"PM says she does not believe UK should delay leaving EU, but does not say it never wouldTheresa May has declined to categorically rule out an extension to article 50 on the eve of the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, saying she wanted to deliver a “smooth and orderly Brexit”.Speaking in Stoke-on-Trent as she announced an exchange of letters between the UK and the EU giving assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop arrangements, May said she did not believe the UK should delay leaving the EU but did not say she would never accept such a delay. reported on Sunday that EU officials were laying the groundwork for an extension to article 50 until July this year, to allow all the necessary legislation to pass.May suggested that would not be desirable but also stressed the need for an orderly exit. “We’re leaving on 29 March. I’ve been clear I don’t believe we should be extending article 50 and I don’t believe we should be having a second referendum,” May said.“We have an instruction from the British people to leave and it’s our duty to deliver on that but I want to do it in a way that is smooth and orderly and protects jobs and security.”In the speech at Portmeirion pottery in the heart of the leave-voting city, May also warned MPs of the consequences of being seen to defy the referendum result.“The deal honours the vote in the referendum by translating the people’s instruction into a detailed and practical plan for a better future,” she said.“No one else has put forward an alternative which does this … With no deal we would have: no implementation period, no security co-operation, no guarantees for UK citizens overseas, no certainty for businesses and workers here in Stoke and across the UK, and changes to everyday life in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our union at risk.“And with no Brexit ... we would risk a subversion of the democratic process.”The speech was overshadowed on Monday morning by an embarrassing gaffe in the key section of her final plea to MPs, which said MPs had always respected the vote in previous referendums including those where there was a much narrower margin, such as the creation of the Welsh assembly.In fact, the creation of the assembly after the 1997 referendum was opposed by the Conservative party including May, who voted against it in the House of Commons. The 2005 Conservative manifesto also promised a rerun of that referendum with the aim of abolishing the assembly.In remarks briefed overnight, May said the result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution had never seriously been questioned.The wording was changed in the speech delivered in Stoke. May said that the “result was accepted by parliament”.May will return to Westminster to give a statement to the Commons before the debate on her deal resumes. EU officials earlier warned that a letter of assurances from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk on the Irish backstop, due to be unveiled on Monday in the Commons, contained nothing new.The prime minister had promised she would secure additional “legal and political assurances” from Brussels when she delayed a vote on her deal in December.However, the joint letter will only emphasise that the backstop is a fallback option and spell out in detail the efforts that the commission will make to advance the trade talks. It will not offer a firm date for the conclusion of the backstop arrangements.May is also set to lay out the government’s own intended date by which the UK will have finalised a trade deal with the EU.In the 2017 general election, Stoke-on-Trent South was of one of the few notable Conservative victories over Labour.“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,” she said.“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote? People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3137faed4ccbcaa6252b1bc63acdfb659b1af9a1/0_210_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5458fb4aad9b87437f3839eb38dc359e","title":"theresa mays brexit deal unlikely to pass says liam fox","story":"Minister urges MPs to back deal because blocking Brexit would be ‘political disaster’Theresa May is unlikely to have her Brexit deal passed on Tuesday, a senior member of her cabinet has admitted, as EU officials warned that a letter of assurances on the Irish backstop due to be unveiled on Monday contains nothing new.In a statement to the Commons on Monday afternoon, the prime minister will try to win round MPs to her deal by publishing correspondence with the EU’s most senior officials.The prime minister had promised she would secure additional “legal and political assurances” from Brussels when she delayed a vote on her deal and fought off a challenge to her leadership.In a joint letter, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, presidents of the European commission and European council, are understood to emphasise that the backstop is a fallback option that they do not intend to trigger.The customs union envisaged in the backstop, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, would only be a temporary solution, and the EU would do its utmost to make swift progress on alternatives, they are expected to add.The efforts that the commission will make to advance the trade talks will be spelled out in detail.But EU officials have admitted that the letter will fall short of offering a date by when the backstop arrangements will be lifted, and fear that the prime minister has put too much faith in the last-minute gambit.The British government will also publish a letter of intent when May stands up in the Commons. It is likely to lay out the dates by when the UK will seek to have a trade deal finalised, making the backstop irrelevant.Juncker said on Friday, while in Bucharest for the opening of the Romanian presidency of the EU, that he would not offer anything that could be “confused with a renegotiation”.In an admission of the weakness of the prime minister’s position before her Commons statement at 3.30pm, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, conceded on Monday that while it was not impossible for the government to win the vote, it was nevertheless unlikely.Fox also went on the attack to claim that parliament was “dominated by politicians that wish to remain in the European union” adding that “this is the basis of the problem we have”.Fox called on MPs to show “humility” and “honour and respect” the referendum result. He added that blocking Brexit would “shake to its foundations the relationship between parliament and the voters of the country”.A no-deal Brexit was “survivable”, he said, and those affected by it would adapt over time to the disruption. He echoed the recent claims of the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, by saying that a “no Brexit” would see a rise of “the populism we have seen in continental Europe”.“I don’t regard no-deal as national suicide. This is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think no-deal would damage our economy – I’ve been frank about that – but I think it’s survivable. I think no Brexit, politically, is a disaster from which we might not recover.”May would outline to MPs “the assurances she had had from the European Union following discussions over the last few days”, Fox added.If May is defeated she is likely to face a no-confidence vote tabled by Labour. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, declined to say precisely when this would happen, but indicated it would be soon. “The call will be made tomorrow after that vote,” he told Today.With May and her ministers refusing to outline what alternative plan might be put forward if her proposal was defeated, a series of backbench ideas have been unveiled to seize control of the process from government.Om Monday, a cross-party group of MPs from the Lib Dems, Labour, Conservatives and SNP were publishing two draft bills designed to pave the way for a new referendum. One of these would give voters the option of voting for the government’s deal or staying in the EU.Separately, three senior Conservative backbenchers drafted a bill that would give the liaison committee, which groups together the MPs who chair various select committees, a key role in coming up with a new plan.Nick Boles, who has come up with the idea along with Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, said all three would vote for the PM’s deal on Tuesday, but would act if it failed.Boles told Today their planned bill would give May a further three weeks to come up with a compromise deal and get it through parliament. If that failed the liaison committee would be given “the responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal”.He added: “If the house passed that compromise deal, then the government would be legally required to implement whatever it was that they had.”Boles is among Tory backbenchers accused by some newspapers of trying to stage a “coup”. Asked about this, Boles said: “It’s a funny kind of coup which requires a majority vote of democratically elected MPs before the task starts rolling. So, no, it isn’t a coup, it’s an expression of parliamentary will.”Similar accusations have also been levelled against the Tory former attorney general Dominic Grieve, one of the MPs tabling the proposed bill on a new referendum. At the weekend, some newspapers said he was leading a coup against Brexit in alliance with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow.Grieve, whose amendment obliging May to respond to the defeat of her plan within three days was passed by MPs last week, told the  the reports were “rubbish”, and had resulted in him receiving death threats.“I can emphatically say it is totally untrue that I am in a conspiracy with the Speaker either to stop Brexit or to change the standing orders of the house,” he said.In her speech, at a factory in Stoke-on-Trent, where more than two-thirds of people voted to leave the EU, May will reiterate her claim that a rejection of her proposals on Tuesday would destroy faith in politics, and could mean that Brexit does not happen.“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy,” she is due to say.“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote? People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca6547c1c6c3d7fe83b9fa7671797c68d1dda8e/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96ba49a896fb73c0632cd431adfb1ab8","title":"uk jobs boom strongest in south yorkshire and merseyside thinktank finds","story":"South Yorkshire and Merseyside recorded the strongest levels of jobs growth in the decade since the financial crisis, according to a report that also finds low-income households have benefited more than richer ones.Dan Jarvis, the Labour mayor of the Sheffield city region, said: “Investment to attract global manufacturers like Boeing and McLaren Automotive to the region is paying off.”Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor of the Liverpool city region, said the jobs recovery had been kickstarted by Liverpool’s European capital of culture year in 2008, adding: “Our challenge as a combined authority is to build on that success, despite government austerity and the uncertainty of Brexit.”Despite the gains in major urban areas blighted by deindustrialisation under Margaret Thatcher, rural areas and second-tier towns have failed to keep pace, in a reflection of the growing ide between metropolitan Britain and the rest of the country. Yorkshire, excluding its biggest cities, recorded a decline in its employment rate of 0.6 percentage points.About 2.7m jobs have been created since the financial crisis, outstripping many major European economies where unemployment rates remain high.However, questions have been raised over the type of work, with the growth in precarious employment on zero-hours contracts and in the gig economy. While the Resolution Foundation found that growing numbers of low-income households and disadvantaged groups had been helped into work, it warned that job insecurity had risen, in particular for younger workers.There are still 780,000 workers in Britain without the guarantee of fixed hours, a further 950,000 agency workers, while one in seven worker are self-employed. All these more precarious working roles are significantly above pre-crisis levels.Average wages remain around £25 below the peak recorded before the financial crisis, following a “lost decade” of pay growth for British workers.Almost two-thirds of the jobs growth since 2008 has gone to those on the bottom-half of the pay ladder, while workers with low qualifications account for almost half of the growth in employment.Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While the jobs surge has not been as dominated by London or low-paid work as some claim, new challenges have developed – particularly for younger workers and with a big rise in insecure work.“While more people are working, as a country we are still earning less each week for doing so than we were 10 years ago.”Alok Sharma, the employment minister, said: “All this is very good news but we are not complacent and are taking further action to increase employment rates for under-represented groups by developing innovative support programmes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd34874d69447a1d9525cd43af5155fa7b6e200c/309_263_1593_956/master/1593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3b9048c952e266c32cf6c34a7be22d3","title":"can you solve it catrionas colourful conundrums","story":"Today’s puzzles come from Catriona Shearer, a maths teacher at a school in north Essex, whose colourful geometry puzzles have recently gained a following on social media.

Now a new guide to portion sizes warning that people are eating too much without realising has been launched by nutritionists, to suggest how much food people should eat during the day to stay healthy and help combat the obesity crisis.The British Nutrition Foundation’s (BNF) guide is designed, it says, to complement the government advice on the sorts of foods to eat, as laid out in the Eatwell Guide. It spells out how much of each sort of food – starchy carbohydrates, protein, dairy, fruit and vegetables and oils and spreads – constitute a healthy diet within the 2,000 calories a day that women need and 2,500 for men.Super-sizing is clearly out but portion sizes are a puzzle to many. While an apple or a banana is a portion in itself, the right amount of pasta or rice to cook in the interests of staying a healthy weight is more difficult to assess. Recipes vary and many people take a guess and throw more into the saucepan if they feel particularly hungry. The BNF, in its new guide, says the answer is 65g to 75g dry weight (180g when cooked) – or about the amount that would fit in two cupped hands.The guide offers spoon and hand measurements, which may be easier in daily life than continually getting out the scales. The suggested single portion of a grilled chicken breast, a cooked salmon fillet or a cooked steak is “about half the size of your hand”. This acknowledges that bigger adults, with bigger hands, will need larger portions. Cheddar cheese should be no more than “about the size of two thumbs together” and a baked potato “about the size of your fist”.The government’s Eatwell Guide, says our diet should be made up of one-third fruit and vegetables, one-third starchy carbohydrates and the rest ided between dairy and protein. That means, says the BNF, we can eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables, three to four of starchy carbohydrates such as potatoes, bread, rice and pasta (which in line with research this week should be wholegrain), and two to three portions each of protein foods and of dairy or alternatives and stay healthy without overdoing the calories.We do not think much about portion sizes, says Bridget Benelam, a nutrition scientist with the BNF. “The amount we put on our plate typically depends on the portion size we are used to consuming, how hungry we feel and how much is offered as a helping at a restaurant table or in a packet or ready meal.”The guide says an easy way to measure spaghetti is to use your thumb and index finger to hold a bunch the size of a pound coin.It suggests smaller portion measures for snacks, such as 20g of unsalted nuts and seeds or the amount that fits into the palm of the hand, which will be between 113 and 137 calories. Also snack size is 55g of reduced-fat hummus – about two tablespoons, four cooked cocktail sausages or two falafel (40g and 113 calories).A portion of fruit or vegetables – of which we should eat at least five a day – could be two plums, two satsumas, seven strawberries, three heaped serving spoons of peas or carrots, one medium tomato or three sticks of celery.If you do include treats, says the guide, they should be small, at around 100 to 150 calories, and not too frequent. Their examples include a small chocolate biscuit bar, a small multipack bag of crisps, four small squares of chocolate (20g) or a mini muffin.The guidance was produced with help from a panel of experts, says the BNF, and funding from major food companies and supermarkets including Waitrose, Tesco and Marks and Spencer.• A recommended day includes a breakfast of two wheat biscuits with semi-skimmed milk, followed by a banana and small 150ml glass of orange juice. Lunch is a baked potato about the size of your fist, with tuna mayonnaise made with a medium-sized tin of tuna. A cereal bowl full of mixed salad can also be eaten as part of your midday meal, as well as two tangerines. Dinner is spaghetti bolognese served with the amount of cooked pasta that would fit in two hands cupped together, and three serving spoons or more of broccoli. Dessert can be a small pot of low fat fruit yoghurt. Throughout the day people are advised to snack on fruit, such as an apple, as well as two oatcakes and reduced fat soft cheese. This meal plan equates to seven portions of fruit and vegetables, four portions of starchy foods, two portions of protein and three portions of dairy.• A recommended spaghetti bolognese recipe involves 75g of uncooked spaghetti per person. Advice states that you can measure a portion for one by using your finger and thumb to make a hole the size of a £1 coin. However, the amount of pasta needed may go up if you’re cooking for someone with higher calorie needs. The portion size of raw mince advised is about 125g but this can be halved in a dish with other ingredients or meat can be replaced with pulses and other vegetarian options. It’s recommended that a lot of vegetables are added to the bolognese sauce, such as onions, tomatoes and celery.• Another recommended recipe is fish pie, with guidance suggesting about 180g of mashed potato per person (about three average sized potatoes) and around 120-200g of raw fish per person. It’s also advise to add vegetables such as frozen peas or spinach. All dishes should be served with plenty of cooked vegetables or salad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad806ae3f0dee2bf55db8817cf1a99861aa2939a/0_115_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af448053a6e2da22af14e928ff452392","title":"eliud kipchoge mo farah london marathon","story":"The world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge says he is “relishing the prospect” of facing Mo Farah again over 26.2 miles after confirming that he will run the London Marathon in April.Kipchoge, who won his third London title in last year’s race, with Farah finishing third, then went on to set a stunning world record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds in Berlin in September – beating the previous best by over a minute.Farah, meanwhile, went on to claim the Chicago Marathon in October in a European record time of 2hr 5min 11sec – and afterwards promised that he was “not afraid to keep turning up in the same field and testing Kipchoge”.That wish has now been granted with the Kenyan, who was named the 2018 IAAF Athlete of the Year in December, having agreed to make his fourth appearance in London.“I had a memorable 2018, winning the Virgin Money London Marathon and then setting a new world record at the Berlin marathon and I’m hoping that 2019 is just as good to me,”said Kipchoge.“I am looking forward to racing Sir Mo Farah again. He is a great champion and proved in Chicago that he can win a major marathon so I relish the battle with him and also the many other great athletes that I’m sure will once again be on the start line in London.”The top three from the 2018 podium will all be in London again this year with organisers confirming that Ethiopia’s 22-year-old marathon star Shura Kitata, who was second to Kipchoge last year before finishing runner-up in the New York marathon in November, will race.Hugh Brasher, event director of the race, said he was delighted to have set up a mouthwatering showdown between Kipchoge, who is unbeaten in London and also holds the course record of 2:03.05, and Britain’s greatest distance runner.“There is no doubt that Eliud Kipchoge is the greatest marathon runner of all time,” he said “Since Sir Mo Farah won the Chicago Marathon in October, everyone has been talking about another head-to-head between Mo and Eliud and we are absolutely thrilled that this showdown will happen.“We will see two absolute legends of distance running competing over 26.2 miles of roads in the greatest marathon in the world.

She saw a beautiful woman – neither white nor black – floating above the floor in a flowing seamless dress, with a veil that covered her hair. She wore no shoes, just like Alphonsine and her classmates.“Who are you?” Alphonsine asked. “I am the mother of the word,” replied the woman, whom Alphonsine immediately recognised as the Virgin Mary. Then she issued a terrible warning: Rwanda was going to become a hell on Earth in a conflict that would see the picturesque rivers of Kibeho village run red with blood.It was 28 November 1981, and when Alphonsine reported what she had seen, her friends ridiculed her, her teachers scolded her and her village shunned her. But then another two students, Anathalie and Marie Claire – the three became known as “the Trinity” – insisted they too had been visited by the Virgin Mary and given the same apocalyptic warning.Kibeho is a small parish nestled in Mubuga, the “land of the seven hills” in eastern Rwanda. It is the most famine-prone region of one of the world’s poorest countries, but so beautiful that locals say: “God comes on holiday here.”Of course we now know that, a decade after the Trinity’s terrible visions, Rwanda was riven by a terrible genocide. During 100 days in 1994, up to a million of Rwanda’s population of just over seven million were murdered by the ruling Hutu government in an attempt to exterminate the Tutsi tribe.Thousands of people were slaughtered in their churches, their decapitated bodies dumped into rivers. Colleagues, neighbours, friends and even family members slaughtered one another. Kibeho itself suffered two massacres. Thousands of citizens were brutally killed in the parish church and, a year later, on the esplanade where the apparitions had taken place. Most of the college’s students were murdered.In 2001, after a 20-year investigation by the Vatican – and seven years after the genocide – the pope certified the apparitions as authentic. Tens of thousands of pilgrims now travel to Kibeho each year in search of benediction.The extraordinary story of these three schoolgirls inspired my friend, the American playwright Katori Hall, to write Our Lady of Kibeho. I first worked with Katori in New York in 2006. Katori’s background as a journalist and an actor bring a rare sensibility to her plays, which combine a reporter’s eye for a good story and historical detail together with an understanding of how to craft characters that only an actor can experience. Back in London, I staged the world premiere of her play The Mountaintop, about the life and death of Martin Luther King, which went on to become the surprise winner of the best play award at the 2010 Oliviers and is now one of the most produced new plays in the US.For Katori, Kibeho College symbolised the defining role the Catholic church has played in Rwanda’s education system and political life over the last century, including shaping its ideological isions. It was the church that had helped implement the disastrous “racial” nationwide census, distinguishing Hutu from Tutsi in every neighbourhood.Alone in their community, Alphonsine, Anathalie and Marie Claire understood the lessons that scripture offered against the growing hatred of their times. Young and powerless, their warnings went unheeded. Survivors of the tragedy describe burning churches, streets clotted with corpses, starving livestock, mass graves, lost orphans and famine and disease everywhere – the very things described by the three girls when recounting their terrible visions.Fergal Keane, a BBC correspondent in Rwanda in 1994, found it difficult to capture the horror of what happened. “In writing about Rwanda, I am conscious that my words will always be unequal to the task … What I encountered was evil in a form that rendered me inarticulate.”Most historical accounts of the genocide focus on either society or the state, the former exploring the longstanding racism in Rwandan society and the latter documenting the complex power struggles in government and the ways in which propaganda radiated from the capital to the provinces and inspired the violence. While Katori’s play touches on the political, economic and social, it is more interested in how religion can influence the personal and political behaviour of a nation.What makes Katori’s play so moving is that it takes place at a time before the genocide, when there is still space for optimism in the lives of the schoolchildren it depicts.Some of those children who survived have helped Katori in researching her play. They have noted that the power of Our Lady of Kibeho lies in its ability to stay true to the perspectives of Alphonsine, Anathalie and Marie Claire. Despite rumblings of the growing ide between Hutus and Tutsis, we lose ourselves in this story of these three young women who want to change the world they will inherit.Whether the visions that they described were real or not, the schoolgirls’ testimony highlighted the daily injustices that they saw around them. Theirs was a protest against the moral, social and political decay of their community – a reminder that sometimes young people can sense tragedy ahead in a way that adults are incapable of.In turbulent times when the voices of young people are so often ignored, Katori and I hope that the UK premiere of this extraordinary play will spark a conversation on ways to heal our own political, racial and religious ides.On a summer morning in 2003, many of those who had participated in the genocidal killings walked out of prison into the sunshine, singing hymns, their freedom granted by the president. Survivors watched as those who had killed their families and friends returned to their villages, reoccupying homes that had been empty for almost a decade. Today, Rwandans continue to confront on a daily basis the pain of memory, the power of reconciliation, the challenges of redemption and forgiveness and the ineradicability of loss. Two words hover over the nation’s collective psychology: never again.• Our Lady of Kibeho is at the Royal and Derngate, Northampton, until 2 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fb4261b986b777c3bbd21cf2496fae6bc7ffd1/0_1674_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65dac81020f01ef53cc8ea10440d43c3","title":"10 best meditation mindfulness retreats holidays uk europe","story":"We pick mindfulness and meditation holidays in beautiful surroundings – many combined with other activities like walking, singing and tai chiMore retreat top 10s: yoga | creative | by readersIn the Dart valley near Totnes, the Sharpham Trust meditation centre offers mindfulness retreats of different lengths throughout the year, including walking and singing breaks.

The Henley Passport Index ranks countries according to the number of destinations passport holders can visit without a pre-arranged visa, which decreased for the UK this year.In 2015, the UK was ranked joint-first, alongside the US, but has dropped down the listings each year since. The number of visa-freevisa-on-arrival countries UK passport holders can travel to fell from 186 to 185 last year, due to the introduction of e-visas in Turkey (now required prior to arrival). Despite this, however, the UK’s score has improved overall since the index began in 2006, when it had 126, and there are now more outbound trips from the UK than ever before with 72.8 million in 2017.The impact of Brexit on passports and visas is still hanging in the balance. However, in the event of a no-deal scenario, the European commission has confirmed that UK citizens would have to pay €7 for a travel permit at least 72 hours before travel, a similar system to the US Esta visa-waiver.Japan’s passport is ranked the strongest in the world for the second year running, allowing visa-free access to 190 countries to an estimated 17.5 million outbound Japanese travellers last year.The index uses data from the International Air Transport Association, and includes passports from 199 countries checked against 227 possible travel destinations.Asian countries dominate the index’s top spots, with Singapore and South Korea ranked second, with access to 189 destinations visa-free or visa-on-arrival. China has also jumped 16 places in the past two years, from 85th in 2017 to 69th in 2019.European countries still fare well, with Germany and France ranked third, with 188 and Denmark, Finland, Italy and Sweden fourth, with 187.The past decade has seen a marked decline in many African countries’ rankings, including Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Gambia and South Africa, which have all dropped at least 18 places since 2009. Afghanistan and Iraq hold joint-last place for the third year in a row, with a current visa-freevisa-on-arrival score of 30.Despite a rising isolationist sentiment in some regions, global mobility is improving, with an increase in visa-free access and mutually beneficial agreements overall. Historical data from the index shows that in 2006, an average passport holder could travel to 58 destinations without needing a visa by the end of 2018 this number had almost doubled to 107.“The general spread of open-door policies has the potential to contribute billions to the global economy, as well as create significant employment opportunities around the world,” said Christian H Kälin, chairman of Henley \u0026amp Partners and index founder. “South Korea and the United Arab Emirates’ recent ascent in the rankings are further examples of what happens when countries take a proactive foreign affairs approach, an attitude which significantly benefits their citizens as well as the international community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b2363a6ae170b192a5df2a7cb6e8447b4a760b/209_819_5821_3493/master/5821.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b557f2d87696ec145cb52f48b8d8e18","title":"chumbawamba alice nutter trust tv","story":"She spent two decades in the anarchist band who drenched John Prescott at the Brits. Now she’s writing big-budget shows starring Hillary SwankThe scruffy camper van in the drive looks promising. Apart from that though, there’s little to suggest that this handsome former vicarage on a sleepy cul-de-sac in a working-class area of Leeds is home to an anarchist. One who once, along with some of her bandmates, very publicly poured a bucket of icy water over the deputy prime minister’s head. There’s even a festive wreath hanging on the front door – that’s practically bourgeois isn’t it?To be honest I’ve been doubting Alice Nutter’s continued anarcho-punk credentials since speaking to her on the phone, when she tipped me off that for an extra £20 I could upgrade to first class on the train. First class?! What, so I can attack the enemy from the inside? No, because it’s easier to get some work done …“Everyone thinks that somehow we’d be preserved in aspic, you know, like aged anarchists,” she says after letting me in. “I think everybody should have the right to first class, I don’t think some people should have it and some people shouldn’t. I think everybody should have the right to what’s good in life – I’m not embarrassed about that.”Alice Nutter offers me a latte. A FRIGGING LATTE! (He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a latte drink.) Her 19-year-old daughter, Mae, comes into the kitchen to make toast. She knows “embarrassingly little” about Chumbawamba, or Tubthumping. “I’ve always known mum as a writer,” she says. Because that’s what Alice Nutter is now. A writer of plays, and a TV screenwriter, most recently on Trust, the entertaining drama series about the kidnapping of Jean Paul Getty III.Alice always knew she was going to be a writer, ever since a teacher told her mum and dad that their daughter had an extraordinary command of the English language. But Nutter (or Anne Holden as she was before she punked herself up by deed poll, taking the name of a woman who was hanged in 1612 for witchcraft) didn’t get off to the brightest of starts. Born to a working-class family in Burnley, she had a bad relationship with her dad, got involved with drugs and left school with only a couple of O levels. Fortunately, she started hanging around with a more aspirational group of kids and that basically saved her. Together they became Chumbawamba. (I get knocked down, but I get up again.)Alice, now 57, was with the band for 22 of their 30 years in existence, singing, playing percussion, jumping around. “I’m not particularly musical,” she admits. “I’m a good dancer and I’m theatrical, I could get away with it.”For 20 years they lived in a squat in Leeds, sharing (very little) money, and ideas, becoming vegans (long before everyone became a vegan), getting involved with political causes – South Africa, Northern Ireland, the miners’ strike. More than anything, they were friends. Still are.Were they anarchists? “I don’t think it matters what you call yourself. What you need to do is align yourself with what’s most useful for change.” She says inequality was their main beef: “You can bring everything down to inequality and injustice. And it can be about class, or race, or whatever. At the time we were really anti-parliamentary because we thought they were all the same.”These days Alice knocks on doors for the Labour party, for Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. “Promoting co-ops and cooperation, saying they’ll pledge £100m a year to help the homeless, I’ll knock on doors for that,” she says. “I was lucky, I came up through the postwar settlement, I screwed my education up, but I had those opportunities.”She feels that working-class kids today don’t have the chances she had. “I’d never be where I am today without the dole. That paid for me to have a creative life.”She describes herself as “a sort of communist-Marxist. Not a party political Communist, but in the sense of all things in common for people and the idea of sharing. I know I’ve got a lot but I’m totally willing to have less.” There’s a bust of Karl Marx on the mantelpiece, along with one of James Dean. We’ve moved into the cosy living room, with a wood-burner, a Christmas tree and biscuits.Chumbawamba’s big hit, Tubthumping, an anthem of defiance for the ordinary and the oppressed, came out in 1997. It didn’t win anything at the Brit awards ceremony, but that was where John Prescott got his soaking. Chumbawamba were angry about the government’s failure to resolve the Liverpool dockers’ strike. (They were not fans of New Labour or Blair.) They were also drunk, and disappointed – not so much about their own failure to win but about the fact that winning would have given a platform to the sacked scouse docker they’d brought along.Tubthumping also, for the first time, provided Chumbawamba with a bit of money. Ironic perhaps, but equally shared. Alice left the band in 2004, because “if you’re jumping about in your mid-40s, you look fucking stupid”. And because she knew she wasn’t really a musician, she was a writer. “I’d been planning it, in my head, all my life.”At the age of 28, while in Chumbawamba, Alice took an English A level. Plus she’d written short stories, a play for a Bradford anarchist group, and – with the band – a pantomime for the kids of striking miners in south Wales. “We didn’t know owt about theatre, we were making it up as we went along. We’d heard of Brecht, didn’t know fucking anything about it. I’d only been to the theatre twice before I started writing for it. I saw Hamlet and I thought, I can do that.”It wasn’t as easy as that. She soon realised that though she might have the right muscles she didn’t have the craft, and sitting at home trying wasn’t working. There needed to be a plan, focus. It was going to take time and a lot of graft. She started a screenwriting MA but quit when she began to feel it was more about getting a qualification than learning to write.Then she got on a so-you-want-to-be-a-writer course at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, which meant cancelling a holiday. That led to the offer of a three-week run in the Playhouse courtyard of her play Foxes, about a group of asylum seekers in Leeds. “I had a budget for a ladder and bucket, but there were actors, and I was so unbelievably thrilled.”Then came another course, this time with Jimmy McGovern, after which he asked if she would like to pitch to write an episode of The Street. She got it, and would have written more episodes if breast cancer had not got in the way. “A hiccup,” she says.Through another project she met Simon Beaufoy (“Boofoo, Bow Fort, Bow Fowey … I still can’t say his name), who wrote The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire. He wasn’t immediately overjoyed by his writing partner for this project, which was about undercover cops. “He said to them, ‘Whatever you do, don’t get an activist, get a writer,’” says Nutter. “And they got me, and he said, ‘They got a fucking activist.’ But then I handed the script in and he realised I was a writer.”That one didn’t work out, but the pair realised they saw eye to eye. So when he created Trust, the big-budget TV series for FX directed by Danny Boyle (Oh Danny Boyle, Danny Boyle, Danny Boyle) among others, he hired Nutter – first to write one episode, then another, then to be involved in the whole thing.Trust rigorously explores money, family and power structures. And not just regarding the dysfunctional Gettys, but also the Italian kidnappers. Is the subject matter, the super rich, surprising for a Tubthumping anarchist to be involved with? No, she says, because it’s full of political themes. “And if you look at really rich people, there’s a socialism in the rich, they share everything with each other. It’s just no one else gets it.”It was also the most fun Nutter has ever had at work. “I just kept thinking: I can’t believe my luck.” Now she’s working on another series with Beaufoy – about happiness, artificial intelligence and algorithms.It’s time for photos. Where does the photographer want her? Somewhere that looks bourgeois, like the flash kitchen, I suggest. “You’re obsessed,” she says. She would give me a lift to the station, but her car has a puncture. Is there an Uber service in Leeds, I wonder? Yes, but she doesn’t use them, on principle. “Once they’ve got the prices down they drive everyone else out.” She calls a local cab company instead. Credentials, credibility, dignity – all remain intact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612122430ed0fb62565fabff08a5ee8a52e09598/0_77_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a113dfce386a00190acee6879268155","title":"alaska houseless lifestyle outdoors hunting","story":"Homeless implies a moral failure while being houseless – lacking a permanent three-dimensional structure – is less stress on the planet and on my brainI am a 64-year-old navy veteran of the Vietnam era and houseless in the tundra, somewhere around 65 degrees north latitude. I have been scrambling around these parts since 2013, inhabiting a variety of iterations, from riverbank tent camps to cabins, buses and RVs and occasionally at fancy lodges when I have worked caretaking gigs. I live like this in protest of our consumer society. I find it more fulfilling, more authentic, less stress – on the planet and on my brain.Feckless? Maybe. Shiftless? Probably. Irresponsible? Absolutely! But homeless? I beg to differ. Homeless implies an inidual moral failure, which may indeed aptly describe one part of my character. Houseless is simply lacking a permanent three-dimensional structure.If you have a place to gather your thoughts and lay your head at the end of the day, how is that not a home? My accommodations are substandard if a house is used as a metric. But my tent keeps me and my bedroll out of most elements in the spring, summer and as far into the fall as I can take it. I find sturdier shelter when the water I soak my false teeth in overnight freezes and I have to chisel them free before I can eat breakfast. Right now, I have a bus with a wood-burning stove in it on loan for the winter, so I’m out of the elements until spring.This ain’t no city slickin’, shopping cart, panhandling kind of houseless. No dumpsters to dine at, no citizens to hassle for donations, no cops to dodge when you need to pee. Most days I see more wildlife than humans. I spend more time traversing dirt than pavement, more paths and game trails than roads and sidewalks. I hear more of nature’s notes than the white noise of civilization, and I can pretty much pee anywhere.If you’re not a moron, community members are not averse to doing you favors, giving you rides or putting you to work – labor can be a barter commodity. And most of these hillbillies are packing heat anyway, so it would behoove one not to be too stupid.In general, stupidity out here in the frozen north usually carries severe consequences: campfires in a dry forest on a windy day easily get out of control sloppy chainsaw, axe or knife work you could lose a finger or cut into an artery and bleed out carelessness near rivers or ice could drown you drinking water from a polluted creek will leave you very sick. Pick berries to eat oblivious to your surroundings and you could get eaten yourself (bears like berries too).People with a penchant for stumbling around drunk and stoned and sleeping it off curbside in the middle of the afternoon probably won’t succeed out here. Discoveries of frozen houseless people regularly make local news headlines. If these folks can’t make in an urban setting with services right around the corner, living in the woods miles from any help is not an option.I’m vague about my location. I don’t want a flock of freakin’ hobos descending on the area like an invasive species only to discover, when the weather gets real, they weren’t prepared and start dropping like the flies do on cold autumn evenings.Hunting and gathering play a large role in the procurement of sustenance at my location. The activities reduce the degree of reliance on injected, processed, wrapped-in-plastic, crammed-into-coolers, industrialized food. We have meat on the hoof out here and I have no qualms about harvesting the resource sustainably. Plus, it’s organic. This ain’t a trophy hunt, this is food!I do still have to rely on some factory food. On my monthly ride on public transportation to the local food bank 30 miles away, I’ll pick up rice, pasta, cereal and milk, some canned goods, fruit, veggies, maybe some soup plus peanut butter and welfare cheese (I hate how much I love that stuff!). I get fruit juice, too. If I add sugar and yeast to the juice it will ferment into a fairly stout libation in a matter of weeks.All in all, though, I prefer a campfire-roasted porcupine that I killed and butchered (recently, one who had smacked my dog with his tail, embedding 15 quills in the mutt’s snout), slathered with highbush cranberry ketchup, foraged chickweed salad with mushrooms on the side, a hot cup of stinging nettle tea to wash it down and a handful of wild blueberries for dessert.Bugs, sticks, sand and assorted forest floor debris sometimes makes it into my vittles but, as the family I encountered in my travels through Canada some years back said when I pointed out that their kid was eating dirt: “It’s clean dirt.” And the bugs are protein! Anyway, I get to devour the feast creekside watching fish sex. No, it’s not the latest Netflix series, it’s actual salmon spawning in the water 10ft from my tent.My living room floor gets a fresh gold carpet when fall colors take over and the tree branches go bare. Daylight starts fading fast closing in on the autumnal equinox and stays in decline till winter solstice, bottoming out at around five and a half hours here. So, I use rechargeable LEDs (a gift from a friend) to read and write by and a headlamp for more active endeavors like ice fishing or splitting firewood.My toilet is a hollow cottonwood stump and I bathe with a kettle of hot creek water. Some places along the highway offer showers but they cost money and contribute to ecocide, so I clean my crotch in the creek occasionally. But personal hygiene is not a priority. I have dirt under my fingernails, belly button lint, maybe some toejam. I often smell like wood smoke from my campfires. My cologne: eau de burnt alder. Instead of washing my clothing – layers come cheap from thrift shops – I air it out, hanging it on a tree branch for a snowstorm or two, then turn it inside out and put it back into rotation.Cabin fever will kick in if you don’t get out and move around, especially in the winter. I have a 10-year-old laptop and a mile hike to the library gets me some wifi and a battery charge. That and a tinny rechargeable battery-operated radio capable of pulling in the nearest NPR signal which, like picking politicians, is the least of the worst, rounds out my engagement with the madness and spiritual corrosion of capitalism and the society it spawns.I also go hiking, snowshoeing, ice skating or cross-country skiing under a big moon. I can fall back into a snowbank with some home-grown and a pint o’ Schnapp’s and watch the northern lights or just get lost in the night sky.Poverty can be a rough row to hoe. It has forced me to seriously compromise the lifestyle and the values I was raised to expect from my perch in a lilywhite midwestern suburb. During my lifelong descent of the economic ladder, which I attribute to my “don’t care” attitude, I got a closeup view of all the unfairness, malfeasance and destructive aspects of “the system”. I was indoctrinated into it, and have gone from struggling to fit in to rejecting the game entirely and looking for alternatives.As a result, my carbon footprint has shrunk. My presence on this planet leaves little trace, which is how I feel it should be. While that’s pleasing to me, I also understand my withdrawal is meaningless in the grand scheme. The world needs systemic change. In my solitude and self-imposed isolation on the side of a mountain in an undisclosed location, I find it all mildly amusing.Living on the edge of the fringe makes for an interesting experience. A bumper sticker on a four-wheeler that roared past me, destroying my zen and and shattering the stillness of the forest path I was traveling read: “If you’re not living on the edge you’re taking up too much space.” I smirk and can’t help but agree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa108351e4a2a30c271d2dc0f07b3f2adedcc28/40_12_1096_657/master/1096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566a4b67d4e4d713286a58291315a312","title":"a dutch electricians raises issues of trust in iran","story":"Killing at point-blank range of Ali Motamed in the Netherlands shines light on pattern of Iranian hit jobsAli Motamed’s wife had become accustomed to making excuses for her 56-year-old husband. Call-outs for his work as an electrician at the Dutch firm, Eneco, gave a handy reason for missing parties or even weddings without prompting undue curiosity.A quiet, self-contained character around his colleagues, he appeared to them content to stay in watching television at the redbrick home he shared with Galina, 50, and their 17-year-old son on Hendrik Marsmanstraat in the centre of a small estate of cheap modern housing in Almere, a city east of Amsterdam.On 11 December 2015 Motamed had tested his wife’s patience by refusing to go to his brother-in-law’s funeral in France – but he had been right to watch his step that Friday. Two men who had been hired to kill him were sitting outside his home in their stolen BMW, prosecutors would later tell a court.Motamed was saved that day by a late-morning appointment which meant he broke with his usual practice of leaving the house at 6.45am. The assassins, hoping to get to him in the quiet gloom of the morning, were captured on CCTV driving out of Hendrik Marsmanstraat having missed their moment.But Motamed’s luck soon ran out. The following Tuesday, as he emerged from his house into the cold winter air, jogging the few yards from doorstep to bus stop, his killer emerged from the blue BMW to shoot him in the head at point-blank range, before returning to the car and speeding off.Two men, Anouar Aoulad-Buochea, 29, and Moreo Menso, 36, are currently on trial for the murder, an alleged contract killing the Dutch police believe was directed by notorious gangster Naoufal Fassih, known as Noffel on the street, who is already serving an 18-year sentence for arranging a murder for cash. All three men deny involvement.The men accused of the murder had no idea who or why Motamed needed to “sleep”, as it was termed in one of a cache of unencrypted BlackBerry messages, revealed in court evidence. Local police were initially baffled about the motive.But this week the Dutch state made public that they now believe what Motamed’s wife had insisted to police as she was driven to the hospital on the day of her husband’s death: the killing had been ordered by the Iranian government.The killing has opened the eyes of the world to a pattern of Iranian hit jobs, often executed through criminal gangs, that has been seized upon by critics of Iran. To them, the killings raise fresh questions about the trust placed in the country to keep to the contentious accord under which Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia agreed to lift economic sanctions in return for Tehran lowering its nuclear ambitions.The US administration, which pulled out of the deal last year, with the president, Donald Trump, labelling it “rotten”, seized on the development. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the US would redouble its efforts “to put real pressure on Iran”.Motamed’s death was, according to a letter to the Dutch parliament, one of two murders of opponents of the Iranian regime on Dutch territory, alongside the 2017 shooting of Ahmad Mola Nissi, the leader of a separatist movement from the Iranian region of Ahwaz, who was found dead by his son Khaled on the doorstep of the family home in The Hague. He had been shot five times with a gun fitted with a silencer. Police are investigating whether the crime is linked to a gang in Rotterdam.Motamed’s real name was Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi, an Iranian dissident sentenced to death in absentia after fleeing the country in 1981, accused of planting a bomb at the Islamic Republic party’s headquarters, killing 73 people. Among the dead was the second-in-command to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader.Samadi had long known he was on a death list, although he only confided his real name to Galina in 2000, five years into their marriage, and he had withheld the full truth from his son, pledging to tell all when he turned 18.Samadi had avoided events organised by his Afghan wife’s family for fear of pictures of his face emerging on social media. One photograph, taken at his son’s school graduation, appeared on his niece’s Facebook page but he allowed it to be left there “because he had grown older and grey”, and “no one would recognise him any more”, according to the Dutch newspaper, Het Parool. That may have been a misjudgment.Dick Schoof, the director general of the Dutch security service, the AIVD, said that, since the revelation by the government, his intelligence agency was now involved in intense efforts with other countries to research the extent of Iranian interference in Europe.But the truth is that over four decades Iran is thought to have triggered the assassination of numerous enemies abroad, and critics say the west has been culpable in its silence.Suspected targets include dissident Kurds, leaders of the Ahwaz minority sect and members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq organisation, which allied with Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war. Countries in which assassinations are thought to have been carried out include France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the US.“The Iranian regime has a history of targeting the opposition abroad,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, communications director of the Carnegie Middle East Center. “From the Berlin attack to the assassination of former shah officials. This is a continuation of their previous policy. The current wave of killings follows a rise in attacks inside Iran, perhaps driven by the support of its regional adversaries.”In the wake of the Dutch revelation, ambassadors from Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands visited the Iranian foreign ministry in Tehran “to convey their serious concerns” about the regime’s behaviour. Sanctions were imposed on two iniduals, along with the country’s intelligence agency. Yet, as the measures were imposed, officials were quick to insist that there would be no impact on the nuclear accord with Tehran.The murder of the electrician on Hendrik Marsmanstraat, for all that it was a tragedy for his family and an infringement of Dutch sovereignty, may well prove to be merely a fleeting glimpse into the brutal world of realpolitik."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5794f9b7cff35279574c75a6ebb7315cdae185/0_129_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=694c9b4c2db7f1c0f8524364e3280931","title":"stephen fry and pen urge uae to free ahmed mansoor ahead of book festival","story":"Move follows letter to the  ahead of event calling for release of Ahmed MansoorThe former UN human rights commissioner Mary Robinson has pulled out of a literary festival in Dubai after the publication of an open letter by authors, MPs and campaign groups calling for the release of the jailed Emirati human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor.Robinson, a former Irish president, had come under fire after claiming on a visit to Dubai last month that an Emirati princess campaigners said was being held against her will was “in the loving care of her family”.The letter to the , signed by figures including Stephen Fry, comes as a spotlight falls on authors planning to attend the Emirates Airline festival of literature in Dubai, tickets for which went on sale at the weekend.Robinson had been due to appear at the festival on 2 March, according to its website. Her Dublin-based foundation told the  on Monday: “In response to the open letter received by the , Mrs Robinson has advised the organisers that she will not be attending the literature festival.”Tickets are also on sale for talks by authors including Ian Rankin and Douglas Coupland, both of whom have been supporters of the freedom of expression group PEN.The festival, sponsored by the state-owned airline, counts the British cafe chain Costa and Oxford University Press among its 2019 partners. It is being held under the patronage of Dubai’s ruler and the UAE’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.His daughter, Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum, has become the focus of an international campaign after she was allegedly seized from a yacht last year by UAE commandos and brought back to the Gulf state, which her friends said she considered a gilded prison.The letter, also signed by the authors Amanda Craig, Jonathan Emmett, James Mayhew and Nicola Davies, is addressed to the princess’s father and calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Mansoor, who was jailed for posts he made on Facebook and Twitter.“Mr Mansoor’s arrest and the charges against him relate solely to the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association. Therefore, we consider him a prisoner of conscience,” states the letter, which was organised by the International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE.Emmett told the : “The case of Princess Latifa is one of the more high-profile examples of human rights abuses and misogyny in the UAE and has penetrated the public’s consciousness in a way that Ahmed Mansoor’s has not, but both are only the latest in a string of human rights violations in the UAE.“There is a tendency on the part of some authors to think of patrons and sponsors as being separate from those abuses, but they really should give cause for concern.“When you attend a festival like this one, you are lending your respectability to it. Many of the same authors have a massive problem with Donald Trump, and I am sure they would not support something in his name, and yet they seem to have no problem with doing it for Sheikh Mohammed.”The historian Antony Beevor, the novelist Sabine Durrant and the BBC journalist Frank Gardner were among those who confirmed their withdrawal from the festival last year over the jailing of the British PhD student Matthew Hedges. They are not now listed as attendees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2003556dfff918a31163a5b1befd62d181027fce/0_220_4071_2443/master/4071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3f294059b50f57b114234d40f3dc97b","title":"barbies turning 60 in pictures","story":"She is 60 this year and still doesn’t have a single wrinkle!

Over Christmas she received a present of two sports tops from the retailer.“The tops were a little too small for me, so I decided to bring them to Dunnes Stores, Bishopstown, Cork and exchange them for a larger size, on the January 5th,” she writes.She could only find one of the original tops in the shop but “as they had lots of nice sports tops, I picked out two different tops instead and went up to customer services to enquire about exchanging the original two tops for these two new sports tops.”She says the girl behind the counter asked her if she had the original receipt and she said hadn’t as she had received them as a present.“The girl working with her said it was ok to exchange the tops once the Dunnes Stores tags were still on the items. The original tags were on the items, with the price section removed.“The girl proceeded to scan the items and I noticed with surprise that the price of each of the original sports tops came up as being €5. When I queried this (the tops obviously originally cost more than €5), the girl replied that both tops were now discounted to €5 each and as I didn’t have the original receipt, she would only allow me to return them at their current value of €5 each, requiring me to pay the difference on any exchange.”This did not seem like very good value to Maria so she decided to keep the original items and go back to the present giver and see if they still had the receipt for the items.“Just as I was walking away, I remembered that the zip on one on the tops was broken. I went back to the same customer service girl and asked her if the top was broken was I entitled to exchange it for the same top in a bigger size with a zip that worked (as the original item wasn’t fit for purpose)? She said yes, once she had got manager approval that the item was damaged.“I went and got the original top and brought it up for the exchange. I noticed when I was handing it in that the price on it read €25 and not the ‘now discounted price of €5’ that I’d been told.“When I queried this she looked it up on another computer and told me that it was discounted but hadn’t been labelled yet. I asked her were the two new tops I had picked out by any chance been discounted but not labelled but she said no. She proceeded to exchange the damaged original top for the same top in a larger size with a zip that worked.”Maria is annoyed by the policy of returns without a receipt and she wonders if she should have got a credit note for €20 for the exchange on the damaged item, as it was supposedly discounted to €5 at the time I returned it.The original buyer would have paid €25 according to the price tag on it.It is all a bit messy but the retailer is not doing anything wrong.In fact by allowing an exchange without any proof of purchase, it is actually doing more than is required of it by law."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3757298.1547466437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit ireland must hold its nerve says simon coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney: “Now is not the time to focus on plan B.” File photograph: Donall FarmerTánaiste Simon Coveney has said this week is going to be a really significant one for Brexit and that Ireland must “hold its nerve.”He told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, that the Irish Government needs to stay close to both the British government, “our neighbours”, and “our EU partners”.Mr Coveney added that he hopes a letter from the European Union offering assurances on the backstop to the British government will provide reassurance and clarity.The letter, which will be issued jointly by the presidents of the European Council and Commission, will insist that there can be no renegotiation of the backstop.The backstop is a temporary measure that people should not feel threatened by, he said.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May speaks at a  factory in  Stoke-on-Trent on Monday where she  called on MP’s to support her Brexit bill in a vote on Tuesday. Photograph: AFPEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk have released a letter offering clarifications to the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement, stating Brussels “does not wish to see the backstop enter into force” and confirming its determination to see it replaced. In the letter Mr Juncker and Mr Tusk say the Withdrawal Agreement “represents a fair compromise and aims to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union”. The letter says the European Council position is that if the Irish backstop were triggered, it “would only apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided”. It said in such a case the European Union would try and reach an agreement that would replace the backstop, “and would expect the same of the United Kingdom, so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary.” The backstop is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In her response to the EU letter, British prime minister Theresa May said she was confident that there was widespread support for a broad and deep relationship between the UK and the EU. Mrs May wrote: “The clarifications and undertakings proposed in this letter are consistent with the letter and spirit of the deal we have reached, but would be further reassurance that the fears that some hold on both sides are misplaced.”Mrs May said concern that a mutual desire to avoid triggering the backstop would be used as unfair leverage by the EU or by a future British government “is entirely unwarranted”. “I strongly believe the fear about the EU’s intentions is unfounded too,” May added in her response to to Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker.However, she also said the Brexit deal is at risk because of UK parliament concerns about Northern Ireland.  “There are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so”. Blocking Brexit is now a more likely outcome than Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, Mrs May said. The new assurances from the EU comes as Mrs May is due to make a last ditch effort on Monday to convince rebel MPs to back her Brexit orce deal. The future of the United Kingdom’s March 29th exit from the EU is deeply uncertain as parliament is likely to vote down Mrs May’s deal on Tuesday evening, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly orce to reversing Brexit altogether. Facing the deepest crisis in British politics for at least half a century, Mrs May will use a speech in the leave-supporting city of Stoke-on-Trent in central England to say that MPs blocking Brexit is now a more likely outcome than leaving without a deal. “There are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so,” Mrs May will say in a speech to factory workers in the leave-supporting city of Stoke-on-Trent in central England, according to advance extracts. Mrs May warned MPs on Sunday that failing to deliver Brexit would be catastrophic for democracy, and her ministers said that thwarting the outcome of the 2016 referendum could lead to rise in far right populism. As part of the effort to get the deal approved by the British parliament, the EU is due to set out some assurances in a choreographed exchange of letters on Monday, EU officials said. Brussels has repeatedly said however that the deal itself cannot be renegotiated. With no-deal Brexit the default option if May’s deal is defeated, some MPs are planning to pull control of Brexit from the government. Though Mrs May is weakened, the executive has significant powers, especially during times of crisis, so it was unclear how parliament would be able to take control of Brexit. If Mrs May’s deal is defeated and the government is unable to have any amended version passed in the next three weeks, one suggestion is for senior politicians who chair parliamentary committees to come up with an alternative Brexit plan. “We’re in the very, very final stages of the end game here,” said Nick Boles, one of the Conservative MPs behind the plan who said he would vote for May’s deal. “What we need to do is find the solution and if the government can’t find the solution, and we want the government to find the solution and we’ll be voting for her solution - but if it can’t then parliament needs to,” he told BBC radio. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3757226.1547461984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit what s happening this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMPs should finally get to vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal on TuesdayThe EU is expected to publish a letter of clarification emphasising that any use of the Northern Ireland backstop designed to keep the land border open would only ever be temporary, although it will be a surprise if it makes much difference to the Commons arithmetic.Theresa May will also make a public appeal for support in a speech in Stoke-on-Trent in the morning, while MPs move on to day four of the Brexit debate, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, closing proceedings. Monday night is the deadline for submitting amendments to the Brexit motion.If May allows it, MPs will finally get to vote on her Brexit deal, although few believe the prime minister can get it approved, given that more than 100 Tory MPs have said they will vote against it.John Bercow, the speaker, will select which amendments to vote on. The one to watch is the Hilary Benn amendment, which rejects both May’s deal and no deal, and gives MPs a say in what happens next.The prime minister will conclude proceedings, speaking just before voting starts at 7pm. A result on the Benn amendment could come at about 7.30pm. If that falls, the all-important vote on Mrs May’s final deal is expected between 8pm and 9pm. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, could immediately demand to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, if she is defeated. A heavy loss, and Mrs May will face immediate calls to resign.If Mrs May were to prevail, business as usual would commence, starting with prime minister’s questions. But the DUP has threatened to abandon its confidence-and-supply agreement with the government if May’s deal goes through, leaving the Conservatives without an overall majority.A confidence vote could be held on Wednesday, if Corbyn calls for one. It will be hard for Labour to win, because in this scenario, if Mrs May’s deal is voted down, the DUP has said it will support the Conservatives in an attempt to get the Brexit deal renegotiated.If she suffers a heavy defeat – perhaps with 80 rebels or more – she may find she is not able to stay on. A more narrow defeat – 40 rebels or fewer – could encourage her to try to ask MPs to vote on the deal again, although it will almost certainly need to be revised first.Mrs May could make a dash to Brussels to see if there is any hope of renegotiating. If defeated, she has until the close of business on Monday, January 21st, to tell MPs what her plan B is the Commons would then debate and vote on that later in the week.The prime minister could seek a general election, which Labour would support, but her own party may not. Soft Brexiters in the Conservative party could break ranks to see if there is majority support for the UK remaining in the customs union, and even the single market.Campaigners for a second referendum see this as their moment to strike: believing that their idea needs to be the last one standing – the only option that could achieve a majority in the house amid a crisis atmosphere. Except that there would then be an argument about what options should be on the ballot paper.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying.

She felt she’d been warned that spying was only way she’d get out. She had been terrified ever since.Video of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u0026#39s arrest shown on Iranian state TVThe press conference came amid worsening relations between the UK and Iran over the British-Iranian mother’s fate. She was sentenced to five-and-a-half years for espionage in 2016 and despite being eligible for parole she remains in Evin prison in Tehran.Mr Ratcliffe said he would be meeting with Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary, later today.Mr Hunt also summoned Iran’s ambassador to London to discuss the case.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe today began three-day hunger strike, partly in protest at being denied access to medical treatment.She said she will consider extending it if her demands to see a doctor are not met.The 40-year-old had announced earlier this month that she was to go on the strike alongside imprisoned Iranian human rights activists Narges Mohammadi, prompting authorities to ration her food and stop weekly phone calls with her husband.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who worked for the charity arm of Thomson Reuters, has reportedly expressed fears they may also cut off her visits with four-year-old daughter Gabriella.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (R) posing for a photograph with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella (L).Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has suffered a catalogue of mental and physical health complaints since she was arrested at Tehran\u0027s Imam Khomeini airport on April 3 2016.The head of the Thomson Reuters Foundation said Monday she\u0027s sincerely worried about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe going on hunger strike to protest her treatment in the Islamic Republic.Monique Villa said denying her employee medical access, including for new lumps found in her breasts in December, was a form of torture.This is a kind of very slow torture, she told the press conference at the Frontline Club.She also said her employee has suffered severe depression in custody and reiterated she is not guilty of espionage.She\u0027s not spy material, Ms Villa said.She\u0027s innocent. She should be released immediately and she should have immediate medical access.Iranian state TV last week released previously unseen footage of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s arrest, as part of a programme accusing the UK of trying to “infiltrate” the Islamic Republic through the BBC\u0027s Persian language channel.The narrator of the 48-minute programme refers to her multiple times as a “soldier in the army of the counter-revolution at the service of the British intelligence agencies.”A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: The Foreign Secretary has discussed this issue with Richard Ratcliffe, and is keen to take a decision as soon as possible.We continue to take action on all our consular cases in Iran in line with what we believe will produce the best outcomes in their cases.Brexit vote latest news: Theresa May makes last-ditch plea to MPs to back her dealTinder fraudster scammed further victims from prison after obtaining phone while on day releaseNicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond in PR war over \u0026#39smear\u0026#39 her chief of staff knew about sexual misconduct inquiryComment: The political classes are manoeuvring to block Brexit.

This prolonged uncertainty is likely to see the value of UK companies decrease even further.“Most affected are likely to be financial firms and consumer-facing sectors operating mainly in the domestic market. Firms with international operations should be less affected.”Dr Korczak said increasing international operations by opening foreign subsidiaries or relocating assets and staff abroad should act as good “insurance policies”.“Unfortunately, this will have an adverse effect on the local labour market and inidual companies’ activities in the UK,” he added.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

While young people can still find it very hard to get on the job ladder, the report\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspthey have\u0026nbspparticularly benefited those aged 50 and under.\u0026nbspNor has the growth, by contrast to the popular view, been swept up by London and the South East at the expense of the rest of the country. The largest improvements since 2008 have, for example, been in South Yorkshire\u0026nbsp(up 6.5 per cent), and Merseyside (6.4 per cent).There have inevitably been losers as well as winners but the central point - that employment levels are at all time highs and the benefits have been spread widely - holds. Given that it’s always better have a job than not to have one, and there are a lot more of them than Britain has been accustomed to having in previous decades, why they angst?Perhaps it can be explained by another of the report’s conclusions. Yes there are more jobs, but they are also more insecure.\u0026nbspStatistics showing record employment, and ministers’ boastful claims of credit for that, mean little to people constantly worrying about the jobs they have being taken away, particularly when they have financial commitments linked to them,\u0026nbspsuch as mortgages and other loans.Those hardest hit by job insecurity are those in part time or agency work and\u0026nbspthose on the much criticised zero hours contacts. Britain has 780,000 people in that situation,\u0026nbspand 950,000 agency workers. One in seven workers, meanwhile, are now self-employed. All of those figures, notes the Foundation, are significantly above pre-crisis levels.Another issue is that of pay. Average annual\u0026nbsp‘real’ inflation adjusted earnings are still £470 lower than they were a decade ago. Too many people are in jobs that leave them struggling to cover their outgoings. The Conservative Party’s cuts to welfare have not been compensated for by the increases they have made to the minimum wage, which has\u0026nbspled to the phenomenon\u0026nbspof rapidly\u0026nbsprising\u0026nbspin work poverty.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

No one talked about football.Or, if they did, in England, they only made passing reference to the FA Cup matches. But, of the fervent attention normally devoted to the Premier League, there was not a mention.Saturday and Sunday were cup days. And without the Premier League, they felt quite flat as a result.It’s incredible, just how tight is the Premier League’s grip on the national psyche. From a standing start in 1992, it’s grown to become Britain’s most successful brand. You don’t believe me, you’re not that interested in football and you’re attributing my claim to the hyperbole that surrounds the elite of the beautiful game?Mahabis collapse should give other firms pause for thoughtA Populus poll found that far and away the most recognised British brand in the world was the Premier League. They tested 20,000 people in 20 countries with 10 of our best-known names – and the Premier League dominated, miles ahead of the likes of BBC, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar Land Rover, and yes, even the royal family.Hard to imagine, given the stacks of souvenirs for the House of Windsor on sale to tourists in the gift shops, the crowds that flock daily to stand and stare at Buckingham Palace, and the coverage heaped upon Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, but, overall, more folk worldwide are interested in the outcome of Man City v Liverpool.Remarkably, as well, reports GlobalWebIndex, the consumer profiling firm, a bigger proportion of the population watches Premier League matches on TV in Thailand, Egypt and Indonesia than in the UK. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University Business School, interviewed by Mat Snow for managmenttoday, the clever bit was in making the Premier League competitive.The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – ‘co-creation’ or ‘prosumption’ to use the vogue wordsAll the Premier League members have a share (the bottom three are replaced each year by the three coming up) and nobody has more muscle than others. This means that relative to rival leagues overseas, the difference in financial reward between top and bottom is actually fairly small (£150m to the champions Manchester City last season, £95m to bottom-placed West Brom). Because the playing field at least in this regard is reasonably level there is a chance, always, of an upset – that lesser clubs can afford to buy good players and give a decent account of themselves. They can, witness Leicester City, with a fair wind over an entire season, go on and win the thing.Of course, such largesse does not extend to the depth of the owner’s pocket or the strength of support and size of the stadium. So Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham enjoy the advantages of additional wealth and spending power. But at least where a share of the TV rights is concerned, the spoils are distributed more evenly.What every Premier League team needs in the January transfer windowIt’s this competitiveness that makes the Premier League so appealing. Says Chadwick: “On holiday in Sicily in 2012, a group of Swedish guys were watching Barcelona on TV. I was saying how wonderful they were to watch – Messi, Iniesta and so on – but they said, ‘No, this is terrible: it’s just pass, pass, pass. We like the Premier League – it’s fast and intense, a battle between big aggressive guys and quick, skilful little guys.’ It’s basic and primitive. Premier League football is about competing – to survive, to protect our identity, to ward off hostile forces.”What the Premier League\u0026nbsphas mastered also is the art of consumer involvement. Ironically, it’s the aspects that English football used to be so criticised for, says Chadwick, that have become its advantage. “I cannot advocate a sanitised, quiet, perfectly civilised afternoon, a tea party where we kick a ball around. A lot of the Premier League’s strengths, the speed of the game, the tribalism, the passion, are all caught up. If people were not irrationally involved it would not be the great league that it is.”The Premier League has successfully tapped in to consumers’ desire to be part of the creation of a product – “co-creation” or “prosumption” to use the vogue words. Other corporates need to take a look at the Premier League’s success. It’s easy to mock the hype surrounding the league: the vast payments from TV and sponsors, the cost of tickets, the stars’ enormous earnings. But these, along with the breathless excitement of radio phone-ins, Match of the Day, and Sky, complete with its pioneering computer-generated graphics and Gary Neville’s technical analysis, all add up to a compelling package.Involving consumers, giving them a say, listening to them, explaining the product, taking it apart, inspiring loyalty, talking about it – these are all key ingredients in the enticing Premier League mix.The days when customers were encouraged to stay apart, to remain detached, and to take a back seat are long gone. Fans need, and want, to be engaged, to be asked about the business, to feel as though it belongs to them, that they somehow part-own it, and are responsible for its development and evolution.This means taking them with you, communicating to them treating them as equals, and not speaking down to them, not hiding or obfuscating. A tall order, but one that others have managed, not just the Premier League. Richard Branson steered Virgin to heights because he made passengers feel they were sharing in the airline’s journey.The Premier League is back this weekend. I can’t wait. See, that’s the effect it has\u0026nbspthat’s its achievement.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Forsman\u0026nbsphad been working as a photographer for a while, but\u0026nbspshe had only had a few stock images listed on Getty, one of the biggest stock photo agencies. In 2014 she learned\u0026nbspabout Stocksy,\u0026nbspa platform co-operative, which puts the photographer in charge of their own work.\u0026nbspWhy co-operatives could be the answer to the UK\u0027s social care crisisThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeThe sharing economy is failing because people can’t be trustedProfessional photographers find it much harder to make money out of stock photographs since\u0026nbspsmartphones and social media have opened up the field to amateurs. Many aspiring photographers now sell stock photos at a loss to try and make a name for themselves. Agencies have a steady flow of this under-priced content, making it harder to professionals, who are stuck in one-to-one relationships with little bargaining power, to command worthwhile fees.“Photographers can\u0027t act as a group for their interests against exploitative agencies,” Forsman says. “The co-op model makes the photographers organised as an agency, which means that there is nobody to exploit them.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMike Cook, acting chief executive of Stocksy, says putting the workers in control of the business was “a no-brainer”.“Why don’t all businesses work this way?” he says. Stocksy has high-standards for artists that means it can command higher fees, avoiding a race-to-the-bottom in the industry. At Stocksy, photographers get between 50 and 75 per cent of the proceeds when their stock photos are used, significantly higher than the 30 per cent or less offered by other agencies.Forsman says: “This makes it much easier for me to depend on stock for revenue, because the co-op does not exploit contributors but instead seeks to make their work financially sustainable.”Co-operatives have been around since the 19th Century, but technology has opened up new possibilities for how they are run. Next-generation platform co-ops, which bring together global communities of traders in an industry, have been seen as one answer to the problematic gig economy. They are an alternative to top-down platforms like Uber and Airbnb, where executives profit from gig workers who may lack the security of a proper contract and benefits like holiday and sick pay.Platform co-ops are growing in popularity in the UK. In December Equal Care Co-op, or Eccoo, started recruiting care workers in the Calder Valley for a new kind of social care, where those receiving and giving care are in charge of the business, including how much they work and for how long. Rather than changing a commission and extracting value from the workers and those receiving care, Eccoo provides a platform for workers and those receiving care to choose one another and gives them control over how how and for how long they are supported.Eccoo is offering a vital alternative to care agencies that pay minimum wage to employees who have little say over their hours and may be fired on a “one strike and you’re out” system. “The biggest issue for me was having the reassurance of getting enough work and having theright amount,” says Fran Watson, a founding member of Equal Care and an independent care worker. “I know of no independent care workers who do 15-minute slots. You just can’t do it. The options are either to go with an agency or go it alone.”Forsman, a London-based photographer (Courtesy Photo)But a major hurdle for these co-operative is how to give workers or members\u0026nbspa meaningful say in how the company is run, especially when those members are in different timezones.In 2017, New Internationalist, a magazine dedicated to social justice and equality, raised £704,114 through community shares. It became a multi-stakeholder owned\u0026nbspco-operative, offering its readers the chance to own the magazine in return for securing its future. But editorial staff are still working out how readers will contribute to decision-making\u0026nbspat the magazine without compromising its editorial independence.“The feelings range from anxiety about what ceding control would look like to excitement about what that represents,” says Hazel Healy, an editor of New Internationalist. “I think it would be hugely beneficial to us and a great experiment to deepen the democracy further but it’s going to need to be cleverly done.”\u0026nbspStocksy\u0026nbspmight have the answer. New Internationalist has been talking to Stocksy about software it has invented\u0026nbspto support decision-making among artists from all over the globe. When Mike Cook first joined Stocksy, the business was making decisions the old-fashioned way, by members submitting motions that were voted on at an annual general meeting.\u0026nbspThis model had its limitations for members that were based in different timezones and speaking different languages. So Stocksy created a system where a contributor can submit an idea, however vague, into a forum for discussion. Members are sent an email to vote if the idea should be advanced. When a minimum quorum of 10 per cent of members have voted yes to a proposal, it is advanced to the board where it can either be approved, or go to a vote.\u0026nbspThe system has already been used to give members the say on whether the membership cap at Stocksy should be lifted. Cook says the decision was one of the most contentious the co-operative had ever faced. “We have customers who love our content but tell us that we don’t have enough. We have worked with our members to create more content where we can, but we have a bell-curve of members, from stay-at-home parents who take photos part time, to full time photographers, make their living from stock.”The membership cap of 1000 artists was forcing Stocksy to prioritise more productive photographers. “It’s hard to say you must produce more or we cut you off,” Cook says. “This is what the cap was making us do, we realised when we got close to the cap we might have to replace some users with more productive ones.”\u0026nbspAt the same time, longstanding Stocksy contributors were worried that lifting the cap would “open the floodgates” of contributors, Cook says, watering down the agency’s reputation for quality. Sara Wager, a hobbiest astrophotographer who creates one or two images of the stars each month, joined Stocksy in 2017. She worried that lifting the cap might stop photographers with a smaller output from contributing. “I reached out to the Stocksy folk and they understood that I have niche images that can take many months to complete and so my uploads will be sporadic,” she says. “They really put my mind at rest that I was as valued a member as anyone else.”Sara was also able to participate in forums discussing lifting the cap. When the proposal was voted through, the board reached a compromise where members could vote to freeze membership each year, depending on how many contributors have been added. “This combination of informal talk, transparency and more formal processes of voting means that I feel a belonging and co-ownership to the co-op,” says Forsman.\u0026nbspStocksy, which employs 29 people at its base in British Columbia and several more in the US, sells photos to larger agencies, tech companies and other business. It had revenues of $10 million in 2018, making it much smaller than standard industry agencies like Getty and iStock. But its business model means that the photographers can command a fairer price than they might at much larger agencies. Cook says that while their decision-making processes might take longer, the transparent process means that photographers feel a sense of loyalty and community at Stocksy that is missing elsewhere.“I realise in the wrong company I’ll sound like a raving socialist,” Cook says. “But the reason we have a business is the contributors, so why shouldn’t they fairly profit from that? It’s not socialism, it’s fairness.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This prolonged uncertainty is likely to see the value of UK companies decrease even further.“Most affected are likely to be financial firms and consumer-facing sectors operating mainly in the domestic market. Firms with international operations should be less affected.”Dr Korczak said increasing international operations by opening foreign subsidiaries or relocating assets and staff abroad should act as good “insurance policies”.“Unfortunately, this will have an adverse effect on the local labour market and inidual companies’ activities in the UK,” he added.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

The probe is shown adjusting its altitude, speed and pitch as it seeks to avoid obstacles on the ground.\u0026nbspResearchers hope that low-frequency observations of the cosmos from the far side of the moon, where radio signals from Earth are blocked, will help scientists learn more about the early days of the solar system and birth of the universe\u0027s first stars.\u0026nbspThe far side has been observed many times from lunar orbits, but never explored on the surface. It is popularly called the dark side because it can\u0027t be seen from Earth and is relatively unknown, not because it lacks sunlight.\u0026nbspThe pioneering landing highlights China\u0027s ambitions to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space through manned flights and the planned construction of a permanent space station.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

It is gutter politics.\u0026nbsp“History shows us appeasement only emboldens the far right and impoverishing the country through Brexit will only increase resentment.”Ms Soubry, who was branded a Nazi\u0026nbspby a mob who targeted her during live television interviews outside parliament on Monday, described Mr Grayling\u0027s comments as irresponsible nonsense.She tweeted: The 15 yobs who have been roaming outside parliament do not represent anyone but themselves. It\u0027s shameful to validate them in this way.Right-wing extremists have always existed. Brexit is just an excuse - this is their real agenda.Pro-EU MP Luciana\u0026nbspBerger\u0026nbspaccused Mr Grayling of “cowering behind the small threat of far-right extremism” to avoid offering the public another referendum.The Labour MP, who has been subjected to relentless abuse and death threats, said: “These remarks are not only grossly irresponsible but also show just how desperate supporters of this proposed withdrawal agreement have become.“We absolutely need to heal isions in our society but we will not do so with a Brexit that makes us poorer and offers less control.“And the answer to a small band of far-right thugs roaming the streets must never be to capitulate and restrict our democratic engagement – it must be more democracy.”Labour veteran Roy\u0026nbspHattersley\u0026nbspdismissed the claims as “absurd”, adding: “I don’t think many people would regard Chris Grayling as an expert on these matters.”Lord\u0026nbspHattersley, a former Labour deputy leader who backs a Final Say referendum, told BBC Radio 4’s\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme: “Nobody voted for Mrs May’s package.

Conservative eurosceptics, who are set to rebel en masse on Tuesday, want real changes to the withdrawal agreement to give the UK the ability to leave the backstop whenever it wants – or a time-limit on it.Though both the UK and EU say the backstop ought never be used, in\u0026nbspreality it is likely to become the de facto relationship between the UK and EU for many years, because the prime minister\u0027s proposals for frictionless trade – a requirement to replace it – have been rejected. She has produced no alternative plans and rejected those suggested by the EU.Labour says it cannot back the plan because it does not meet its tests of keeping the benefits of single market membership and a customs union. It has also criticised the backstop in its current form.Trade deals take years to negotiate and most trade experts say it is unrealistic to expect a deal to be concluded before the backstop comes in at the start of 2021. In the letter, the EU chiefs assured Ms May that the transition period could potentially be extended to prevent the backstop coming into force – though there are limits to how long it can be dragged out for.Tory Brexiteer appointed to Privy Council agrees to back PM\u0027s dealSenior MPs to table legislation for fresh referendumBrexit impact hits UK business by 16 per cent, study findsTheresa May says Brexit may not happen unless MPs back her dealThe Tories will lose young people for good over BrexitThe transition itself is not popular with eurosceptic\u0026nbspMPs, some of whom have claimed it amounts to vassal status. During the period, the UK would have to follow all EU rules, including new ones, with no say in drawing them up.In her letter to the EU the prime minister had said the “deal is at risk” because of “concerns in the UK parliament about how we are delivering our commitments in relation to Northern Ireland’s border with Ireland”.She said that worries could be “mitigated by changes to the backstop itself”, naming suggested “proposals for a way in which the UK would choose to exit the backstop unilaterally were it ever to come into force, or for a hard time limit on the duration of the usage of the backstop”.Speaking in Stoke-on-Trent on Monday morning after the letters were exchanged, Ms May said the EU’’s assurances “make absolutely clear the backstop is not a threat or a trap”.Created with Sketch.

If the EU refuses, she would have to revoke Article 50.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe bill would introduce a clear mechanism for delaying or reversing Brexit where one does not currently exist.\u0026nbspResponding to the publication of letters from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer says:\u0026nbsp“The prime minister has once again failed to deliver.\u0026nbsp“This is a long way from the significant and legally effective commitment the prime minister promised last month. It is a reiteration of the EU’s existing position. Once again, nothing has changed.”Theresa May is asked, by the Daily Mail, about the prospect of staying in a customs union with the EU. She again rules this out, saying it would stop the UK making trade deals with countries around the world.\u0026nbspSky News asks the prime minister if\u0026nbspshe is confident she can get her deal through Parliament tomorrow. She\u0026nbspsays she is working on this, but again refuses to say that she thinks she will succeed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May is now onto questions.\u0026nbspBBC News ask\u0026nbspif she genuinely believes she can win tomorrow\u0027s vote. The prime minister says she is speaking to colleagues and will continue to do so today and tomorrow. Some MPs have changed their view and are now saying they will back the deal, she says, but refuses to say the thinks she can win.\u0026nbspITV News asks\u0026nbspwhy Parliament shouldn\u0027t seize control of Brexit. May\u0026nbspsays what is important is delivering on the result of the referendum. She is concerned about the real prospect that we could see people in Parliament trying to operate in a way that frustrates Brexit.Talking about this morning\u0027s letters from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, Theresa May admits she did not achieve a legally-binding guarantee on the backstop, and that the EU was clear it would not re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, but says\u0026nbspshe has\u0026nbspsecured\u0026nbspvaluable new clarifications and assurances, including a clear statement that the future UK-EU relationship does not have to be based on the terms of the backstop.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May says failure to deliver Brexit would cause catastrophic harm, adding:\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve never had a referendum in this country where we have no honoured the result.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe does, however, change the line about the Welsh devolution referendum after it emerged that the original line, released by No 10 as a preview, was false (see earlier post).\u0026nbspInstead of claiming the result of that referendum was accepted by both sides\u0026nbsp(it wasn\u0027t - the Tories opposed it), she says it was accepted by Parliament.Theresa May says there are clearly different views on the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspShe says her own view is that while we could ultimately make a success of no deal, it would cause significant disruption in the short-term.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe again tells MPs that the only way to avoid no deal is to vote for her proposed agreement.\u0026nbspTheresa May is now speaking in Stoke.\u0026nbspShe says:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn June 2016, the British people were asked by MPs to take a decision: should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or should it leave?\u0026nbsp“In that campaign, both sides disagreed on many things, but on one thing they were united: what the British people decided, the politicians would implement.\u0026nbsp“In the run-up to the vote, the Government sent a leaflet to every household making the case for remain. It stated very clearly: ‘This is your decision. The Government will implement what you decide.’\u0026nbsp“Those were the terms on which people cast their votes.\u0026nbspIf a majority had backed remain, the UK would have continued as an\u0026nbspEU member state.\u0026nbsp“No doubt the disagreements would have continued too, but the vast majority of people would have had no truck with an argument that we should leave the EU in spite of a vote to remain or that we should return to the question in another referendum.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0027s Brexit speech in Stoke is due\u0026nbspto get underway shortly. It will be interesting to see whether she drops the line comparing Brexit to the 1997 referendum on Welsh devolution.\u0026nbspThe parts of the speech that Downing Street released in advance included a claim that all parties had accepted the result of the Welsh people\u0027s vote in favour of setting up a devolved assembly. She was due to say:\u0026nbsp“When the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3 per cent, on a turnout of just over 50 per cent, to endorse the creation of the Welsh Assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned.\u0026nbspThat quickly unravelled when it emerged that Ms May herself voted against devolution, despite the referendum result, and the Conservatives\u0027 2005 manifesto pledged to hold another referendum on whether to keep the Welsh Assembly or abolish it.New: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is to summon the Iranian ambassador to the Foreign Office to voice fresh concerns about the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is beginning a three-day hunger strike today.\u0026nbspThe dual British national has been imprisoned in Tehran since April 2016, accused of spying for the UK, which she and the government strongly deny.Hotel giant Travelodge is to target unemployed parents as it looks to address a Brexit recruitment crisis amid a decline in applicants from EU countries.The firm\u0027s boss saying Travelodge can no longer wait for Theresa May to come up\u0026nbspwith a plan and instead will be launching its own hiring programme to help parents return to work.Chief executive Peter Gowers said:We\u0027ve become more proactive. We can\u0027t wait around like two men on a park bench waiting for Godot for the Government to decide what the post-Brexit machine is going to be.We are preparing in earnest for post-Brexit Britain. With thousands of new jobs to fill, we need more new colleagues than ever.\u0026nbspPlease allow a minute for the liveblog to load“What if we found ourselves in a situation where parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a Remain vote?” she said.“People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm.”Ms May’s warnings have been rejected by twelve former Tory ministers,\u0026nbspbelieved to include Boris Johnson and former\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspsecretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab,\u0026nbspwho\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspwritten to MPs calling on them to vote down her proposals.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

So hardly a ‘coup’.“Would also point out that liaison ctee (sic) doesn’t draft legislation or conduct pre-legislative scrutiny.”The Sunday Times reported at the weekend upon a backbench bid, said to be led by Dominic Grieve, to rewrite Standing Order 14 of the commons rules dictating that government business takes precedence, effectively giving the backbenches control of the way ahead.Twelve Conservative former ministers also wrote to Tory MPs urging them to vote against the prime minister’s Brexit deal, including Boris Johnson and former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, arguing that doing so may encourage the EU to come back to the negotiating table.But the last-ditch attempt to maximise Tory opposition to the PM’s deal comes after four fellow Brexiteers said they will back the agreement, despite speculation they would vote against it.The MPs, including Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and Sir Edward Leigh, said they would support the government in the meaningful vote.Tory former minister Andrew Murrison said he also had reservations, but had decided to back the deal, as did MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, Caroline Johnson.Mr Murrison is also tabling an amendment to the Brexit motion to create a “sunset clause” preventing the hated ‘Irish backstop’ extending beyond the end of 2022.The amendment backs Ms May’s deal, subject to a legal ‘codicil’ to the withdrawal agreement which states that the backstop must end by December 31 of that year.Ms May has also received the public support of a respected veteran Labour backbencher, Sir Kevin Barron, a former Commons standards watchdog chief.The MP for Rother Valley, said he was “truly saddened” that some MPs were trying to “overturn” the 2016 referendum result, adding: “I know it will disappoint many within my party but I will be voting in support of the prime minister’s deal on Tuesday as that is the only option on the table that truly enacts the promises that I made to my constituents and avoids the horror of a no-deal Brexit.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is going to be very hard”.The biggest Commons defeat on record was by a majority of , against the minority Labour government in .The largest post-war defeat was by , on the Callaghan minority Government in .Meanwhile, Business Secretary Greg Clark became the most senior Tory to publicly break ranks and call on all MPs to make fresh compromises for a softer Brexit deal yesterday.As the PM’s authority continues to collapse, the Cabinet minister appeared to have already dismissed any hope of the PM winning the key vote next Tuesday.Instead, Mr Clark branded no deal “a disaster” and WTO terms “a dire prospect”.And he called on Parliament to “move quickly and act responsibly”.He added: “Parliament needs to recognise we need to put dferences aside. I hope colleagues in the days ahead will recognise our collective responsibility to get a deal”.No refused to slap down Mr Clark, in a sign of the PM’s weakness, but said “disaster” was not a word the PM would use.The DUP, whose  MPs the PM relies on to prop up her minority government, also kept up their hard line.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It doesnt matteryoure on holidays or on a night out and off the clock. When nobody  knows what to do, everyone turns to you and hopes you can fix it.It means coming home from work, exhausted,  having to keep to yourself what happened on the ward today because its too upsetting to talk about. .It means calling your loved ones as you leave work after a particularly tough day because you need a voice on the other end to talk to. It doesnt matter what you talk about, just something to distract you from bursting into tears as you walk to your car.It means getting up for work the following morning, brushing it all off and going at it again because you are a nurse, this is what you do and you love it.I am not a nurse.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres what happensMay loses.Theresa May has warned MPs that no Brexit at all is more likely than a no deal.A no deal is widely thought to be the worst possible option, meaning the UK would have to cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period.In this scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.A no deal would also see residency rights for EU nationals in the UK potentially disappear overnight.It would also lead to huge uncertainty over what would happen at the  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In terms of parliamentary procedure, the European Union Withdrawal Act sets out the next steps should Parliament reject the Government’s Brexit deal.However, because of the delayed vote, MPs have passed an amendment which will force the PM toto Parliament with a fresh plan within three daysher deal is rejected.But it remains to be seen whether MPs can form a cohesive solution to Brexit, with no specic outcome favoured by the majority of MPs.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has raised the possibility of calling a General Election.Speaking ahead of the meaningful vote in Wakefield, Yorkshire, he said: “Let there be no doubt: Theresa Mays deal is a bad deal and Labour will vote against it next week in Parliament.“If the Government cannot pass its most important legislation then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity.But Corbyn has been vague about the timings of this proposed election.Nearly a million people marched in support of a Peoples Vote, campaigning for a second referendum to be held on Brexit.But both the Conservatives and opposition party Labour have all-but ruled out the possibility of another vote.We say all but, because just about anything could happen right now.Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Layla Moran and Caroline Lucas are among the MPs who have been vocal in their support.And even Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said she can see a plausible argument for a Peoples Vote on BrexitParliament fails to reach a consensus.May has survived a vote of no confidence from her own party, meaning she cannot be challenged for another three years by her colleagues.However, Labour could call a vote of no confidence in the Government - which leader Jeremy Corbyn has threatened to do.The Leader of the Opposition would have to table a motion that “That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government”.MPs then vote, with a simple majority needed to succeed.On the Andrew Marr show, Corbyn promised that Labour would call a no confidence motion soon, but has refused to comment on whether that would be as a reaction to Mays Brexit plan."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000461147403-e1547465502935.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"toby perkins labour mp mistress amanda collumbine","story":"Perkins, , began an affair with mum-of-two Amanda Collumbine, , after making her his top aide.She replaced dedicated Chris Bowen, , who was later gagged with a £, taxpayer funded payout.Miss Bowen signed a non-disclosure agreement in December  stopping her from discussing his alleged behaviour towards her.Cheating Perkins went on to have an affair with Mrs Collumbine in July last year but was rumbled three months later by his heartbroken we, Suzie, .Fuming Mrs Perkins stormed out of their home in Chesterfield, Derbys., and went missing for several hours -

as shes set to reveal fresh promises from the EU over the Irish backstop.As British politics enters a momentous week, academics predicted her almost certain defeat will trigger the biggest political crisis since World War Two.Ahead of it yesterday as the tension ratcheted upIt only deepens the PM’s appalling dilemma and will now see a serious split in the Tory party, whatever she does.If, as all expect, her deal is heavily torpedoed by the Commons, Mrs May must either go for no deal and alienate Tory moderates, or soften Brexit with Labours help and lose the support of the Leavers.In a further blow for Mrs May, The Sun can also reveal the big beasts’ demand is backed by the DUP.The Ulster unionist party chief will share a  with Mr Davis and Mr Raab tomorrow to spell out their demands to the EU in greater detail.In the letter, leaked to The Sun, the Brexiteers write: “We urge colleagues to look beyond the day-to-day news cycle, to consider the long-run future of our country, and to vote against this agreement.“By voting down this flawed Withdrawal Agreement we can encourage the EU to renegotiate and take out backstop or all out a unilateral right to leave it.“The EU will need to remove the most problematic parts, notably the backstop, or provide a method by which the UK has the unilateral right to leave it.“In the event that the EU is unwilling to commit to this, then we can and must fulfil the democratic wishes of the people of the UK.“That is why,it is the only way forward, we must have the confidence to be ready to leave on WTO terms.”The Brexiteers admit in the letter that leaving without any deal would cause economic pain – which they dub “some short-term inconvenience and disruption”.But they insist “the much greater risks” are to agree to be locked into “a very bad deal” that enforces a customs union on the UK for as long as the backstop lasts.As Westminster braced itself for a historic week, the almost sure defeat of Mrs May’s deal will spark the biggest political crisis since World War Two, academics predicted.Renowned historian Lord Hennessy said British politics will enter “a multiple crisis” over what to do about Brexit, the country’s unwritten constitution, Westminster’s two party system and voters’ faith in politics in general.Peter Hennessy added: “All of that adds up to a crisis with a capital C”.The PM will deliver a speech today in a Labour-voting town that also strongly backed Brexit, in a bid to ram home her point to wavering Labour MPs.Sounding the alarm about Remain MPs plotting to keep the UK in the EU with Speaker John Bercow’s help, the PM will tell factory workers in the Midlands: “As we have seen over the last few weeks, there are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so.”She will issue her strongest attack yet on MPs wanting to reverse Brexit, saying: “I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy.“Whatwe found ourselves in a situation where Parliament tried to take the UK out of the EU in opposition to a remain vote “People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm.”Mrs May won a small boost last night as four wavering Tory MPs declared they would voting for the PM’s deal – Sir Edward Leigh, Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown, Caroline Johnson and Andrew Murrison.But an honours controversy surrounded veteran Eurosceptic Sir Edward’s decision, as it came just two weeks after he was made a Privy Counsellor.Another Leave-backing Labour MP, John Mann, also pledged to support it but admitted that very few of his colleagues planned to do the same, and he’d be surprised “surprisedit’s anything like enough to get this deal through”.Projections still put Mrs May on course for a catastrophic defeat by around  votes – the biggest for a Goverment on record.A raft of senior Tories began to public with alternative courses of action to end the crisis.The most controversial came from pro-EU rebel leader and former Attorney General Dominic Grieve.Mr Grieve – who was also accused of plotting with Speaker John Bercow to reverse Brexit - revealed he is among a cross party group of MPs and peers to have now drawn up a new bill that would bring in a second EU referendum.Working alongside Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, the former Cabinet minister dubbed it “an escape hatch” for Mrs May to end the deadlock.Sir Vince also claimed a Commons bid to soften or reverse Brexit by handing power to MPs was indeed underway, and he was even “talking to Cabinet ministers” about joining it, adding: “It’s not a conspiracy, but it’s clearly happening”.But he and other plotters were rounded on by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who warned them it would be a “huge mistake” to kneecap the Government by changing the Commons rules to allow any MP to pass laws.Former Tory PM John Major stepped up his call for Mrs May to pause Brexit by revoking the Article  departure process for now.A “new process” of national consultation is now required, the ex-party leader argued, to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit.But Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay signalled what was likely to be No’s Plan B by suggesting Mrs May will call a second vote on her deal after some tweaks.He told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show strongly suspects the Commons will end up voting for “something along the lines” of the current deal.It was also reported yesterday that the EU assurances on the deal – which could come today - will fall signicantly short of Tory MPs’ demands.Letters from Brussels bosses will pledge their “firm determination” to end the backstop by January , but without any commitment to do it.There is also expected to be a promise to expedite trade talks so a deal can be in place as quickly as possible, limiting theof any backstop or its need at all.But Tory hardline Brexiteer Mark Francois dubbed them “meaningless”, adding: “A love letter doesn’t change the terms of the treaty”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crucially, it shows how quickly a peoples vote can be delivered.On the other side of the debate, Brexiteers are tabling an amendment which would limit the duration of the hated Irish backstop to no more than a year.Tory MP Andrew Murrison said: The amendment I am tabling will address the concerns I have heard expressed by a large number of colleagues across the House about the potential forever nature of the backstop.It will introduce a sunset arrangement by which the backstop will fall away.It has been claimed EU leaders are preparing to delay Brexit until July or possibly longerParliament cannot agree a deal.The news comes as it was revealed Brexit heavyweights have written to all Tory MPs calling on them to vote down Theresa May’s deal tomorrow – as she declares there are  hours to save Brexit.The dozen, including Boris Johnson, demand in their Plan B letter that the PM issue the EU with a final ultimatum for a better deal when hers is voted down on Tuesday - and prepare to leave without one."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000461726342.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit vote latest eu irish backstop","story":"EU bosses wrote to the PM promising to start trade talks as soon as this weekMPs sign off on the withdrawal agreement, so the backstop will never be needed.But Mrs May was forced to admit shed failed to convince them to put a time limit on the mechanism - meaning Britain could still be tied to the EU indefinitely.The gambit is unlikely to be enough to stop MPs voting down the deal in Parliament tomorrow evening.As Mrs May faces her moment of truth:The letter from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker declares that the backstop - designed to stop a hard border in Ireland - would be a bad outcome for both sides.And it insists that the mechanism is not designed to trap Britain in the EU customs union, or carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.But the letter stops short of declaring that Britain and Europe will definitely strike a trade deal by the end of  which would make the backstop unnecessary.That means it may fail to win over Tory MPs worried that the backstop would leave the UK permanently tied to Brussels and unable to set our own trade policy.Mrs May said during a speech in Stoke-on-Trent today: I pursued a proposal for a fixed date - with legal force - guaranteeing the point at which the future partnership would come into force.The EU’s position was that - while they never want or expect the backstop to come into force - a legal time limit was not possible.I fully understand that the new legal and political assurances which are contained in the letters from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker do not go as far as some MPs would like.She will make a statement to Parliament today laying out the details of the EUs offer.In their letter, Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker wrote: The commission can confirm that, just like the United Kingdom, the European Union does not wish to see the backstop enter into force. Were it to do so, it would represent a suboptimal trading arrangement for both sides.The Commission can also confirm the European Union’s determination to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland by a subsequent agreement that would ensure the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.The top Eurocrats said thatMPs back the withdrawal agreement tomorrow, the EU will sign it immediately - allowing talks on the future trade deal to start as soon as this week.They said the talks would prioritise finding a hi-tech solution to the Irish border, using smart technology to avoid any checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.And they added thatthe backstop did come into effect, Britain and the EU would hold a summit every six months to find a way to end it while Northern Ireland would get a veto on any new laws coming from Brussels while the arrangement was in force.The backstop would see the UK stay in Europes customs union until an alternative way of keeping the Irish border is agreed - meaning Britain would have no choice but to accept EU rules on trade and customs arrangements.Critics blasted the exchange of letters as nothing more than a fig leaf which doesnt change the facts of the deal.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: The Prime Minister has once again failed to deliver. This is a long way from the signicant and legally effective commitment the Prime Minister promised last month.Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of Mrs Mays DUP allies, added: Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns.Instead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.Brexiteer Will Quince, who quit the Government over the deal, said: This letter from the EU, welcome as it is, does not offer legally binding assurances on the backstop. Therefore my position remains unchanged and I will not be voting for the withdrawal agreement as it stands.In the past  hours half a dozen MPs from both main parties have announced they are backing Mrs Mays deal when it comes to a vote tomorrow night.But she is still thought to be on course for a heavy defeat - meaning shell have to unveil a Plan B within days.In her Stoke speech this morning, Mrs May claimed thather deal is voted down, Britain will be on course to stay in the EU for good.She said: As we have seen over the last few weeks, there are some in Westminster who would wish to delay or even stop Brexit and who will use every device available to them to do so.“I ask MPs to consider the consequences of their actions on the faith of the British people in our democracy.“People’s faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harm. We all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.”Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC: I think No Deal would damage our economy - Ive been frank about that - but I think its survivable. I think no Brexit, politically, is a disaster from which we might not recover.This afternoon the House of Commons will resume its debate on the withdrawal agreement which started last week.The debate will be opened by Dr Fox, and closed late tonight by Chancellor Philip Hammond.Tomorrow will be the final day of debate, followed by the vote around pm.If Mrs May loses the vote she will have three working days toto the Commons and announce what her alternative course of action is.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell today said Labour would launch a bid to unseat the GovernmentMrs May loses the vote on her deal.Asked about the timing of a no-confidence vote, he said: Its just a matter of timing so watch this space over the next  hours."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460519499.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady freedom of speech not harassing mps","story":"Both are important and much cherished rights that have been fought for over the years.But something really scary is happening in this country. I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence. And she is not afraid of anyone.OLIVIA Colman is a national treasure.We have all loved her since Peep Show and will raise a glass on the happy day she is named a Dame.But I can’t help worrying that Olivia is just a teeny-weeny bit over-exposed.Colman is everywhere.Picking up a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite. About to be seen on Netflix as Queen Elizabeth in series three and four of The Crown.As Madame Thénardier in the BBC’s adaptation of Les Miserables.Fronting UNICEF charity appeals and popping up in British Airways safety videos.

But with the DUP set to back the PM in that event, it is unlikely enough Tories could be persuaded to vote against their own Government. Jeremy Corbyn told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “We will table a motion of no confidence in the Government at a time of our choosing, but it’s going to be soon.” Mr Corbyn hinted a Labour win could push Brexit back from March . He said he is against a second referendum and would rather renegotiate with the EU, putting him at odds with over % of Labour members. He would call for a permanent customs union, access to the single market and protection of rights and privileges. He told Mr Marr: “An election would be February, March, there’s only a few weeks between that and the leave date, there would have to be time for those negotiations.”  Labour Chief Whip Nick Brown told BBC Sunday Politics North East and Cumbria: “We have made contingency plans for a confidence vote.” Labour Leaver John Mann, who has tabled an amendment to Mrs May’s deal to protect workers’ rights, has said he will back the deal. Sir Edward Leigh became the fourth Brexiteer backbench Tory to vow to back the deal. He said: “The only way to deliver Brexit is to vote for the deal.” But days before the vote on the UK’s break with the EU, Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg was snapped on a break in Czech capital Prague. Military planners have been sent to the Foreign Office, Home Office and Department for Transport in a bid to avoid border chaos in the event of a no-deal.

The backbenchers say their new Bill would allow a Commons committee to take control from flailing Theresa May and put forward its own Plan B. That would include BLOCKING a No Deal Brexit, according to the three ex-ministers, Nick Boles, Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan. The bid comes as Mrs May gives two last-ditch speeches to avoid her deal suffering the biggest Commons defeat since WW. In a speech in Leave-backing Stoke-on-Trent, the Prime Minister will warn MPs cancelling Brexit is now more likely than No Dealits voted down. She will then address Parliament from .pm, where she is expected to unveil a last-minute offer from the EU. But MPs are already deep in talks to take back control.   The trio of Tories are set to publish the European Union Withdrawal Number  Bill, which would see the Liaison Committee - a supergroup of MPs - take a key rolethe PMs Withdrawal Agreement is rejected. He told BBC Radio s Today: This bill would do the following. It would give the Government three more weeks to get a compromise deal, a plan B, through Parliament so that we are leaving the EU on time on March  with a deal. If that failed, it would then ask the Liaison Committee, which is the committee of all the chairs of select committees and other parliamentary committees, it would give the Liaison Committee the responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal, which would have to go back to the House for a vote.   If the House passed that compromise deal, then the Government would be legally required to implement whatever it was that they had. Askedthe plan represented a coup by MPs, Mr Boles told Today: Its a funny kind of coup which requires a majority vote of democratically-elected MPs before the task start rolling. So, no, it isnt a coup, its an expression of parliamentary will. Downing Street lashed out at the plan as extremely concerning. The PM’s official spokesman said: “Clearly any attempt to prevent the Government from meeting all the legal conditions for an orderly exit at this moment of historic signicance is extremely concerning. The British public voted to leave the EU and it’s important that elected politicians deliver on that verdict.”  Mr Boles said, under the bill, MPs would be acting onlythe Government had failed and failed and failed again, with a failure to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons on Tuesday and no new ideas in the following three weeks. He told Today: There are other compromises out there which could secure a parliamentary majority and what we want is the PM to be the person who secures that.  What MPs need to understand is thatshe fails then we are not going to allow a no-deal Brexit to happen and that is what this bill secures. But the chairwoman of the Liaison Committee, Tory Remainer Sarah Wollaston, said last night she had not even heard of the bid. Its part of a flurry of parliamentary skullduggery in the final hours before the vote on the Brexit deal on Tuesday at pm. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK.

According to BuzzFeed, Tory MP Andrew Murrison is laying an amendment backing the deal but onlythe backstop lasts no more than one year. And yesterday Theresa Mays allies accused MPs of a coup in a separate plan to seize control of the Commons timetable. But Leave-backer Boris Johnson dismissed supposed plots as “nonsense”. John McDonnell praised MPs behind the supposed coup saying it would redress some of the imbalance thats build up over decades between parliament and government.  I actually think this is most probably parliament at its best, he told the BBC. Inidual MPs are behaving properly. Theyre listening to their constituents... and theyre coming to decisions based upon not party advantage, not career moves, but what is best for the people they represent. The Shadow Chancellor added: We will do everything we possibly can to prevent a no deal... well work through whatever mechanism is available to us to prevent that happening. A delay to the March  Brexit date is likely, Mr McDonnell added, because Theresa May has run down the clock.

Ms McVey said the concerns raised by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, John Major and the Chancellor Philip Hammond are done so by arch remainers. She said the stories in the newspapers are another kind of project fear and that we have got to take away the side shows and just look at what is in law. But reports emerged today that the EU is preparing to delay the date of Brexit until at least July.  The March  exit date is written into British law, but can be extended with the agreement of both sides. EU chiefs signed off a -page Brexit blueprint last month - and the Prime Minister will put it to a vote in the Commons from pm on Tuesday.

But EU chiefs have said that is impossible and insisted they would not renegotiate the deal - only give more assurances around it. That was a red line for Tory Brexiteers and the DUP. Mrs May must present her Plan B for Brexit just three working days after a defeat, on Monday  January. But her Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was unable to say what itll be, instead suggesting Plan B will along the lines of Plan A. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to trigger a no confidence vote in the government soon after a defeat on Tuesday night.

The one that set up the Welsh Assembly in  - despite being won by a margin under %. Imaginean anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people, Parliament knew better  she was set to declare. The problem is, it seems that is EXACTLY what she, Theresa May, DID say to the people of Wales. And she was forced to rewrite the quotes after Welsh party Plaid Cymru accused her of lying or a blatant bid to try and rewrite history. As she faces the biggest Commons defeat since the Second World War, and unveils a desperate last-gasp offer from the EU in Parliament, is her extraordinary claim explained - and debunked.  Theresa May was due to make the comments in a speech to factory workers in Stoke-on-Trent, which voted heavily to leave the EU. Her argument - hours before her Brexit deal is expected to be defeated in the Commons - was itd be undemocratic to ignore the  referendum. In extracts pre-released by No, she was due to say: On the rare occasions when Parliament puts a question to the British people directly we have always understood that their response carries a profound signicance. When the people of Wales voted by a margin of .%, on a turnout of just over %, to endorse the creation of the Welsh Assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned. Parliament understood this fact when it voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article . And both major parties did so too when they stood on election manestos in  that pledged to honour the result of the referendum.” She was due to add: Imaginean anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people of Scotland or Wales that despite voting in favour of a devolved legislature, Parliament knew better and would over-rule them. Or  force them to vote again.  Theresa May personally voted against a Bill to set up the Welsh Assembly, AFTER the people of Wales had voted for one by .% to .%.  Yes, really. Shes making this claim despite personally voting to, critics say, reverse a referendum. Parliaments records show she was one of  MPs, mostly Tories by the looks of it, who voted unsuccessfully to kill off the Government of Wales Bill on  December . That was three months after the referendum was held on setting up the Assembly. The MPs in their amendment said there were legitimate fears about the protection of geographic and cultural minorities and the proper resourcing of Wales to reflect need. Ironically, they also warned devolution could harm Wales voice within Europe.  Perhaps Theresa May would be forgiven for opposing the Welsh devolution referendum three months after it happened. Surely she changed her mind pretty quickly  After all, the Welsh Assembly was up and running from , with its first set of elections, People could move on. Erm... no. The Tories carried on trying to open opportunities to abolish the Welsh Assembly - even after it was up and running.  The  Tory manesto was pretty supportive, saying: As Conservatives have demonstrated in our constructive participation in the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, we will work to ensure devolution is a success. But the  Tory manesto rowed back - promising a second referendumthat could abolish the Assembly altogether. It said: In Wales we will work with the Assembly and give the Welsh people a referendum on whether to keep the Assembly in its current form, increase its powers or abolish it. It added: Devolution has brought problems of accountability at Westminster.  Plaid Cymru have accused Mrs May of lying. The partys Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: The Prime Minister’s Brexit desperation has led to her either having a selective memory, deploy wilful hypocrisy or simply lie about the referendum on Welsh devolution. The Conservative Party campaigned against devolution and then promised a second referendum six years after it was established. The Prime Minister herself voted against the legislation which created the National Assembly for Wales, after the referendum. Unlike the unicorns of the Brexit referendum, the  devolution vote was a clear question, with a clear outcome and clear a concequences. The only party to attack it legitimacy was her party - this is hypocrisy of the highest order. Mrs Mays revisionist history shows a disregard for Wales, devolution and democracy. The Prime Minister should retract the statement and apologise. Welsh Labour Stephen Doughty, of the anti-Brexit group Best For Britain, said: “This is a very strange example for the PM to use - not least given she herself voted against implementing the Welsh referendum result, and the Tories continued to oppose it for years afterwards! But unlike Brexit - the Welsh Assembly grew in public support after the referendum. Brexit has headed decisively in the opposite direction - which is why the people should have the final say.” How did she change her speech  What Theresa May was due to say She was due to say: On the rare occasions when Parliament puts a question to the British people directly we have always understood that their response carries a profound signicance.

The -year-old said: My baby son was born on New Years Day and myself and my partner Lorencia went for something to eat.   Lorencia was breast-feeding Ben and I was eating hot wings. She was wanting to eat her food so askedI could hold him while she ate. Id wiped my hands on a napkin, as you do, and was holding him.

Paul then put a status on Facebook saying: Apparently five-day-old babies dont like it when their dads put their fingers in their mouths after eating hot wings. Unintentionally by the way. Lol. But a couple of days later, on Tuesday, the police knocked on his door. The barber shop owner added I opened the door and asked what was up. They replied you dont know then  and I said I didnt have a clue.   Thats when they told me that I had apparently been feeding my son hot sauce. I just said are you taking the p*** , mate  Annoyed and upset that someone had reported him, Paul left it up to his partner to explain the situation to the officers. He said: I was actually quite tearful that someone had called the police. My girlfriend then asked the officerstheyd even read the Facebook post. They hadnt, so they were shown it and they just looked embarrassed. They apologised and admitted that they shouldnt have been called and then left. I cant believe, with our stretched police force, they were sent out without looking into it properly. It was absolutely disgusting, it just tarnished the whole Christmas season. A Cleveland Police spokesman said: “Police received a call from a member of the public regarding concern for the welfare of a baby on Tuesday  January. “As a result, two officers were deployed to an address in Stockton to speak with the parents of the baby to understand the circumstances of the report. “Officers were satisfied that the baby was safe and well and there were no further enquiries carried out.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family portrait ruined dogs getting","story":"NewsFamily portrait ruined by dogs getting it on as photographer takes pictureThe Bornovski family were shocked as dogs Finn and Nemo got frisky as they posed for a picture at their home in Koror, PalauShareCommentsByJasmine Kazlauskas:,  JAN NewsThe hilarious picture has gone viral across Facebook \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pair of randy golden retrievers have hilariously ruined an innocent family portrait by getting it on in front of the camera.

It was so hard watching my son lying helpless on the floor like that.”  The mother is afraid the attack could have been a lot worsea police car hadnt passed by. “I could have found my son dead at the street. They could have killed him,” she added. A voice on the -second video is heard saying ‘He thinks he’s a gangster as another jumps on the victims head. The victim’s mother says the incident was reported in October, and has urged police to make progress with the investigation.  She said: I have given them the footage and the names of those involved but so far nothing has been done. It’s almost three months since this happened and they still haven’t done anything. It’s shocking. My son deserves better. Inspector Tracy Harkins, of Paisley community policing team, said: “We have carried out a number of enquiries in an effort to identy those responsible. “We have worked to locate a number of iniduals and two youths have now been charged.” Two boys, aged  and , have been charged over the attack and a report has been sent to the Children’s Panel.

Daniel Protheroe has vowed revenge after coming back to discover all his possessions wrapped up. Friend Scott Lewis, , spent  hours carrying out the prank, along with friend Tom Harcourt, Wales Online reports. Scott, a soldier in the st The Queens Dragoon Guards, decided to prank Daniel, who had left his door unlocked at their barracks in Norfolk whilst he was away on a skiing trip. He spent around  hours completing the prank, which saw the pair cover every inch of the room in silver foil.  From his bed, to the shower curtain, the TV and even the toilet, every possession in the bedroom and bathroom was wrapped in the foil, including his toiletries in the bathroom. Scott said: It took me and my friend Tom the best part of  hours and near enough  rolls of m foil. Dan was away skiing with the regiment over the holiday period and he left his door unlocked so to teach him a lesson about kit security and locking your stuff up we decided to foil his room and teach him a lesson to lock up next time.  His reaction was pretty relaxed as he appreciated it more than anything when seeing the attention to detail after a few minutes. It took him over three hours to take everything off and he still hasnt completely taken everything down as hes living with what he needs most removed. Dan, , from Port Talbot, said: I wasnt annoyed, I was more impressed with how good it looked.  Ive never had a key for my room so I couldnt lock it anyway. It took me nearly three hours to take it down. The bathroom was the most annoying bit to take down because there was so much tape. Im going to get him back, karma is going to bite him.

Blair Jennings, , is just one of two people in the world with the rare condition and suffers from cleft palate, epilepsy, sleep apnoea, hip dysplasia, glaucoma and hearing dficulties. Other symptoms of his condition include periventricular shyleukomalaciaand Pierre Robin syndrome, which causes facial malformations. He has a duplication of one chromosome at five parts - which only one other person in the world is known to have, reports the Daily Record.Blairs PVL will eventually develop into cerebral palsy but without diagnosis he will be unable to access vital services at Cerebral Palsy Integrated Pathway Scotland .  His worried parents Pamela and Adam, from Glasgow, said Blair has been refused shyphysiotherapy and speech therapy which he urgently needs. Pamela, , a former nursery worker said: “It seems that because Blair couldn’t jump up and run about after physio, we were discharged. “We were left feeling really low that physio had given up on him.” The toddler has been enrolled at the Craighalbert Centre in shyCumbernauld, which provides shyeducational and therapy services for children affected by shyneurological conditions.  But the facility will cost the family about pound a year for him to go there just one morning a week. Pamela said: “Because Blair doesn’t fit into one neat little tick box, he is being denied all the support he should be getting. “Blair is desperate to be walking and talking but there is no support available for him and no co-ordinated care between thehospitaland community. “If children have autism or cerebral palsy, there is a shyframework to support them but for children like Blair, no one wants to take responsibility. “They are happy to let Blair get on with it.” Blair’s cleft palate wasn’t diagnosed until five weeks after his birth- leading him to be deprived of proper oxygen and nutrition during that time.  Pamela said: “He wasn’t feeding properly and his breathing sounded so laboured. “When we saw the consultant, he said we could have been there in dferent circumstances. We were lucky he was still with us.” Blair has been forced to undergo three eye surgeries, cleft surgery, gromit insertions in his ears, a testicular operation and a tonsillectomy. He faces another three shyoperations on his eyes, ears and around his hip joints this year. Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said Pamela and Adam were “hitting a wall” in their attempts to get support.  She added: “It shows the system is not working for this child. “Blair’s family are left having to fight for him and pay for private therapies. That is scandalous.” Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board said: “He is reviewed regularly by a range of specialist staff from acute paediatrics and community services. “Blair’s mum had not indicated that she was unhappy with his care and as soon as we were made aware of this, Blair’s consultant neurologist immediately rang his mum and a meeting with the family to address their concerns was offered.  “This meeting will include clinical colleagues from shyCommunity Child Health. “A speech and language therapy plan was agreed and he receives active physiotherapy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"random acts kindness children tsb","story":"AdvertorialThousands of children asked to perform an act of kindness - and the results are adorableOrganiser says the generosity of the kids has been overwhelmingShareByDave Masters:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN AdvertorialMore than  schools took part in the challenge\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBig-hearted Alison Bunce is dedicated to making her community more compassionate - one act of kindness at a time. She has been inspired by an international movement to spread kindness and her new focus is teaching children to be kind. Alison founded Compassionate Inverclyde in Scotland last year and recently launched a new programme called ‘High ’ working with  local schools and thousands of primary age children to demonstrate the simple act of kindness. She developed lesson plans for the schools to implement that is now seeing them create things like ‘kindness quilts’ and handmade friendship bands. “Children are like sponges -you show them the way they will quickly follow,” said Alison. “One school - St Michael’s Primary in Port Glasgow - are doing some beautul kindness quilts that are being given out to the local community. They also present a balloon to a child in assembly who has been particularly kind.  “Other children can nominate a child to be awarded. We as an ordinary community have the responsibility to give back. It is up to us to foster and empower young people to show kindness.” Compassionate Inverclyde has been chosen as a TSB Local Charity Partner for the bank’s Greenock, Port Glasgow and Rothesay branches. Alison, who is trained as a palliative nurse, first set up the social movement to help people at the end of their lives. The ‘No One Dies Alone’ campaign frees up clinical resources in hospital wards and works with a hospice and in care homes and was inspired by the concept of Compassionate Cities developed by Professor Allan Kellehear, an Australian public health academic. Alison is now working with teenagers in the local area including -year-olds at Notre Dame High School in Greenock. “I have about  girls who have nicknamed themselves ‘The Kindness Girls’. They work with people in care homes, the homeless and with premature babies. At this moment in time they are fundraising to put together ‘starter packs’ for parents. Things like baby-grows and wipes.  “I am also working with some -year-olds at St Columbas High School, Gourock, who we are teaching to implement the High  programme and lesson plans to younger pupils. Some of them want to be teachers and this gives them confidence and an idea of planning and communication skills. It also connect them with younger pupils. I want to to raise awareness and promote resilience.” Local children are also involved in a project called ‘Back Home Boxes’, where anyone who lives alone and is being discharged from Inverclyde Royal Hospital is gted a pack of household essentials, with every item donated by the public as well as children and their parents. The box even includes a homemade blanket and card made by the children. More than , boxes have been distributed since the scheme started last year, with  helpers packing and delivering them to patients in Inverclyde Hospital twice a day. One recipient wrote to volunteers and said: “In all of my  years I have never experienced such kindness. This box has touched my heart so deeply.” Alison said: “The dference it has made is amazing. These are people who are going home and there is not even a pint of milk in their fridge. It’s all about kindness. The generosity of the children - and wider community - is overwhelming and of course I could not do it without my team of volunteers. They keep everything running.”For more Stories of Local Pride, click here"},{"url":null,"title":"social supermarket sells weeks shopping","story":"NewsInside social supermarket selling a weeks shopping to desperate Brits for just £One woman helped by the Community Pantry in Crewe, Cheshire, was so desperate she was eating dog biscuitsShareCommentsByChris kitchingMatt Jackson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe Community Pantry organiser Natasha Maroni inside the shop \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA social supermarket has opened offering a weeks worth of shopping for just pound to Britons who struggle to feed themselves and their families.

Theresa May’s fatally flawed plan that will make Britain poorer and weaker deserves to be killed off tomorrow, when the PM will be rightly hammered in the House of Commons vote she never wanted. Yet this is not the end of the beginning – never mind the beginning of the end – of a poisonous national crisis created by fibbers and fuelled by porkies. Truth is the first casualty when fanatical Brextremists invent myths to create a phony land at the centre of a new empire.   For all May’s plastic Churchillian rhetoric, she is a gutless appeaser. The leader of the first Government in history to be found in contempt of Parliament has a cheek to be popping up in a factory in Stoke-on-Trent today to pose as the most unlikely champion of democracy. She deserves to be defeated and ousted for trying to appease Tory headbangers who continue to lie about Britain’s past, present and future. May knows that reforming and remaining in Europe is the best deal, and nothing has changed when she refuses to declare publicly that she would vote to leave the EU in another referendum. And even for an unprincipled Minister, cabinet incompetent Chris Grayling hit a new low by appeasing Far Right extremist thugs who are manipulating Brexit as a vehicle for violent racism. May is wasting her timeshe believes that Labour collaborators will save her tomorrow, when no more than  opposition MPs are expected to back the May mess. Ingrained Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn vows to move fast after the Prime Minister’s defeat to table a formal no-confidence motion in the Tories. Yet the Labour leader will face intensive party pressure to support calls for a people’s vote , as they will, the Tories resist the general election they would lose. Labour is split too, as meetings of Corbyn’s team last week underlined – with Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer heading calls for a shyreferendum, and party chair Ian Lavery leading the resistance. Admittedly, there is no easy way forward from a hazy verdict achieved by deceit and illegality in a previous Parliament’s dishonest referendum. But  container-loads of toys put aside by The Entertainer chain tell us Brexit isn’t fun and games.

The low temperatures, have been forecast by The Weather Company, and the Met Office has warned almost anywhere could see the snow after the weekend. Widespread snow could be seen on Saturday and Sunday, ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond, from WeatherTrending told the Daily Star reports. Huge snowfall around the continent has been blamed for at least  deaths this week, including skiers in Austria and Norway. States of emergency have been declared in Germany and the Balkans, while huge avalanche smashed through a hotel in Switzerland.   Britons are being warned to prepare for weeks of severe wintry weather, including snow, ice, widespread frost and severe gales. Travel chaos is also expected as the effects of the plummeting temperatures are felt across the UK, with possible issues on railways, roads and airports due to “signicant” snowfall and thick sheets of ice. Polar air starts Britain’s cold run tomorrow with heavy snowforecastin northern England and Scotland on Thursday. The Met Office said snow could fall “almost anywhere” after the weekend, with colder-than-averagetemperatures until mid-February. Forecasters believe the cold snap could be Britain’s worst freeze since last winter’s “Beast from the East”, which plagued the country with extreme winter conditions for days.   Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “It turns colder through Tuesday night and Wednesday and all the evidence points towards the longest cold spell since March. “There could well be colder-than-average temperatures from this week until mid-February at least. “There’s an increased risk of widespread snow.” High pressure over Britain has kept the cold weather at bay so far this winter, which has been mostly settled and mild.But from mid-January, the Met Office said much colder weather is possible as freezing air from the east could engulf Britain via Siberia and Scandinavia.   John Hammond, forecaster for WeatherTrending said: “There is a signicant risk of more widespread snowfall next weekend. “Sharp frost and wintry showers will become more widespread in the week to January . “The harshest spell of winter is threatening from January .

Several eyewitnesses filmed the phenomenon in Mexico City and uploaded the footage to social media expressing concern about the lights that they claim was accompanied by a strange noise. According to local media, the mysterious lights were caused by two electricity transformers exploding in the borough of Cuauhtemoc on the evening of Sunday, January .

From places so ancient, visitors are banned to doomsday communes designed to save the human racethe end of the world ever comes - you wont find any of these spots in a travel book. And in many cases, neither would you want to. James Bonds secret bunker  If James Bond author Ian Fleming designed a military base, Royal Air Force Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire, would be it. It looks like something from a science fiction novel, filled with white domes. But that isnt the weirdest thing about the facility, opened by the British War Office in . The site is believed to be home to the largest electronic monitoring system on the planet and is used to gather intelligence for both Britain and America. It was originally opened to monitor the Soviet Union and was vital during the Cold War. But the work of its , staff is now shrouded in mystery.  It was claimed, by researcher Dr Steve Schofield in  that those working at the base had been involved in drone attacks, although this has never been confirmed. RAF Menwith is also thought to have close ties with ECHELON, the global spy network dubbed Five Eyes and involving the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. ECHELON was created on the late s to monitor communications coming from the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. But since then it is thought to have evolved into a global ssysrem for the interception of private and commercial communications. In other words - mass surrveillance. So, it could be true that someone is always listening... Secret cave that can feed the world - literally   Weve all seen the films - the ones where the world is destroyed by a freak natural disaster. But whatThe Day After Tomorrow actually happened  How would the handful of people survive once the apocalpyse was over  Well, it turns out plans have been in place for years to ensure humanity could continue to feed itself - and the secrets are locked away in a mountainside in one of the most isolated places on earth. Every, single seed ever known to mankind is stored inside the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. It sounds like something from Star Trek but the giant cave - filled with million crop seeds - really does exist. And its the most closely guarded - and secret - seed bank in the world. Built to stand the test of time and located on a remote island half way between Norway and the North Pole - so not somewhere thats easily accessible to say the least - it is the worlds largest collection of potential crops. Opened in  the vault has been described as the ultimate insurance policy for the worlds food supply, offering options for future generations to overcome the challenges of climate change and population growth.  Its location was carefully chosen to ensure the seeds survival - evensomething resembling the end of the world occurred. It is covered in natural permafrost, which means the seeds will remain frozen - unless disaster strikes and theyre needed. And while the entrance is visible, the vault itself it more than  metres inside the mountain, well above sea level - should the worst happen. The Forbidden Isle and home to the real-le Family Robinson It looks like the perfect tropical destination and the smallest of the populated islands in Hawaii. With its swaying palm trees, crystal blue waters and some of the rarest animals on earth, Nihau sounds like the most perfect of holiday destinations. But it wont make it on to anyones must-see travel list because outsiders arent allowed. The island, which has a population of just , was bought by Elizabeth Sinclair from the Kingdowm of Hawaii in  for just ,. From there it passed onto her descendants, the Robinson family, and has remained in private ownership ever since. No one can step onto the island unless they are specically invited by one of the residents, earning it the nickname The Forbidden Isle. To ensure this is upheld, the coast guard constantly patrols the island to make sure there are no unauthorised landings. And those living there take their isolation very seriously. There are no paved roads, phones, plumbing, running water or shops. Nihau is the only island in Hawaii where Hawaiian is still the primary language and children are educated in a school powered by solar energy and taught to thrive off the land. A Navy installation provides work for many of the islands population, along with living off the land. They supplement their income by selling shells and shell jewellery made from the tiny shells washed onto Ni-haus shoreline in the winter months. But despite its minute size, the island and its population had a key role to play during World War Two when a Japanese pilot, Shigenori Nishikaichi, crash landed there. He was originally captured by the residents, only to escape with the help of three locals of Japanese descent. Nishikaichi then took hostages before he was killed by two Niihauans, Benehakaka Kanahele, who was decorated for his bravery, and Kealoha Kanahele. While there is still no tourist accommodation on the island, since  hunting safaris have occassionally taken place where people can pay to hunt eland, aoudad, oryx, wild sheep and boars. The top secret town Mezhgorye is a totally closed town in the Republic of Bashkortostan in Russia. It was founded in  and at the last census had a population of , people. Very few photographs exist from inside its town limits but it is thought several huge construction projects took place there in the height of the Cold War in the mid-s. And the mystery of what happens in Mezhgorye doesnt end there. Close to the secret town there is said to be a huge underground facility, deep in the Ural Mountains. No one knows the actual size of this complex but there are rumourscould be more than  miles square and houses Russian artefacts and treasures, a huge supply of food and even a nuclear bunker. At the end of the Cold War in the s it was reported that tens of thousands of workers, presumably from nearby Mezhgorye, had been involved in the building of the underground tunnels and bunkers. But to this day, no one knows what really goes on behind the walls of one of the worlds most secret towns. The deadly island  People are necessarily banned from North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal - but were not sure anyone would actually want to go. The island is home to the Sentinelese - a tribe who, often violently, rejects any contact with the outside world. Travel to the island was banned in  to protect those living on the isolated crop of land as they had no immunity after living completely untouched by any other humans. This was relaxed last year to allow researchers with pre-approved clearance access to the island - but people should very much approach at the peril. In  two fishermen were killed by by the Sentinelese when they tried to approach the shore.   And late last year American missionary, John Allen Chau, was murdered when he went to try to convert the tribespeople to Christianity. His friends say he had become obsessed with those living on the island. Pal John Middleton Ramsey said: He knew of the dangers of this place. Chilling images have emerged of Mr Chaus body being dragged across a beach by the Sentinelese. Indian authorities do not prosecute the Sentinelese for killing non-Sentinelese people and there are no plans to try to recover Mr Chaus body. Ancient caves that were mans first home  Having suvived for , years before their discovery in , the paintings in Lascaux Cave, France, truly are one of the wonders of the world. For decades visitors were allowed to marvel at the artwork until it was discovered all that extra carbon dioxide produced by thousands of tourists was damaging the ancient drawings. Now, only a select few scientists can visit some of mans earliest pieces of art. Weathering the storm Another secret place that sounds like its stepped straight out of the pages of a sci fi novel. Mount Weather in Virginia, USA, is a doomsday bunker of epic proportions. Designed to be the operational hub of the US Federal Government in the event of a natural of manmade disaster, Mount Weather is housed in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Opened back in World War Two, the complex was brought into use following the   attacks in New York when most of the leading members of the US government were evacuated there. Huge in size - , square feet at least - the complex also houses valuable paintings, which were transported there between  and . As well as above and below training facilities for military personnel, Mount Weather is also believed to have its own air circulation pumps and a TV and radio station so those in charge can keep abreast of whats happening on the surface. US officials are denied access to the complex, meaning its also believed to have its own fire and police departments. Ghosts of the Black Death   Tourists and locals alike are banned from Poveglia Island in northern Italy. The tiny patch of land in between Venice and Lido in the middle of the Venice Lagoon was once used as a quarantine zone for people suffering from the Bubonic Plague in . When Italys population was decimated by the Black Plague more than  years later, it once again became a place of suffering. And its dark past doesnt end there. As recently as the s, the island was used as a mental asylum.  The hospital opened in  but reports of widespread abuse and torture soon reached the mainland. It is even said the screams of those who were treated on the island can still be heard today. Now, it has a truly sinister reputation as one of the most haunted places on earth. It has been estimated as many as , bodies remain on the island and there have been regular reports of hauntings and ghostly apparitions. Buildings lie abandoned and in ruins, with nature reclaiming what was once its own.

Ex-club DJ Ye Ming Yuen, who went to pound,-a-year Westminster School, will be flogged  times with a ft-long rattan cane while partially naked and tied to a large wooden trestle. The -year-old faces the punishment - called barbaric by his family - after he was convicted of seven drugs offences, including trafficking cannabis and crystal meth, in the former British colony. The case of London-born Yuen, who was originally facing a possible death sentence, has sparked a row between Singapore and the UK and prompted Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to intervene.   British officials made clear they strongly oppose the use of corporal punishment, and Mr Hunt raised the case with Singapore’s foreign affairs minister Vivian Balakrishnan during a visit last week. Human rights groups opposed to caning say it breaches the UN Convention Against Torture. Yuen was arrested in August  and again in February last year, and is being held at Changi prison. He was originally facing a charge that carries a possible death sentence, but it was dropped because the drugs weighed less than g.   Yuen, who moved to Singapore in , was sentenced to  years in jail and  strokes of the cane - the maximum allowed under Singaporean law. His family, who live in the UK, have begged officials to grant him clemency, and his appeal for a reduced sentence of eight-and-a-half years and  strokes of the cane was denied. In his appeal, he described himself as being misled in his youth and becoming an addict while surrounded by drugs. His father Alex, , told the Times that he was too harsh with his son when he was a boy, adding: He had a troubled le. I did not not how to nurture him.   He added: My father caned me, so when he was young I caned him. The businessman said his sons case is a miscarriage of justice because the court did not hear mitigating circumstances - including being at risk of gangland reprisal for identying his supplier - before he was sentenced. He claims his son got into drug dealing while working as a DJ to do a favour for his friends. Yuens younger sister, a -year-old development manager, told the Daily Mail: Without warning, the prison guards knocked on his cell to impose his caning sentence in early December.Ming exclaimed it was against his human rights. After hearing this, they did not proceed with the punishment.  The prison guards went to get him again two weeks later. Ming repeated the same explanation, and again the caning did not proceed. The authorities do not give advance warning of caning which is mentally torturous. It could happen any day. Yuens family said he only has a bamboo mat in his cell and he is forced to spend  hours inside the room every day. They claim he is allowed just two visits from family per month. Yuen is the son of a marketing consultant from China and a Singapore-born marketing executive, it was reported.  He attended Dulwich Prep School in south London and then Westminster School, later moving to Singapore and becoming a top club DJ. Yuens father said his son fled to Singapore after the police in London found out the young man was making fake IDs for his school friends. He said that led to a rt and he didnt speak to his son until he was arrested. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: “Our consular staff have been assisting a British man and his family since his arrest in Singapore in . We strongly oppose the use of corporal punishment, such as caning, in all cases. The Foreign Secretary personally raised this with the Singaporean Minister for Foreign Affairs earlier this month.” Foreign Office travel advice In its travel advice for Singapore, the Foreign Office warns: Penalties for drug offences are severe and can include the death penalty. Possession of even very small quantities can lead to imprisonment, corporal punishmentor the death penalty. It adds: Trafficking is defined by possession of drugs above a certain amount .

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blether broughty athletics britton signed for forfar","story":"In a new feature, I’ll look back on the information which appeared in newspapers when local footballers stepped up to the senior grade.From February  . . .Forfar capped Saturday’s - win over Queen of the South by signing Broughty Athletic right-back Billy Britton after the game.Twenty-one-year-old Billy, who lives in Dundee, has filled the right-back berth like a veteran in his two trials for the Loons.A stuffy defender, he showed a flair for attack against Queens, too.Billyhad a spell with Cha colts, but had the misfortune to break a leg."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c38c3795e14a4.56177788.jpg ","title":"dundee council could ban cars from busy city centre streets","story":"Cars could be banned from one of Dundee’s most polluted streets under “radical” plans being considered by the council.City development convener Lynne Short said the city centre would likely be “reshaped” to discourage the use of conventional cars and encourage an uptake in public transport and cycling.Ms Short said that while plans were at an early stage, unconventional measures were being considered by council officers.“There are a number of options that we will look to explore, looking at places such as the Seagate,” Ms Short told the Tele.“At the moment, it has very narrow pavements and a very wide road, so it could have a completely dferent shape in the future to encourage active travel.“That all depends on funding, of course.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-swimming-pool-latest-to-close-due-to-technical-issues","story":"SWIMMERS in Galashiels have faced a high and dry start to the new year.The towns pool was closed due to mechanical problems on Monday, December .And despite repairs being carried out during the planned holiday closure staff were unable to open the doors again on Thursday or Friday.A spokeswoman for operators Live Borders said: \"Following improvement yesterday , we are hopeful of getting the temperature up to suitable level and reopening over the weekend.\"We apologise for any inconvenience this closure may have caused.\"This latest closure comes just days after Selkirk Swimming Pool was closed for a week in the run up to Christmas for similar technical problems.We reported last month how during   attendances at swimming pools, gyms and other sports facilities across the region had fallen year-on-year in   by more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"good-behaviour-order-for-bowden-man-after-new-year-bust-up","story":"A BOWDEN man involved in a New Years Day bust-up with his partner has been ordered to be of good behaviour for the next three months.Graeme Reid pleaded guilty to shouting and swearing during the incident.The -year-old also admitted threatening his partner with violence and repeatedly striking the door of a house in Dick Road.The case will recall at Selkirk Sherf Court on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"organisers-hope-to-rekindle-peebles-torchlight-procession","story":"ORGANISERS of Peebles Hogmanay Torchlight Procession are hopeful the spectacle willthis year ndash after cancelling the  event to give volunteers a break.Event director Neil Dalgleish told us: ldquoWe have had a full on year and we wanted to give volunteers a deserved break at the new year with their families.ldquoA huge amount of work goes into organising the event and we will have to start preparing now for .The procession has taken place in the town since .

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

letter would win over enough MPs to rescue her Withdrawal Agreement looked set to be dashed, as the Democratic Unionist Party ndash which props up her minority administration ndash dismissed it as ldquomeaningless.ldquoRather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns, said DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who called on the PM to demand changes to the Agreement itself.Mrs May warned that MPs would be behaving with the ldquoheight of recklessnessthey rejected her Withdrawal Agreement in Tuesdayrsquos historic vote, when no alternative deal was on offer which was negotiable and respected the  referendum result.The Prime Minister said that the presidentsrsquo letter provided ldquovaluable new clarications and assurances to address the concerns of MPs who fear the backstop, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland, could become a permanent arrangement which the UK could leave only with approval from the EU.She said the letter delivered:ndash A commitment from the EU to begin work on a new post-Brexit relationship as soon as the Withdrawal Agreement is ratiedndash An explicit commitment that the new relationship does not have to ldquoreplicate the backstop arrangement, under which the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU and be required to observe some of its rulesndash Agreement on a fast-track process to bring a new free trade agreement into force, evensome of the  remaining members delay raticationndash Acceptance that the UK can unilaterally deliver on commitments made to Northern Ireland, including a

to MPs concerned about the danger of a no-deal Brexit to back her.ldquoThe only ways to guarantee we do not leave without a deal are: to abandon Brexit, betraying the vote of the British people or to leave with a deal, and the only deal on the table is the one MPs will vote on tomorrow night, she said.ldquoYou can take no-deal off the table by voting for that deal.

I suggested that the shape of unknown women might not be any of his business and that it is considered impolite to comment.He told me that I was \"heavy\". \"You need to look after yourself better,\" he said. \"Theres no excuse for young women not to look after themselves and for young women to be overweight.\"A light dawned. In certain circles, this is a tactic called \"negging\" and this hard nonsense is not unusual. The idea is that the man insults his intended in order to tap in to her presumed self-esteem issues and make her work for his attention. Its a classic tactic of the so-called \"pickup artist\" movement, a misogynist subculture with a set of rules for picking up women or, as they style it, \"game\". There are gradients of how odious this is but the lighter elements ndash such as negging ndash are fairly mainstream.I wouldnt be drawn. I laughed, told him I was perfectly happy as I am.He was a relatively short man and not unattractive, obviously took care of his appearance and had a confidence bordering on bullish.\"Why are you here \" he asked me. \"Wouldnt you be happier at home in your kitchen with your children \" He wasnt trying to be a cheeky chappy. He wasnt trying to be a contrarian. He was, quite seriously, asking me the question.Two things kept me on the spot: an ingrained politeness and a desire to confound his beliefs by confronting him with a women who has neither children nor a kitchen anyone would want to pass much time in.\"I dont have children and I also dont want children,\" I told him. He seemed genuinely curious. \"Why not  \"\"Well,\" I said. \"Why would you assume I would \"He had the obvious answer: \"Women are only ever truly happy when they are at home with their children.\" Ah, there. The penny dropped. This guy was a pickup artist of the mens rights activism type.Mens rights activists espouse misogyny as ideology. They believe feminism has oppressed and disadvantaged men, they see no fundamental unfairness of societyrsquos treatment of women.They have hijacked feminist terminology and narrative for their own purposes and use the perceived evils of feminism to explain marital breakdown, romantic inadequacy and workplace failure.Id read so much about these fellows yet one never really believes one will cross paths in real le with the truly odious corners of the internet.Women should be at home in the kitchen with their children, not abroad at night in clubs. Yet who would he huntwe were safely at home  His stance was classic mens rights activism. It is a set of kaleidoscopically contradictory beliefs: that women should be sexually available to any man at any time that women should be despised as sluts that women should keep themselves exclusively for their husbands.Sorry chaps, as women have been told repeatedly, you canrsquot have it all.I wanted to stick around and see what  he had to say. He had much  to say.He point blank refused to entertain the notion that I might be happy being single. This was impossible. Women, he told me, are delusional about being single.\"The only reason you think youre happy being single,\" he said, and Ive had to edit this to take out certain suggestions for how he believed a man might benefit me, \"Is because youve never met a man who knows you, who is your intellectual equal, your emotional equal, who dominates you and who you can submit to.\"Women, he believes, look after themselves better - by which I imagine he means make themselves aesthetically pleasing for men - when they are in a relationship. Single women let themselves go.\"Thats why we have so many young women who are overweight. The rise of the single woman is causing obesity. Women are in their best shape when they are with the right man.\"Briefly, I mulled this over. I have put weight on while being single, thats right. But not due to unhappiness, due to contentment. No longer wanting to conform to a standard ideal of what my younger self believed men wanted was a great release. Besides the bald fact of this man being a dick, he was also a dick who had everything backward.He told me how hed been furious to receive a flyer through his door from a famous weight loss club and had gone as far as to phone up to complain about how the diet method the club uses messes with a womans hormones, forcing her into a weight loss weight gain cycle. Imagine that anger, that need for control.He carried on to tell me how damaged society has become by women who think they can raise children on their own as single mothers. \"People think the blurring of the gender roles is acceptable, its wrong. Men and womens roles should be separate but they need to work together - men providing and women at home.\"And so, you might think, this sounds not unlike being trapped next to an elderly and cantankerous uncle at an event organised by the side of the family youd usually ignore.But this is a relatively young man and these are his firmly held beliefs. The controlled hatred rolling from him was palpable.Receiving this information in a blunt and unemotional way was not easy. This has always been my tactic in a chat up situation. Present as disinterested. Do the rejecting before they reject you, save face at all costs. But this time it wasnt a tactic, I was quite determined to emphasise that I had no interest in him and this was not a chat up situation.Of course, I neednt have worried. How silly to have ever thought so. I was far too old for him. Despite him telling me he was mid s, there was no way this man would look at any woman upwards of .He told me about womens \"biological shelf le\" and how I was inching past it. \"A man,\" he said, \"Can father limitless children but a woman only ovulates  times a year and so she has a biological shelf le - thats a fact. It cant be disputed.\"I wonder how many women are aware of how many times a year they ovulate. This chap had clearly done his reading. I was reaching my limit now. I thought knowing his tricks and his trade I would be relatively immune but this bile was starting to have an impact as I thought of the other, younger women he might have tried it on and my other, younger self who might just have been susceptible.I know myself now, I know what I want and what I believe. But my late teens and my s were a quagmire of uncertainty, my self-esteem an unreliable flibbertigibbet. I would have tried to impress this man. I would have seen his views as a challenge, tried to win him round.And thats what pickup artists rely on, the vulnerability women in a non-feminist society develop by being constantly told they dont and cant fit an ideal of beauty, career success and motherhood.I was trying to tune back into the music, he was hearing the clattering din of misandry.He switched his phaser to our education system, a \"failed disgrace\". \"It is sucking the creativity out of our children,\" he said, as a gaggle of joyous young women squeezed past on their way to the bar, \"And teaching them conformity.\"Its teaching them homosexuality is ok, feminism is ok. The only reason we have feminists and lesbians is that the alpha man is dying out.\"There is no such thing as a lesbian - only a woman who hasnt found an alpha male to submit to.\"That was my limit. There was only so much talk of submission before I admitted defeat and just... walked away. I didnt chide him, I didnt shout at him.

But since the Murray wersquove come to know over the last few years has matured into a global statesman who uses his voice to promote equality ndash not least for women in sport - we can expect him to use his skills, experience and clout to create opportunities for others in the years to come.Itrsquos too early to speculate on exactly how he may do this, of course, but itrsquos surely the right time to address another related question doing the rounds over the weekend: how can we thank Andy Murray for the immense pride and joy he has given us Surely the most fitting way to honour this equality-minded sportsman would be the creation of a real and lasting legacy to grow and develop tennis in Scotland, allowing as many folk as possible to play and excel at the game. If you do this in the right manner, along the way you will inevitably unearth young talent. And, evenyou donrsquot create champions of Murrayrsquos stature, you at least end up with many more people playing sport, which in an overweight country like Scotland has got to be a good thing.All this leads only to more questions, of course. Since Murray has been at the top of tennis for more than a decade, why hasnrsquot it happened already  Why have no new public indoor courts been built in Scotland during his peak, despite many more folk being inspired to take up the game  And why has Scotland, despite punching well above its weight in terms of successreceived such little funding from the powers that be to capitalise on the Murray buzz Sadly, the authority that runs the sport in the UK, the Lawn Tennis Associationhas failed miserably so far to create any sort of tangible legacy for Murray, either in Scotland or the wider UK.Meanwhile, it has been left to his mother, Judy, the tennis coach and force of nature that single-handedly created the opportunities for her son and many other young Scots to excel at the game over the years, to fill the void.Through her many grassroots initiatives, Ms Murray tours the country week in, week out, offering taster sessions and training in as many communities as possible, including many of the most deprived. She wants every child in Scotland, regardless of background, to have the chance to play a sport that still has a reputation for snobbishness.Therersquos only so much Ms Murray can do on her own, of course, which led her to conceive the tennis centre near Dunblane, part of a wider sporting and leisure development, Park of Keir, that she views as a fitting legacy for the extraordinary success of both of her sons.Despite some local opposition and, it must be said, a woeful and frustrating lack of will and ambition in many others, her vision, which currently relies wholly on commercial activity, is finally moving forward, with building work expected to begin soon. Once open, the centre will offer accessible facilities and opportunities - including vital indoor courts - for whole families to develop a love of tennis. It will also train the next generation of coaches and professionals to take the game out to the community and develop opportunities for folk from every background to play, both for fun and competitively.Itrsquos a plan that deserves public money and one straightforward way to thank Murray for his huge contribution to national le would be for the LTA to provide some funds for the development, which will be run as a charitable trust I dont doubt that he will be contributing his skills and expertise in ious ways, both formally and informally, in the years to come.The LTA, which has benefitted financially from Murraymania over the years, is investing in a new national academy in conjunction with the University of Stirling, catering for UK-wide rising stars. Developing elite players is important. But grassroots bases such as the Murray centre are also deserving of funding, arguably more so, and itrsquos time for the LTA to cough up more generously.All the Murrays have shown time and time again that sheer drive, determination and belief can make things happen, and there are many spheres of Scottish le that could learn lessons from their ldquocan do approach, whether that be entrepreneurism or arts education.Right now, however, itrsquos time for the sporting authorities and politicians who have been falling over themselves to laud Andy Murray to back his legacy with hard cash and action rather than warm words.

But since the Murray wersquove come to know over the last few years has matured into a global statesman who uses his voice to promote equality ndash not least for women in sport - we can expect him to use his skills, experience and clout to create opportunities for others in the years to come.Itrsquos too early to speculate on exactly how he may do this, of course, but itrsquos surely the right time to address another related question doing the rounds over the weekend: how can we thank Andy Murray for the immense pride and joy he has given us Surely the most fitting way to honour this equality-minded sportsman would be the creation of a real and lasting legacy to grow and develop tennis in Scotland, allowing as many folk as possible to play and excel at the game. If you do this in the right manner, along the way you will inevitably unearth young talent. And, evenyou donrsquot create champions of Murrayrsquos stature, you at least end up with many more people playing sport, which in an overweight country like Scotland has got to be a good thing.All this leads only to more questions, of course. Since Murray has been at the top of tennis for more than a decade, why hasnrsquot it happened already  Why have no new public indoor courts been built in Scotland during his peak, despite many more folk being inspired to take up the game  And why has Scotland, despite punching well above its weight in terms of successreceived such little funding from the powers that be to capitalise on the Murray buzz Sadly, the authority that runs the sport in the UK, the Lawn Tennis Associationhas failed miserably so far to create any sort of tangible legacy for Murray, either in Scotland or the wider UK.Meanwhile, it has been left to his mother, Judy, the tennis coach and force of nature that single-handedly created the opportunities for her son and many other young Scots to excel at the game over the years, to fill the void.Through her many grassroots initiatives, Ms Murray tours the country week in, week out, offering taster sessions and training in as many communities as possible, including many of the most deprived. She wants every child in Scotland, regardless of background, to have the chance to play a sport that still has a reputation for snobbishness.Therersquos only so much Ms Murray can do on her own, of course, which led her to conceive the tennis centre near Dunblane, part of a wider sporting and leisure development, Park of Keir, that she views as a fitting legacy for the extraordinary success of both of her sons.Despite some local opposition and, it must be said, a woeful and frustrating lack of will and ambition in many others, her vision, which currently relies wholly on commercial activity, is finally moving forward, with building work expected to begin soon. Once open, the centre will offer accessible facilities and opportunities - including vital indoor courts - for whole families to develop a love of tennis. It will also train the next generation of coaches and professionals to take the game out to the community and develop opportunities for folk from every background to play, both for fun and competitively.Itrsquos a plan that deserves public money and one straightforward way to thank Murray for his huge contribution to national le would be for the LTA to provide some funds for the development, which will be run as a charitable trust I dont doubt that he will be contributing his skills and expertise in ious ways, both formally and informally, in the years to come.The LTA, which has benefitted financially from Murraymania over the years, is investing in a new national academy in conjunction with the University of Stirling, catering for UK-wide rising stars. Developing elite players is important. But grassroots bases such as the Murray centre are also deserving of funding, arguably more so, and itrsquos time for the LTA to cough up more generously.All the Murrays have shown time and time again that sheer drive, determination and belief can make things happen, and there are many spheres of Scottish le that could learn lessons from their ldquocan do approach, whether that be entrepreneurism or arts education.Right now, however, itrsquos time for the sporting authorities and politicians who have been falling over themselves to laud Andy Murray to back his legacy with hard cash and action rather than warm words.

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The next two weeks could be the most important for the future of our country in the st Century. Yes, that is a big claim, and it is only the beginning of , but the vote on Theresa May#s Withdrawal Agreement and the response she gives a week today, as she must, is likely to determine the continued existence of the UK, the laws it operates under and how we behave as a society. If the Prime Minister plays it badly, and in particular makes gets her response wrong the traditional acceptance of evolutionary social and economic change may perish in bonfires, demonstrations and mutual mistrust in all politicians and the democracy we cherish. This may seem alarmist, but let me be plain – such are the forces manoeuvring to usurp our democracy that faith in our institutions may simply evaporate and be replaced with a far less pleasant belief that direct action is what will bring results.I work internationally and spend my time more or less equally between Edinburgh, London, France and Ireland. I can see what is happening around me in the EU and in the UK – and in the last six months all of us, the whole continent, have begun a descent into mayhem and anarchy. From my own experience this new mood is not to be welcomed, nor is it especially the responsibility of Theresa May or her government, even though we might blame herwe rely for our outlook on reading only UK media sources.The EU negotiators have sought from the outset to demonstrate to countries that might warm to the UK’s independence of thought that leaving or loosening ties with the EU should not be considered. I am thinking of Greece, Italy and even France. Yes, France! Who can deny that France, unlike the UK or especially Scotland, is not at the heart of the EU  Yet I can attest that the mood in France is at breaking-point it is played down by the British media, especially the broadcasters, but it is developing into an alarmingly chaotic and violent phase the likes of which has not been seen since  when the fth republic nearly fell and de Gaulle had ultimately to resign. The Gilet Jaunes or Yellow Vest protests against President Macron have not subsided, not been bought off – they are growing and arriving in many cities beyond Paris, such as Bordeaux and Rouen, in massive numbers and requiring tear gas and heavy handed responses that we would think shocking were they to happen here in the UK. These demonstrations are multaceted in their grievances – and are neither left-wing or right-wing, although they contain extremes from both wings – but they do raise what might be called populist concerns about double standards in the application or acceptance of open immigration, justice, public taxes and spending – or the growing gulf between those who do well out of the current system and those who lose by it. Yet France is no longer alone, the Gilet Jaunes protest are now erupting in other countries, and there have been a few copy-cat instances in London – but there are now calls across the political spectrum for it to become a physical presence in UK political dialogue. I say to all readers this is not a road anyone should wish to go down or support unless they believe brute force trumps reason and debate.I have driven through the barricades and intimidation that comes at the hands of such demonstrations and it is fearsome, alarming and costly. This is what our parliamentarians are on the verge of ushering in across the UK. By refusing now to accept that the people voted, deal or no deal, in  to leave the European Union – in the largest-ever UK demonstration of democratic instruction – and that in turn those same MPs agreed by a huge majority to invoke Article  to deliver that result, all faith in our democratic institutions is being lost. It is not dficult to imagine – with France as an example – of where we are heading.When MPs call the electorate stupid, dumb, racist and bigoted for voting against the establishment they invite a response that may lack subtlety but is a direct reflection of their own abandonment of humility. The arrogance and hypocrisy of so many remainer MPs reeks like the rotting fish they would preserve through the EU’s fisheries discard policy. Changing parliamentary procedure is the latest debasement of the British playing by the rules.Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement must be voted down – for even beyond the unecessary “backstop” it is worse than being a fully paid-up member of the EU – where the UK’s unity is not put at risk and we at least would have a modicum of influence about our future. How May then responds is crucial. As the law stands we must leave on  March and adopt the world-wide conventions of WTO rules. It is a deal with everyone and we can then move on to establish better outcomes. To instead repeatedly betray promises and overturn the referendum result will no doubt bring on mass demonstrations in the disguise of Gilet Jaunes, infiltrated I expect by anarchists looking for a fight, the extremes of left and right and a hydra-headed unaccountable extra-parliamentary leadership that cannot easily be tamed.Our MPs must vote down the “deal” that is not a deal and then move to leave on  March. Anything less will see the repudiation of our democracy end peaceful change as we have known it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4855880.1547410349!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotsman leader nicola sturgeon is right to call in watchdog in order to restore trust","story":"Nicola Sturgeon#s decision, yesterday, to refer herself to a standards  over her actions during an investigation into complaints made against Alex Salmond was the correct one, though we are bound to say the First Minister should have taken this step sooner.When it emerged last year that two women had levelled allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Salmond, Ms Sturgeon was quick to insist they should be treated fairly and with compassion. Regardless of her own professional or personal relationship with the man she succeeded as both First Minister and SNP leader, it was important these women were heard.Ms Sturgeon’s strong words have since been seriously undermined thanks to the actions of the Scottish Civil Service and her own questionable judgement.Mr Salmond’s victory at the Court of Session which ruled, last week, that the Scottish Government investigation into complaints against him has not been executed lawfully was a disaster not only for Ms Sturgeon but for the two civil servants who made formal complaints against the former First Minister. Those women have been badly let down by a flawed process.But while supporters of Ms Sturgeon may, legitimately, apportion blame for this appalling development to the civil service, they cannot do so when it comes to a series of meetings between the First Minister and Mr Salmond at which the matter was discussed.Ms Sturgeon is adamant she informed Mr Salmond she would not intervene in the investigation but questions remain over why she felt it appropriate to meet with him.Given the sensitivity, her decision to meet Mr Salmond in private was, at best, a serious error. That she held two more meetings with him and discussed the matter in two subsequent phone calls beggars belief.We now know Ms Sturgeon’s chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, attended the first of those meetings. That Ms Sturgeon only confirmed this after questioning at Holyrood, only adds weight to the suggestion the First Minister hasn’t been entirely candid during this process.The investigation into her role should be detailed and wide-ranging. Simply, we must get to the bottom of what happenedtrust in the system is to be restored.

It is what business leaders across Scotland have been calling for.“It also avoids the kind of chaos and confusion nationalists crave because they believe it would strengthen their demand for a second independence referendum. “The Scottish Secretary added: “I do not claim it is perfect - but it does achieve key objectives.”He warnedthe deal is defeated in the Commons on Tuesday, the UK could leave the European Union without any deal in place - or risk Brexit not going ahead which would “fail to respect” the  referendum,“If we do not back this deal, in just  days’ time the UK risks crashing out of the EU without a deal,” Mr Mundell argued.“Or we could be drting towards a situation where we fail to respect the referendum result to deliver Brexit.“Those are the real alternatives to leaving with the Prime Minister’s deal.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday. A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal. You really feel like a star in the way that they treat you.”No stranger to competition, John is a three-time winner of our own Best of the West contest, but he insists he is not overly concerned about a victory on this occasion. However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This playground is a major attraction for families and children, not only from Balmoral but indeed much further afield, as it is part of the fantastic natural resource that is the Lagan Valley Regional Park.“The playground will be closed for around three months whilst the site is levelled and landscaped and a range of new equipment is installed.”Cllr McAteer said the refurbishment will ensure that the play park will be inclusive of children who have disabilities.“New equipment includes a roundabout which is wheelchair friendly, sit-in rockers for small children with disabilities and basket sit-in swings for more senior children as well as slides and climbing frames which have transfer stations which will be wheelchair friendly.”“It’s a wonderful design and Council staff have done a great job in bringing the project to shovel ready stage. Weather permitting, it should be in great shape and opened for the spring.”The new-look playground will also benefit from new safety features including a new three metre pedestrian crossing to the playground, finished in tactile paving and new anti-vandal park benches.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37708745.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/Theresa_May.jpg","title":"dup rejects meaningless assurances from eu on brexit backstop dodds calls for real changes to withdrawal agreement","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nothing has changed.\"The North Belfast MP said the letters bolstered the parties concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop still stands, there has been no change to the withdrawal agreement and that Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels.Instead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the withdrawal agreement.DUP MP Nigel DoddsFacebookTwitterRegarding the Prime Minister’s comment about “changes to everyday le in Northern Ireland that would put the future of our Union at risk” Mr Dodds said: “The Prime Minister must explain this comment. What exactly would the Government be changing \"If this is nothing more than scaremongering, then the Prime Minister should cease from such foolish talk.

You can take no deal off the table by voting for that deal.\"If no deal is as bad as you believe it is, it will be the height of recklessness to do anything .\"The Prime Minister said she had listened to the concerns of MPs, including the DUP, who currently prop up the Conservative government.She said the letter from the EU contained \"valuable new clarications and assurances to put before the House of Commons, including on getting our future relationship in place rapidly so the backstop should never need to be used\".She added: \"We now have a commitment from the EU that work on our new relationship can begin as soon as possible after the signing of the Withdrawal Agreement in advance of March , and we have an explicit commitment that this new relationship does not need to replicate the backstop in any respect whatsoever.\"Mrs May said the EU had agreed to a \"fast track process\" to agree a new trade deal with the UK after Brexit, and that this made it more likely the backstop will never have to be used.A restored Stormont would also have a say on any new EU rules that are added to the backstop.Answering questions from journalists, Mrs May said: \"You talk about Parliament taking control. What I think is important is that we deliver on the result of the referendum.\"What Im concerned about from what we have seen, as Ive said in my speech, over the last few days is the real prospect that we could see a, sort of, stymie in Parliament, or Parliament operating, or people in Parliament trying to operate in a way, that frustrates Brexit.\"We have a duty to deliver Brexit and thats what I and the Government want to do, and it is what we are going to do.\"I want MPs to recognise that as well.\""},{"url":null,"title":"book reveals number of catholics in dup and uup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane.

They described the last week as an “ordeal”, and have asked to meet the officers involved in the operation in a bid for answers.“The close and extended families of Dr Deirdre Donnelly O’Flaherty wish to express their heartfelt gratitude for the many kind and thoughtful messages of support which they have received over the course of what has been a tumultuous and distressing week leading up to the th anniversary of Deirdre’s disappearance on the th of January , ” they stated.“The families are relieved only because this ordeal is over although in our view, the outcome was not in doubt.“Notication that Gardai were going to carry out a land search for Deirdre was entirely unexpected, not least given that the finding by Order of Judge Deeney at Belfast High Court on the th of January  that Deirdre had ‘gone into the water and drowned’ was supported by the oral evidence of the investigating Garda Sergeant.“As far as the families are aware there has not in fact been any ongoing search for Deirdre since at least that time.“The families had only three days’ advance notice of the Gardai excavations near Milford, County Donegal and therefore had little time to prepare for the consequences of the very public, national exposure of this story during the week.“Gardai confirmed to the families at that time that the decision to conduct the excavation in a remote area over fty miles from her last known whereabouts flowed from an anonymous note handed in to a Garda station in County Monaghan in August . This note apparently provided precise map co-ordinates for the location of Deirdre’s remains. “The families have not seen this note and this information was not made public due to the ongoing nature of the investigation. In their Press Release yesterday Gardai stated that they had ‘found nothing to further the search’.“Accordingly, the families have requested a meeting with the Gardai investigation team to discuss a number of questions relating to the conduct, conclusions and consequences of this investigation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new teachers in northern ireland worst paid in uk and republic claim unions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While % of the increase in the value of housing stock last year came from house price increases, the remaining % - or £.bn - was due to new homes being built. Savills said this is the highest proportion contributed by new housing development since  and reflects the Government focus on building more new homes. Within the £. trillion total, the collective value of the private rented sector topped £. trillion for the first time.

It can propose legislation for government to take forward  it can amend or block it but back bench MPs cannot take over conducting a complex international negotiation— Sarah Wollaston MPJanuary , However, the Liaison Committee chairwoman, Tory Sarah Wollaston, said it had not been discussed with other members and that backbenchers constitutionally “cannot take over conducting a complex international negotiation”.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, criticised “complicated jiggery-pokery” by MPs, warning they were “really playing with fire”.He told LBC: “I think that people will feel betrayed.“And I think they will feel that there has been a great conspiracy by the deep state of the UK, the people who really run the country.”With less than  hours to go until the long-awaited vote, Mrs May will say, based on last week’s Westminster drama, that she now believes MPs blocking Brexit is a more likely outcome than leaving without a deal.Speaker John Bercow sparked uproar in the Commons last week after he selected an amendment from Tory former minister Dominic Grieve which attempts to speed up the process for the Government to reveal what it will do nextthe PM’s Brexit deal is rejected.Peoples faith in the democratic process and their politicians would suffer catastrophic harmTheresa MayFacebookTwitterMrs May is expected to tell factory workers in pro-Leave Stoke-on-Trent on Monday: “Imaginean anti-devolution House of Commons had said to the people of Scotland or Wales that despite voting in favour of a devolved legislature, Parliament knew better and would overrule them.

This is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union.”But former attorney general Dominic Grieve disagreed, telling the same programme: “It will lead to the break-up of the UK for starters. That seems to me to be a pretty clear indication of a form of national suicide.”"},{"url":null,"title":"search for red volkswagen van after 15yearold","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

India’s cities are among the world’s smoggiest and it is just starting to tackle the problem.The Indian government has announced a five-year programme to cut air pollution by up to % from  levels in the country’s  worst-affected cities.Key targets include reducing the burning of field waste, firewood and charcoal, cleaning up thermal power and car emissions and heavily polluting brick production, as well as controlling dust from construction.Critics say the plan lacks details on enforcement and funding."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxN1xcXC8wOFxcXC8wOTEwMDI0MVxcXC9TY3JlZW4tc2hvdC0yMDE3LTA4LTA5LWF0LTEwLjAyLjE1LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5kZXJyeW5vdy5jb21cXFwvYXNzZXRzXFxcL2lcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nP3Y9MVwifSIsImhhc2giOiIzYzBiOWUzZjYyNjk3ODg3MGFhN2U5NGIyNTU4OGUzZWM3ZTBkMDAyIn0=/screen-shot-2017-08-09-at-10-02-15.png","title":"major refurbishment work carried homes brandywell area derry","story":"Major refurbishment work is set to be carried out on homes in the Brandywell area of Derry.Sinn Féin Councillor Patricia Logue has welcomed an information meeting that was held in the Gasyard with residents of Bluebell Hill Gardens and the Housing Executive to discuss a major refurbishment scheme to be carried out in their homes.Councillor Logue said “For years now these residents have experienced a range of issues with their homes such as dampness and plaster falling off walls.\"They were advised that the long awaited essential work is to begin on their homes hopefully by the end September.\"The work includes plastering and insulation outside of homes, new windows, doors and roofing work.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe timeline for the rest of the work is as follows:New kitchens - October External maintenance scheme – April Heating – August \"I am trying to get the installation of kitchens brought forward as residents have waited a very long time for these issues to be addressed,\" Cllr Logue said.\"To complement the work on the houses I have also been in contact with Transport NI to have the roadway in the street and footpaths renewed.\"If any resident has questions on the work they should feel free to contact me.\""},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxN1xcXC8xMlxcXC8wNTE0NTYyNlxcXC9TY3JlZW4tc2hvdC0yMDE3LTEyLTA1LWF0LTE0LjU2LjA0LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5kZXJyeW5vdy5jb21cXFwvYXNzZXRzXFxcL2lcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nP3Y9MVwifSIsImhhc2giOiJlZWU0N2UwN2U0OGU4ODlmY2IyZjM4MmI5NmM0OGUwNTI2ZDBhM2IyIn0=/screen-shot-2017-12-05-at-14-56-04.png","title":"meeting held discuss delays major brandywell refurbishment scheme","story":"Sinn Féin Foyle MP Elisha McCallion has secured a meeting with Housing Executives and residents to discuss continued delays to a major refurbishment scheme for Bluebell Hill Gardens in the Brandywell area of the city.The Foyle MP said: \"I was extremely disappointed to learn that the scheme to improve homes in Bluebell Hill Gardens that are currently in an acceptable living standard will be delayed yet again until the New Year as far as March.\"This is unacceptable and I and my colleague Patricia Logue have demanded that senior officials from the Housing Executive come to the Brandywell and explain to you their failings in delivering this work.\"The Housing Executive has said that there are more remedial works that must be carried out than first envisaged.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers.

We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

It currently carries out around , cremations each year.The proposed larger facility would increase capacity, allowing around , cremations to take place annually.As part of the council’s plans, the existing crematorium would close, with the building being “re-used” for other purposes.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said the proposals are based on increasing demand for cremation services, but couldn’t say when it hopes to have the new facility operational.Stressing that the plans are “at initial stages”, she said the final project designs will have to be submitted to Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council – the local authority for the area – for planning approval.“Belfast City Council’s proposals are based on an economic assessment which shows that demand for cremation will continue to rise year on year and by  is expected to have reached ,. Roselawn is currently carrying out about , cremations annually,” the spokesperson said.“The proposed development is for a new two-chapel crematoriumwith the re-use of the existing crematorium building.“Our replacement plans are at an initial stage. We are currently working to appoint an integrated design team and crematorium specialist so it is too early to specy a timeline.”It is understood the existing crematorium has listed status, meaning the council is restricted in terms of making any external changes, extending the building or redeveloping the site.The operating hours of the service were extended in  in response to increased demand, according to the council. But the spokesperson insisted that the current three-day wait for a cremation slot is “chiefly dictated by the administrative process” and “has not increased over the years”. She added that “there are available cremation slots in the crematorium on most days”.Last year, members of the city council’s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee agreed to set aside a maximum of £ million for the proposed new crematorium development, pending further work on the design and access.Tributes paid after two men killed in mountain falls joins Nigel Creeand Robert Maxwellat the location of the planned fishing retreat.

If this is the first time you have subscribed to emails from JPIMedia Ltd, the publishers of Belfast Newsletter, please check your inbox to very your email address.  .html.valA public consultation on the future of education in Lurgan is being launched today- with simultaneous meetings to take place at .pm in Lurgan Junior High School and the Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High.The meetings will discuss the future of the Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High.According to documentation received by the Lurgan Mail, there will only be one option up for discussion - the closure of the Lurgan campus with children being bussed to the Portadown campus.It has also been claimed the consultation is simply a ‘box ticking exercise’.Lobby group Education Equality for Lurgan said: “Once the consultations begin it is important Lurgan parents step up their game on this issue. “We come to tonight’s meeting without sight of the consultation document which is shocking, yet Portadown and Tandragee parents will have had a day to review the consultation document before their meeting. “This shows how much contempt the EA has for the Lurgan community. Once we get sight of the papers it will be handed straight into the hands of our legal team for further guidance on what our options are going forward. “We will play our part but we can’t do it without you the community this is a challenge we need to meet head on together. So please turn out in numbers at either of the meetings in Lurgan this evening.“Tonight is the night the Education Authority begin their box ticking exercise. And be under no illusion as far as they are concerned that is all this process will be to them unless the community rise up against a predetermined outcome that was decided back in . “In  the EA legal team put a temporary halt on the full closure of Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High School due to process not being followed. Two years on and we are about to enter a public consultation process with a predetermined outcome that will be so stacked against any possibility of Lurgan retaining a Senior High School that it may well have come straight from the Chairman Mao handbook of asserting control of pre-determined outcomes. “We already know Portadown and Tandragee parents will be consulted during this process to determine whether or not to close a school in Lurgan this in itself tells you how much the outcome has been stacked against Lurgan children with the EA hopeful they have the number to influence the outcome. “The Education Authority told EEL last year their preferred optionwhich will undoubtedly have been their starting point for their paper that will be put to you. An honest and open process would not begin with the answer and working backwards with the questions. “We are in no doubt there will be smoke and mirrors, many half truths and some downright lies come out through this consultation process, but we urge you the community do not let these people take us for the fools they obviously believe we are.

We have known for years the Dickson Plan is not an education pathway the Education Authority are happy to support with numerous EA reports highlighting this position. So to destroy the Dickson Plan by removing that pathway in Lurgan through slight of hand would be a perfect outcome for them.”Presenting their alternative they said: “There is currently a proposal put forward which we have already heard from certain quartersis not within the Dickson Plan, which is simply . “It is an - High School on the Toberhewny site retaining Academic selection at  .”They added: “We believe this to be the only real alternative option for Lurgan and you can see clearly why. That is not to say we are against another Lurgan option should one materialise we just don’t believe after spending the last two years looking at the options that there is another alternative, but we are happy to listen to other options should anyone put one forward. As yet we haven’t heard any other options from any group or party for a Lurgan solution that ticks all the boxes.“Please do not allow this to pass without having your say.

Picture by Arthur Allison Pacemaker.Robert Maxwell from Clough and his friend Nigel Cree from Seaforde are two ex-servicemen involved in Let’s Do, a charity which aims to aid physically and mentally injured veteran’s rehabilitation through outdoor group events.The UK-wide charity is most active in the Isle of Man, but the Clough pair want to add to the charity’s outdoor assets in Northern Ireland.They are in the process of setting up a fishing retreat at Kennedy’s Bog – located by farmland owned by Robert’s father – which they hope will be ready by the summer. Nigel said: “What we’ve decided to do is turn it into a fishery that the charity can use to let veterans fish and relax a bit. We’ve also got the Mournes right beside us so that’s another outdoor activity they can do while they’re here.Our reporter gets some fishing tip from ex-serviceman Nigel Cree. Picture by Arthur Allison Pacemaker.“This is our baby. There’s projects where in the UK but we want to have something to offer in Northern Ireland for veterans here or from where in the UK to come over.”Robert said: “To start off we cleaned the lake out – you were getting four to five foot of water and then five to six foot of pure sludge.“Then Nigel and I built a bridge over the lake. Next we’ll be building two fishing stands.”The bridge and two fishing stands are to be named after servicemen who died during the Troubles, or later as a result of injuries suffered during the conflict.Of the river’s fishing potential, Nigel said: “Originally there were rudd in it. The ministrygave us some more rudd, perch and tench. They put about  in plus there would already have been a natural head of . We have a decent head of fish in there.” A keen fisherman himself, Nigel added: “I think anything which helps people relax and they’re in good company has got to be of benefit.“The activity is what we can offer to get them out of the house, but it’s really about the company.”Log burners and house coal to be banned in fight against air pollution Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Robert said: “We could be facilitating over  veterans in a year easily. Who we’re aiming for are guys who are either mentally or physically disabled.”Robert’s Army career ended as a result of the injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident in .He lost an arm in the hit and run crash and he also suffered head injuries and nerve damage. Since then Robert has suffered from PTSD .He said: “I was in a bad way – physically and mentally. You can fix the body but the mind isn’t as easy to repair. PTSD never really goes away.“Through our charity we’re treating disabled veterans like ordinary iniduals and not patronising them.“We can’t offer financial support but we can offer peer support.”After his accident Robert volunteered in a pastoral care role offering support to injured military veterans.This led to the the development of Let’s Do veteran’s support charity, set up in .Let’s Do is a veteran run charity which has helped people overcome disabilities since .The main aim of the charity is to help ex-servicemen and women to come to terms with injuries and disabilities – such as amputees, those with limited vision, partial paralysis and PTSD – through outdoor activities that will encourage them to become involved and help them to grow confidence whilst becoming comfortable with their disabilities.For more information see www.letsdoevents.infoWhen Robert’s marriage fell apart, his we stayed in the family home while Robert moved into a wooden cabin on his father’s farm.Robert wants the cabin to form phase two of the fishing project by renovating it to allow fellow veterans to stay over for respite.Nigel commented: “Through the course of our work we learn about people who have chosen a le of isolation because of PTSD and injuries suffered during their service.“For instance we’ve learnt about a guy who is so depressed that he hasn’t left the house in eight years. He used to fish. I’m hoping we can use that to get him out of the house.“There are people out there who feel abandoned. Largely men. Quite a lot have been in a family, their marriage has collapsed, they live in isolation.”Robert added: “Big military charities generate lots of money, but they’ve become corporate and ex-servicemen who need help most are falling through the cracks.“It’s the guys who we know about who are being ignored because they’re not high profile enough, there’s no publicity mileage in them.“Funding for our charity is very ad hoc. In fishing terms we’re the minnows.“We don’t have a great deal of budget and volunteers, but those who are involved work extremely hard.”Asked , considering the trauma he has suffered, he still would have signed up to join the army, Robert said: “Yes, my biggest regret is not being able to achieve more in the service. I can see why there is recruiting issues now when you look at the way the veterans are being treated.”try catch  TrendingMourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsTragedy: Two men die in separate Mourne Mountains fallsPSNI appeal for parents to know where your children are - after -year-old rushed to AE with vodka intoxicationGlenn Irwin: I want record six wins at this years North West Log burners and house coal to be banned in fight against air pollution          ..

She is well aware that unionists – and not just the DUP – are worried about the precise legal constitutional status of the ‘backstop’ and that’s because it is cloaked in uncertainty. On Friday she had the chance to address those worries in an interview with the BBC’s Mark Devenport. She also had a chance to address them earlier in the week when the issue was raised at Cabinet.Karen Bradley ignored the chance to give any reassurance to unionistsBut here’s what she said in her interview to Mark: “I do know what my obligations are under the Belfast Good Friday agreement with regards to the principle of consent and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their future and their constitutional status and I’m aware of those obligations as secretary of state.” Not one word, not one single word of reassurance to unionists. Not one sentence, let alone a paragraph to let them know that their worries were unnecessary. Just a threat to the DUP:you don’t vote for the Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday – evenit still contains the backstop – then don’t be surprisedI may have to consider the possibility of a border poll fairly soon. It was a stupid thing to say in the circumstances. More worryingly, she was being deliberately provocative. She knew exactly what she was saying and how it would be interpreted.The power to call a border poll does lie with the secretary of state, although it would never be exercised without the authority of the prime minister and Cabinet. Here’s the relevant passage from the  Act: ‘The Secretary of State may by order direct the holding of a poll for the purposes of section  on a date specied in the order. Subject to paragraph , the Secretary of State shall exercise the power...at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.’The key word in all of this is ‘likely.’ It’s a very loose, open to all sorts of interpretation word . A secretary of state could, for example, argue that, a unionists no longer have a majority in the Assembly b in the last few elections unionistshave not polled an overall majority of the votes cast c recent opinion polls suggest that a particular Brexit deal, or no deal at all, would increase support for Irish unity. On that evidence alone a secretary of state could make a reasonable case thatthere was a border poll it ‘might well happen’ that the pro-Union side would lose. The issue has been discussed in previous Cabinets and all of these points will have been made. Mrs Bradley didn’t couldn’t deny that the issue of a border poll was raised again at Tuesday’s cabinet. Whatever one thinks of Theresa May – and I’m no fan – she does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who oversaw the unravelling of the United Kingdom. Her concern – and every prime minister’s concerns are focused on the ‘national interest’ – is that a no deal or ‘hard’ deal increases the pressure for a border poll. And while it seems likely to me that such a poll would see a win for the pro-Union side, nothing can be taken for granted. Karen Bradley will not have made the unilateral decision to raise the issue of a border poll. She was told to do so by the prime minister: and Mrs Bradley is the sort of politician who will always do what she is told. The trouble is, once that particular card has been played it is very dficultto remove it from the table.But, as I’ve already said, threatening the DUP is probably not the wisest thing to do at this point . Mind you, I think the DUP weakened its own hand by saying that it would probably vote for Mrs May in a vote of no confidence, evenshe fails to get through a Withdrawal Agreement which still includes the backstop. How many times does she have to ‘betray’them before they turn on her The DUP believes that the backstop undermines the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. That’s a fair point to make, given the fact that there is very little clarity about its duration, or when and how it can be abandoned. The latest calculation the DUP has to make is how serious the prime minister – or her potential successor, either Conservative or Labour – is about a border poll. Given the upending of local dynamics caused by Brexit I think it would be an extraordinarily ‘courageous’ prime minister or taoiseachwho would decide to call a border poll amidst the present chaos.That said, we are reaching the end of the poker game and all hands will have to be revealed fairly shortly. The DUP’s is not as strong as it needs to be at this point and Leo Varadkar has overplayed his. But there’s still everything to play for. The key player, of course, remains the House of Commons and I still suspect that Parliamentary sovereigntywill, in the end, come down in favour of a very soft landing.Swire amendment will not reassure DUP or Brexiteers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingFirst pictures: Two killed in separate Mournes fallsMourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsTragedy: Two men die in separate Mourne Mountains fallsGlenn Irwin: I want record six wins at this years North West PSNI appeal for parents to know where your children are - after -year-old rushed to AE with vodka intoxication          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The number of children requiring a place at the school has grown year on year and has now reached .\"Adaptations have been made to increase classroom space at the school, however despite this projections indicate that by  there would be around  pupils requiring a place and the school would not have sufficient capacity to meet this demand unless additional capital investment is made to increase capacity. It is proposed that funding is allocated for the expansion of additional learning needs places for Ysgol y Deri to ensure sufficient places are available to meet the demand.\"It was confirmed in a council meeting that pound, will be allocated for the expansion and there will also be pound, allocated to primary provision in Penarth.Work on other projects that form part of the funding programme are already well under way as part of a major commitment to improving educational facilities that will make a dference to thousands of children across the Vale.Cllr Bob Penrose, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for Learning and Culture, said: ldquoThis increased funding should allow us to further expand what was already a far-reaching programme of investment aimed at transforming nursery, primary, secondary and faith education across the Vale.ldquoThe countyrsquos most vulnerable pupils will receive greater provision as more money has been allocated to both Ysgol y Deri and the Centre for Learning and Wellbeing.ldquoThe st Century Schools investment programme will make a signicant dference to the educational experience of children throughout the county.ldquoExtensive improvements have already been made to a host of school buildings and that is set to continue on an even greater scale in this latest round of investment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Andno-deal is as bad as you believe it is, it would be the height of recklessness to do anything .But she said that recent events meant a no-deal Brexit was less likely than ldquoa paralysis in Parliament that risks there## being no Brexit.Warning that failure to deliver Brexit would do ldquocatastrophic harm to trust in the political process, Mrs May said: ldquoWe all have a duty to implement the result of the referendum.Under our constitution, Parliament can either change the governmentrsquos mind or change the government. It can propose legislation for government to take forward  it can amend or block it but back bench MPs cannot take over conducting a complex international negotiationmdash Sarah Wollaston MPJanuary , She was speaking as Conservative former ministers Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan put forward a plan to give Parliament control over the Brexit processMrs May loses Tuesdayrsquos vote.Their European Union Withdrawal Number  Bill would give the Government three weeks to seek a compromise that can get through the Commons and allow the UK to leave the EU on March  as planned.If that failed, the Liaison Committee, made up of senior backbench MPs who chair Commons committees, would be given the job of coming up with its own compromise deal.If that deal was approved by the Commons, the Government would be ldquolegally required to implement it.However, Liaison Committee chairman Sarah Wollaston poured cold water on the proposal, saying backbenchers constitutionally ldquocannot take over conducting a complex international negotiation.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, meanwhile, criticised ldquocomplicated jiggery-pokery by MPs, warning they were ldquoreally playing with fire.He told LBC: ldquoI think that people will feel betrayed.ldquoAnd I think they will feel that there has been a great conspiracy by the deep state of the UK, the people who really run the country.Meanwhile, the chairman of the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, Andrew Murrison, tabled an amendment to the Brexit motion to create a ldquosunset clause preventing the backstop extending beyond the end of .International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned that failure to deliver Brexit would be ldquoa disaster from which we might not recover.He told the Today programme that while no-deal Brexit would damage the economy it was better than staying, adding: ldquoI donrsquot regard no-deal as national suicide.ldquoThis is not Dunkirk, this is leaving the European Union.But former attorney general Dominic Grieve disagreed, telling the same programme: ldquoIt will lead to the break-up of the UK for starters.

Once we get sight of the papers it will be handed straight into the hands of our legal team for further guidance on what our options are going forward. “We will play our part but we can’t do it without you the community this is a challenge we need to meet head on together. So please turn out in numbers at either of the meetings in Lurgan this evening.“Tonight is the night the Education Authority begin their box ticking exercise. And be under no illusion as far as they are concerned that is all this process will be to them unless the community rise up against a predetermined outcome that was decided back in . “In  the EA legal team put a temporary halt on the full closure of Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High School due to process not being followed. Two years on and we are about to enter a public consultation process with a predetermined outcome that will be so stacked against any possibility of Lurgan retaining a Senior High School that it may well have come straight from the Chairman Mao handbook of asserting control of pre-determined outcomes. “We already know Portadown and Tandragee parents will be consulted during this process to determine whether or not to close a school in Lurgan this in itself tells you how much the outcome has been stacked against Lurgan children with the EA hopeful they have the number to influence the outcome. “The Education Authority told EEL last year their preferred optionwhich will undoubtedly have been their starting point for their paper that will be put to you. An honest and open process would not begin with the answer and working backwards with the questions. “We are in no doubt there will be smoke and mirrors, many half truths and some downright lies come out through this consultation process, but we urge you the community do not let these people take us for the fools they obviously believe we are.

We have known for years the Dickson Plan is not an education pathway the Education Authority are happy to support with numerous EA reports highlighting this position. So to destroy the Dickson Plan by removing that pathway in Lurgan through slight of hand would be a perfect outcome for them.”Presenting their alternative they said: “There is currently a proposal put forward which we have already heard from certain quartersis not within the Dickson Plan, which is simply . “It is an - High School on the Toberhewny site retaining Academic selection at  .”They added: “We believe this to be the only real alternative option for Lurgan and you can see clearly why. That is not to say we are against another Lurgan option should one materialise we just don’t believe after spending the last two years looking at the options that there is another alternative, but we are happy to listen to other options should anyone put one forward.

Though he had asthma from birth, Tiernan didn’t appear to suffer any attacks until he was aged . While he used the blue Ventolin inhaler, he never used the brown one, which is a steroid, according to his dad Stephen. When Tiernan came to his mum and dad’s room for help that morning, they tried everything to help him but he was gone within  minutes.Tiernan GreenHis tragic passing plunged Lurgan into shock and grief as many of his friends and school mates struggled to come to terms with the death of such a young and energeticman.However, his parents and brother and sister felt the unimaginable pain of his loss most deeply.Mum Donna admits to struggling to deal with the loss of her ’” handsome young son.Donna said: “As the second anniversary approaches of the death of my darling son Tiernan, it really just seems like yesterday.The Green family Tiernan with Mum Donna with youngest son Ryan Dad Stephen , Mise and Stefan“No mother or father should have to lay their child to rest.It should be the other way about.“Over these two years I have seen my family change and, when I say this, I mean we all have changed as people.I can honestly say our lives will never be the same again! “It’s weird how grief works on the mind.

My husband attends a meeting called Anam Cara and he finds it helps! “I find with me doing all my own asthma awareness and speaking out at dferent events- this, for me, ismy therapy this is what helps me -a mother who has lost her child.“We, as a family, lean off each other through the grief.“When I see my daughter is having a bad day I will speak to her and say THIS is ok. You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to have your quiet days when you don’t talk that much.“I know this is grief because I see it myself. I am the one who witnesses it. I am here for my family and they are here for me so we are all in this together.“I will still continue to raise as much awareness as possible and try and save as many lives as I can. I don’t want any other family to go through what we have.“As long as I am living my son’s name will always live on through others,” said Donna.The familyhas raised around £, for ious charitiessince Tiernan passed away.The first year the family raised funds for Craigavon area hospital buying a special machine for respiratory help costing more than £k.They also raised cash to renovate the Family Room at the hospital with Tiernan’s plaque and new furniture and a TV.Last year they raised money for Anam Cara - a counselling service for families suffering from grief.Stephen attends Anam Cara regularly and it has helped him deal with the intense grief he felt at the loss of his son. Indeed he has become so close to the group that the organisation has asked him to become a spokesperson for them.Donna has dealt with her grief by raising the profile of asthma and campaigning for greater awareness on how to treat the illness so other families don’t have to go through a similar dreadful tragedy.“I have been getting messages from people across the country, thanking me for helping to save their son’s le or even thank you for saving my own le.It’s unreal.“It has brought me great comfort knowing that I have helped,” she said.The family also have organised a truck run over the past two years and are planning another this May. It has raised thousands of pounds.However, on this second anniversary, the Green family will remain close to each other, helping each other deal with the loss of such a beloved son and brother.If you would like more support and information on Asthma, please check out the websitewww.asthma.org.uk get-involved campaigns government northern-ireland If you need help with grief you can contact Anam Cara via their website www.anamcara.ietry catch  TrendingNew principal appointed at Carrickfergus Grammar SchoolFinbarr was a shining example of how to bear a disabilityIN PICTURES: Take a trip down memory lane with the Times archivePhotographer found guilty of voyeurismTeen driver was doing mph          ..

How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
