Essentially this case is going to take up the rest of this year and if it takes up the rest of this year, that\u0027s the whole of his mother\u0027s Platinum Jubilee.\u0027The only thing he could have done to stop this getting worse is to have pulled the case and stopped it in some way so there was no alternative news.

You want a jury trial? I want a jury trial. You want to bring these claims? Well, in that case, you have to prove everything that you\u0027re saying, because I\u0027m not going to admit to anything\u0027.\u0027He added the case could still settle out of court but added that \u0027nevertheless the prince is saying that he denies everything.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Kate Garraway shuts GMB cancel culture debate comic defends burkas letterbox remark","story":"Share this articleCancel culture is a grave threat to comedy - spiked"},{"url":null,"title":"Its Britains fertile land theres plan cover 2 800 acres solar panels","story":"Share this articleShare this article ‘It’s simple things like that which to a lot of people are vital for their mental health.

We\u0027re not moving women into more senior roles quickly enough – and I think it\u0027s my role as the Government\u0027s Women in Finance champion but also as a woman leading an organisation to make sure that we create the right environment for women to flourish and for women to be given the same opportunities as men. \u0027So we just need to make sure that in the way that we work, we don\u0027t jeopardise women\u0027s opportunities.\u0027Speaking about the return to work of Aviva employees, she added: \u0027My view is that we would like people to be in the office around three days a week.

Now it won\u0027t but they\u0027re still very ambitious on balance, their identity comes from work, and they understand the significance of organisational politics.\u0027I\u0027m just hoping that men learn something during this period of time and develop much more of a role within the family and their kids.\u0027We’ll never return to the office, say two fifths of staff | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Britain battered 80mph winds Storm Malik sweeps in","story":"Share this articleTrapped woman rescued after huge tree crushes her car during Storm Malik - Manchester Evening NewsStorm Malik: \u0027Very lucky\u0027 man escapes van crushed by tree - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrew branded Beijings useful idiot","story":"Share this article During a visit in May 2018, the Duke reportedly extolled the virtues of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The vaccine is easy to store and transport as it can be kept at normal fridge temperatures, raising hopes that it will help to plug a deep gap in vaccine provision between richer and poorer countries. It is also based on a more traditional vaccine technology than the more novel mRNA vaccines.The European Commission and Novavax signed a contract in August for the delivery of up to 200 million doses, of which half is optional.The Minister said the vaccine was given in two doses with an interval of three weeks between doses.Severe diseaseMr Donnelly said in statement on Saturday: “The vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic, moderate and severe disease. We expect the vaccine to be available next month, and I would urge the small number of people who have yet to come forward for a primary course of a Covid-19 vaccine to do so. “This vaccine will also be suitable for those iniduals who could not avail of another Covid-19 vaccine because of a medical contra-indication eg allergic reaction.”On Saturday, the number of people being treated for Covid-19 in Irish hospitals has dropped to its lowest level so far this year, with 649 people currently hospitalised for the virus.There were 649 people with coronavirus in hospitals across Ireland at 11.30am on Saturday, with 90 discharges in the previous 24 hours. One week ago, on January 22nd, there were 824 people receiving hospital care for Covid, while the week before, on January 15th, 947 people were in hospital with the virus. The latest drop in hospitalisations brings the number of people receiving treatment close to levels seen in late December 31st 2021, when hospitalisations were at 618. Intensive careSome 66 people continue to receive ICU care, down from the 89 Covid patients receiving intensive care two weeks ago. Data released on Thursday shows Galway University Hospital is caring for the highest number of Covid patients followed by the Mater and Beaumont hospitals in Dublin. Another 5,109 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in Ireland on Friday, while 4,482 more people have registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.These figures were among the latest Covid-19 data reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday evening. The Department of Health said on Friday the daily case numbers would no longer be reported at the weekends and that the figure for Saturdays and Sunday would now be recorded on Mondays.Nearly 92 per cent of people in the State have been vaccinated against Covid-19 including around 100,000 children aged 5-11 years. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn urged parents and s considering whether to get their child vaccinated to be careful about the information they rely on. “If you are in a position where you are considering getting your child vaccinated, please go the HSE website or talk to your GP who will be more than happy to discuss the benefits of the vaccination with you so you can make an informed decision,” said Dr Glynn in a Twitter video on Friday. “From my own perspective, as a dad with a child in this age group, we went to the HSE website, we looked at all of the information there on the benefits and the potential risks of the vaccination, and having considered all that data, we decided to get our child vaccinated.”Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland the deaths of three further people who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 were reported.The North’s Department of Health said another 3,590 confirmed cases of the virus had also been notified in the last 24-hour reporting period. – Additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"small number of omicron sub lineage detected in state","story":"Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said there are indications that the presence of BA.2 could be rising. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThere has been a “small number” of cases of a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant detected in the State, a public health official has said.However, Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said there are indications that the presence of BA.2 could be rising.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Omicron variant has three main sub-lineages: BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3.BA.1 was largely responsible for the surge in Omicron cases over the winter period, according to the WHO, which resulted in record-breaking case numbers detected in many countries.However, the prevalance of the BA.2 sub-lineage has increased internationally in recent weeks. It has already become dominant in Denmark and is likely to become dominant in the UK in the coming weeks.The UK Health Security Agency has declared the sub-lineage a “variant of investigation”, with early analysis suggesting it has a growth advantage when compared to BA.1.SeverityThere is currently no data on the severity of BA.2 compared to BA.1, and a preliminary assessment by UK officials did not find a difference in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease between the two.In response to questions from The , Mr De Gascun said the UK risk assessment “doesn’t give too much cause for alarm at this stage”.The difference in mutations between the two subtypes allows officials to monitor the emergence of BA.1 through genome sequencing, he added.“So, while we’ve seen only small numbers of BA.2 cases in our sequencing to date, the SGTF proportion has declined from 97 per cent to 93 per cent over the last few days, so that could signal the start of something, which we will of course continue to monitor,” Mr de Gascun said.Genome sequencingAccording to figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), some 2,936 cases of Covid-19 in Ireland have been identified as the Omicron variant through genome sequencing between November 25th and January 17th.Of those, 2,926 were BA.1, nine were BA.2 and one was BA.3.The WHO has said that investigation into the characteristics of BA.2, including virulence, should be “prioritised independently (and comparatively) to BA.1”.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reported an additional 5,109 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday.In addition, 4,482 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal on Thursday.As of 8am on Friday, 707 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of whom 69 were in ICU.The Department of Health said it will no longer report daily case numbers at the weekends.

We are so unbelievably happy to have him back…’Irish businessman Richard O’Halloran said he is looking forward to “doing normal everyday family things” following his return home from China.Mr O’Halloran was reunited with his family in Dublin Airport this morning after he was permitted to leave China following an enforced stay of almost three years.Significant payments will continue to Chinese authorities for years following a deal struck to enable his return.Mr O’Halloran was permitted to leave China on Friday after becoming embroiled in a legal dispute involving the chairman and main shareholder of his Dublin-based company.He was reunited with his family in Dublin Airport this morning and travelled home on an Air France flight via Seoul and Paris Charles de Gaulle, arriving at Dublin Airport at 8.10am on Saturday, a spokesman confirmed.Mr O’Halloran’s wife Tara, who has helped run a high-profile campaign calling for his release over the past three years, tweeted a photo of the family all together shortly after 8am on Saturday.The family have four children – Ben (15), Amber (12), Bella (10) and Scarlett (8).Mr O’Halloran initially flew to China in 2019 during the fallout from a crowdsourcing deal for an aircraft owned by his employer, China International Aviation Leasing Service.However, despite giving evidence against the firm’s one-time chairman Min Jiedong, who was convicted of offences relating to the deal, Mr O’Halloran was prevented from leaving.At one stage, €30 million was demanded of Mr O’Halloran, while hundreds of thousands of euro were paid over to the Chinese authorities derived from income associated with the lease of the plane purchased under the original crowdsourcing deal.Happiness and emotionMr O’Halloran issued a statement this morning on his arrival back home.“This is a day of great happiness and emotion as I rejoin Tara, Ben, Amber, Isabella, and Scarlett after three years,” he said.“There was considerable input by a number of key iniduals who were central in helping to arrive at this positive outcome and it is also important that I take this opportunity to thank and to express my sincere appreciation and that of my family, for the incredible support we have received over the past three years.“Mr Simon Coveney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was a key figure in reaching a solution and he invested huge effort over a long period, but particularly in recent weeks, leading to a positive outcome.“My wider family and friends of the family have been so important in the support they provided both in a practical and emotional sense and with Tara I express our sincere gratitude. I would like in particular to thank my mother and father. Throughout the three-year period there have been so many people who have signed petitions, who were active on social media, who wrote letters to newspapers, and who made unsolicited generous contact with my family with offers of support and help. This generosity of spirit can never be repaid.“I would like to sincerely thank The President of Ireland, Mr Michael D Higgins who wrote to his counterpart in China.“A number of politicians at national and European level have been so supportive and I am sure I am missing some, but I have to sincerely express my gratitude to Deputies Charlie Flanagan TD, Peadar Tóibín TD, Eoin Ó Broin TD, Cathal Berry TD and Cormac Devlin TD Senator Michael McDowell, Senator Gerard Craughwell, Senator Barry Ward and in Europe, Barry Andrews MEP, Sean Kelly MEP, and Frances Fitzgerald MEP. Also, Councillor Hazel Chu in Dublin.“I would like to acknowledge the kindness of the people in China who looked after me when I was unwell and also note the support of Consular officials Wendy Dorman-Smith and Alison Meagher.“I would like to sincerely thank the media in Ireland and overseas, for all the interest and support shown to Tara, my family and myself since 2019. The role of the media has been essential in maintaining awareness about the challenging situation I was in and I am very grateful for that. While I realise and understand the huge public interest, as reflected by the media, I hope in the coming period to spend time in private with my family and slowly return to normal living in Ireland.“A number of other people have been very instrumental in the background in assisting in arriving at a solution including Ulick McEvaddy my colleague in CALS Donal Martin Denis O’Brien and my brother David O’Halloran (who resides in the US). I know they are reluctant to take any credit, but I have to acknowledge their help.“Finally, and most importantly, my own family Ben, Amber, Isabella, Scarlett and especially my wife Tara. This has been an incredible challenge for them too and they endured many dark days. But they were always a beacon of light and hope for me and the hundreds of Messenger calls we had helped me to remain positive. Tara was an incredible tower of strength and kept the show on the road. I am home with them now and we are all looking forward to getting to know each other again and doing normal everyday family things.“Once again, my sincere heartfelt thanks to everybody.”Future commitmentsMr O’Halloran had to make two court appearances in Shanghai earlier this week to finalise and sign off on financial arrangements and future commitments to pave the way for the lifting of the exit ban.It is understood the financial commitments relate to future payments from the income on the aircraft that was purchased with money raised from Chinese investors and leased to a Finnish airline.The agreement is also understood to relate to the return of the aircraft to the Chinese authorities when the lease agreement ends in 2026. Monthly payments of more than $100,000 (€90,000) are currently being made to the Chinese authorities.The Chinese embassy in Dublin, confirming that Mr O’Halloran’s exit ban had been lifted, tweeted on Friday that “it is expected that he continues to fulfil his pledges and commitment and undertake his corresponding legal obligations”.The deal came at the culmination of a years-long diplomatic effort, centred on the Department of Foreign Affairs led by Mr Coveney.“This has been a difficult time for Mr O’Halloran and his family,” Mr Coveney said on Friday. “The Government has been actively engaged on the matter throughout and is delighted it has reached a successful result.”Protracted processHis family were said to be delighted at the culmination of a protracted process, which saw them engage in high-profile lobbying for his release. It is understood that his wife, Tara O’Halloran, had been set to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs next week.However, there was criticism for the Government. Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews, who lobbied for Mr O’Halloran’s release, said he was “puzzled” that Mr Coveney expressed gratitude to the Chinese authorities for their help when they were responsible for his detention.“It surprised me because it implies the Chinese authorities were blameless in the matter and clearly they weren’t,” he said.“This was a negotiation between the Irish and Chinese authorities. The implication of that is that the Chinese authorities were controlling the process and a process that had no basis in law.”Mr Andrews also criticised the Department of Foreign Affairs for not using the resources of the European Union’s delegation in Beijing to help in Mr O’Halloran’s case.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"post brexit checks for goods moving into north are not fit for purpose eu officials","story":"An anti-NI protocol sign near Larne port, one of the locations of post-Brexit agrifood checks. File photograph: Mark MarlowBloombergEU officials have said that the system for post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland is “not fit for purpose”.A draft report by EU officials, compiled following an audit carried out by the European Commission in June last year, is highly critical of the current system of agrifood checks and recommends a series of changes.Officials say the UK government has “failed to ensure that sufficient resources – human and structural – have been made available to the responsible competent authorities in Northern Ireland”.Since the UK left the EU, new trade arrangements have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, with the aim being to avoid the creation of a hard Border on the island of Ireland.The latter has been achieved by effectively keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market for goods, which has led to the checks on agrifood products crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland from Britain.Staffing was cited as a major issue, with EU officials bemoaning an insufficient number of “suitably qualified staff so that official controls and other official activities can be performed efficiently and effectively”.‘Stunt’This week, Stormont’s DUP First Minister Paul Givan said his party colleague Edwin Poots will order a stop to the controversial checks, but the anticipated move by the North’s Minister for Agriculture has been branded a stunt by other parties in Northern Ireland.The other Executive parties insist Mr Poots does not have the authority to prevent checks required under the terms of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international treaty.Unionists parties and loyalist groups have long been opposed to the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, arguing that they damage the union between the region and Britain.The UK and the EU remain in talks as both sides attempt to reach a deal on issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, the portion of the withdrawal agreement that has given rise to the trading arrangements.Among the recommendations contained in the report are calls to ensure that the authorities have access to a sufficient number of qualified staff, as well as pointing out the need for better facilities and improved information-sharing.“Undertakings given in the United Kingdom’s unilateral declarations have also not been delivered,” the report concludes.“The system in place for controlling the entry of animals and goods into the EU SPS area via Northern Ireland border control posts does not, and cannot in the current circumstances, function effectively.” – PA How is Brexit affecting you?

It takes seconds to post on social media but the fallout can last much longer. It’s important to think before you post, particularly when a matter is the subject of court proceedings or a Garda investigation. Being fair and accurate is crucial. The potentially serious consequences for overstepping the legal lines include a fine, and even jail, for contempt of court or damages for defamation. Here’s a guide to help stay on the right side of the law when you’re online. What’s the legal position when a person is arrested in connection with a criminal offence?The matter is deemed to be sub judice, meaning it’s before a court or judge, and there are clear limits on what can and cannot be said. From the time an inidual is arrestedcharged, the facts are for a court to decide. An inidual arrested and questioned in connection with a criminal offence should not be identified prior to being charged.Why can’t more details be given?Because we operate in a democracy governed by the rule of law. An accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until proven guilty. Public discussion of the case, which can sometimes be ill-informed, could prejudice a jury whose role is to decide the facts.So what can I say? It’s best to say nothing when a matter is subject of criminal proceedings. There are good reasons for this, including that information circulated about an accused or crime is sometimes inaccurate and whipping up public opinion against accused people has contributed in the past to people being convicted of offences they didn’t commit. What happens if an arrestedcharged person is identified? It depends on what is said. Anyone who publishes negative material about someone who is arrested leaves themselves open to contempt of court andor defamation proceedings. When material about a charged person, or details of the offence with which they are charged, is published, the consequences can be serious. Apart from exposing its publisher to defamation and contempt proceedings, such publication has potential to derail or even collapse a jury trial.What does defamation mean?Defamation is the publication to at least one other person of comment, inaccurate statements, false reporting or other material capable of causing damage to the reputation of a person, business or other organisation. The Defamation Act 2009 defines a “defamatory statement” as one “that tends to injure a person’s reputation in the eyes of reasonable members of society”. Anyone suing for defamation has to show there was “publication, by any means” of defamatory material concerning them to one, or more than one, person. The Act applies to ALL publications and there is a rising number of cases alleging defamation and contempt of court over online content, including social media posts. A couple received €30,000 damages against their neighbour in county Donegal who had put up a Facebook post making allegations including of an affair. Surely I can say what I like to my friends and family in my WhatsApp groups?There’s a risk in saying what you like, even on WhatsApp, if the content is defamatory. Online defamation is the publication of defamatory statements in e-mails, web postings, Facebook posts, tweets and mobile phone group messaging such as WhatsApp groups. A retweet or simple forwarding of a message can be akin to acting as the original publisher, particularly if further comment is added.What about the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter? Can they be sued over what’s posted on their sites? E-commerce regulations mean intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are excluded from liability under a “hosting defence” for material published on their systems where they are unaware of the defamatory, false or criminal content. If intermediaries are given notice of defamatory material, they are expected to take it down speedily if they want to benefit from the hosting defence and are not deemed to be a publisher. Orders may also be sought against internet service providers aimed at identifying posters of defamatory material. Anonymity online is not absolute due to protocols on device and internet addressing.

Mr Coveney said he wrote a letter to the Russian defence minister this week requesting a reconsideration of naval exercises off the Irish coast. “This evening I received a letter confirming the Russian exercises will be relocated outside of Ireland’s EEZ. I welcome this response,” Mr Coveney said on Twitter on Saturday. Russian naval drills were due to be undertaken outside Ireland’s sea territory but within the State’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) about 240km off the coast of west Cork next week. This left Irish fishermen angry at the potential disruption to their traditional fishing grounds with up to 60 trawlers expected to start fishing these waters. Russian ambassador to Ireland Yuriy Filatov confirmed the decision of Russia’s defence minister Sergey Shoigu to relocate the military exercises following requests from the Irish Government and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, which met the ambassador at the embassy in Dublin earlier this week.Mr Filatov said in a statement that the decision was made by Mr Shoigu as “a gesture of goodwill” with “the aim not to hinder fishing activities by the Irish vessels in the traditional fishing areas”.This week I wrote to my counterpart, the Minister of Defence of Russia, to request a reconsideration of naval exercises off the Irish coast. This evening I received a letter confirming the Russian exercises will be relocated outside of Ireland’s EEZ. I welcome this response.— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney) Brendan Byrne, chief executive of the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, who along with the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation met the ambassador this week, told The  that he welcomed Russia’s decision to relocate the naval exercises. “It was in an eco-sensitive area. It was in an area that Irish fishermen rely on for their livelihoods because it was in a spawning ground for Irish pelagic fishing stocks,” he said.“It was a sensible decision and we commend them for taking it. I congratulate the entire Irish fishing industry in standing united in their campaign to have these drills moved outside the EEZ.”No harm intendedThe Russian ambassador had previously said that the naval exercises were “not in any way a threat to Ireland or anybody else” and that “no harm is intended” and “no problem is expected”.The Department of Transport had issued a safety notice to all seafarers warning of the exact location of the planned Russian naval drills off the southwest coast.Mr Coveney had also previously said that the plans were “not welcome” but that Ireland did not have the powers to prevent the exercises from happening.“I have made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it’s not welcome. This is not a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what is happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,” he said last week. “It’s important that I brief my colleagues on those intentions. Russia, under international law, can take military exercises in international waters, but the fact they are choosing to do it on the west borders of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that is in our view not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks.”ConcernTaoiseach Micheál Martin had also expressed concern for the safety of west Cork fishermen who planned to peacefully protest Russian military exercises by continuing to fish in the area.Mr Martin said his priority was the welfare of the fishermen who are engaging in the protest and he warned them that they should exercise caution.“People have to be first and foremost conscious of safety, and in our view that is not the safest thing to be doing, fishing close to where military drilling is taking place,” he said.“We will at some stage engage with the fishermen on this and take advice on that. There needs to be balance here and proportionality on how it is addressed with safety always at the forefront.”"},{"url":null,"title":"italian president stays for second term to end political stalemate","story":"Italian president Sergio Mattarella delivering a speech after his re-election in Rome.Photograph:  HandoutQuirinale Press OfficeAFP via Getty ImagesItalian president Sergio Mattarella has been elected to a second seven-year term as the country’s head of state, ending a political deadlock lasting days as party leaders struggled to choose his successor.Earlier on Saturday, legislators had entreated the 80-year-old, who had said he did not want a second term in office, to change his mind and agree to re-election after a vote in parliament and among regional delegates.The move followed days of fruitless efforts by political leaders to reach a consensus on a candidate.Mr Mattarella won in the eighth round of voting when he clinched the minimum of 505 votes needed from the eligible 1,009 grand electors.Applause broke out in the parliament in Rome, prompting the Chamber of Deputies president to interrupt his reading aloud of the ballots.The count then resumed, with Mr Mattarella’s votes surging well past 670.Mr Mattarella’s first term ends on February 3rd.Ahead of the presidential election this week, Mr Mattarella had repeatedly said he did not want another stint.He even rented an apartment in Rome to prepare for his move from the presidential palace on top of Quirinal Hill.But after a seventh round of balloting in six days in parliament failed to yield any consensus on a presidential candidate, party whips and regional governors visited Mr Mattarella at the presidential palace to solicit his willingness to carry on.Rai state TV said Italian premier Mario Draghi, a non-partisan former chief of the European Central Bank who is leading a pandemic unity government, telephoned party leaders to encourage the lobbying.Mr Draghi had previously indicated he would be willing to move into the presidential role, but some party leaders featured that would prompt an early election.Mr Mattarella’s willingness to serve again “is a choice of generosity toward the country”, Democratic Party leader Enrico Letta told a news conference minutes before Saturday’s second, conclusive round of voting began.“You don’t change a winning team,” former premier Matteo Renzi told reporters about the current leadership with Mr Draghi, a reassuring figure to financial markets, and Mr Mattarella as president.A chorus of Italian politicians had called for Mr Mattarella to reconsider earlier on Saturday.Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who heads the centre-right Forza Italia party he founded, said that unity “today can only be found around the figure of president Sergio Mattarella, of whom we know we’re asking a great sacrifice”.Health minister Roberto Speranza, who heads a small left-wing party, told reporters that Mr Mattarella’s re-election would be crucial for “a context of stability for Italy”.The head of the populist Five-Star Movement – the parliament’s largest force – former premier Giuseppe Conte, told reporters “Mattarella is the guarantor of everybody, impartial, authoritative”.Until 2013, no president had served a second term.Then, a similar political stalemate in several rounds of balloting ended when Giorgio Napolitano, a former communist leader, agreed to accept a second mandate.Mr Napolitano resigned in 2015, when he was nearly 90, clearing the way for the election that made Mr Mattarella Italy’s head of state. –

grisly","story":"It is a majestic castle that would not look out of place as the centrepiece of any glossy TV period drama.However, when an American actor took on the dilapidated Hopwood Hall (nicknamed Downton Shabby) as a DIY project, little did he know that he would uncover a centuries-old feud triggered by a grisly longbow murder.Hopwood DePree\u0027s ancestors used to live at the 15th century grade II listed building on the outskirts of Manchester, but it has stood derelict since the 1920s.DePree plans to restore the castle to its former beauty, with hopes of making it a country retreat, hotel and community hub.But as he delved into the historic building\u0027s past, he discovered that his ancestors had been responsible for killing one of their neighbours.In the 1500s, Ralph Hopwood (DePree\u0027s x20 great-grandfather) drew his longbow and shot an arrow at a neighbour after he trespassed onto Hopwood land. The arrow pierced the intruder through the chest. He later died in his wife\u0027s arms.DePree discusses the medieval murder in depth in his book Downton Shabby: One American\u0027s Ultimate DIY Adventure Restoring His Family\u0027s English Castle.He moved to the UK from California to begin the renovation after stumbling upon the building while exploring an ancestry website, and felt compelled to reconnect with his past.Since the longbow murder in the 1500s, there have been other intruders at Hopwood Hall.One youngster recently broke in, injuring himself in the process, then left a trail of blood through the building. Before leaving, he eerily wrote help in blood on the walls.Some parts of Hopwood Hall, which dates back to 1426, are 600 years old. Lord Byron stayed there briefly in 1811.It has 60 rooms, 812 windows, 35 chimneys and 107 doors.When DePree, 51, first visited the hall, it was vandalised and graffitied.But, with the help of an army of determined local volunteers, he is determined to continue his incredible progress and open Hopwood Hall to the public by 2025.He told The : It\u0027s been a completely unexpected adventure but so rewarding and fun. It\u0027s in full progress and we\u0027ve made a lot of advancements. We want to bring it back to its original grandeur and preserve the estate, and to transform it into an arts and culture venue, with accommodation of 25 bedrooms to host people for retreats. I\u0027d love to live there when it\u0027s ready.We\u0027re doing it in multiple phases, making it wind and water tight. One section will be open for tours this summer. We\u0027ve had so many requests for weddings. I\u0027ve done minor bathroom and kitchen remodelling but nothing of this grand scale - certainly nothing in this time frame!He and his team have painstakingly chipped off the cement rendering used on the walls to replace it with more modern plaster.Now people are having biscuits and making tea, enjoying the garden, he said. The lights have come back on. There\u0027s electricity and running water.As DePree delved into his past during the project, he discovered that Ralph Hopwood was not the only one of his ancestors to cause a stir in the community.Lady Susan Hopwood was born in the 1810s and married the heir of the hall, Captain Edward, who legally acquired it in 1880.She was a fierce environmentalist and hired her own personal inspectors to go on the hunt for evidence that cotton mills were polluting the area, with the aim of bringing prosecutions against the mill owners.As a member of a prominent smoke abatement society, she held a gala in aid of the issue at Hopwood Park in 1893 and 5,000 guests turned up to support her.She was an early member of Greenpeace in a way, said DePree. Cotton mills were pouring pollution into the Manchester skyline and she was out there talking about it.His book is available for pre-order on Amazon and will be published in the UK on June 9.More from NewsStorm Malik: Nine-year-old boy killed by falling treeBritain ramps up firepower to deter Russian invasionBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak jointly commit to National Insurance hikeBoris Johnson’s senior aide watched cricket as Kabul fellLiz Truss launches plan to encourage more women into STEM jobsFar-flung free health insurance scheme on cards for UK travellersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china may using interpol target dissidents political opponents","story":"China is misusing Interpol to hunt down Hong Kong dissidents and other political opponents in Britain, it has been claimed.UK-based exiles and activists are bracing themselves for an expected onslaught of “red notices”, meaning they could be arrested when they travel abroad and handed back to the communist regime.The international law enforcement agency is not supposed to be used for political ends.However, it has attracted growing criticism in recent years for granting requests on behalf of dictatorial regimes.Fears over the agency’s alleged disregard of human rights were further heightened in November after a Middle East police official accused of overseeing torture was elected the body’s president.Now officials in Hong Kong are talking openly about using Interpol as a means of bringing dissidents back to the territory.It follows a dramatic expansion in the variety of crimes being prosecuted under the draconian National Security Law, which was introduced in 2020.The Hong Kong Police Force has become increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of opponents living abroad.It has made clear that it will also pursue foreign nationals it accuses of assisting protesters.Sixteen prominent Hong Kong human rights campaigners, six of whom live in the UK, have now written to the agency demanding to know whether the Chinese government or the Hong Kong Police Force has sought to use Interpol against them, and whether any red notices have been issued.They say that without reassurances from Interpol, they are effectively prisoners in the UK.“There is a real fear that Hong Kong, or China, might have already used Interpol tools against us, and if not, and perhaps the greater fear for most of us signing this letter, is Hong Kong and China’s intent on doing so, as they freely admit in public,” the letter states.It is signed by Yau Man-Chun, a former Hong Kong legislator who fled the new security law, as well as Simon Cheng, a former British Consulate employee who claims he was tortured by the Chinese authorities.Luke de Pulford, who helps coordinate the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, is also a signatory, having been warned by the Foreign Office last year he was at risk of extradition and prosecution in Hong Kong.They point out that in 2017 Interpol issued a red notice against Idris Hasan, a Uyghur activist who now faces deportation to China from Morocco.Mr Cheng called on the UK government to lobby Interpol to cancel any red notices against human rights exiles and for the organisation to disclose if it had issued any.“Interpol is like a black box and we don’t know what’s in it,” he said.“We are very worried that they will just follow China’s instructions.“We don’t know which countries it is safe to fly to.”Ten countries currently have extradition treaties with China, of which two are EU member states, Portugal and the Czech Republic.However Interpol, which has a much wider membership, gives China another potential tool to hunt down its enemies.A Home Office spokesman said: “Any misuse of Interpol is taken incredibly seriously. We continue to support Interpol’s efforts to protect iniduals’ rights and uphold its constitution, which forbids the organisation to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character.“Interpol plays a vital role every day to protect the public and the UK looks forward to continuing our close relationship with them, including the newly elected Executive Committee.”More from NewsStorm Malik: Nine-year-old boy killed by falling treeBritain ramps up firepower to deter Russian invasionBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak jointly commit to National Insurance hikeBoris Johnson’s senior aide watched cricket as Kabul fellLiz Truss launches plan to encourage more women into STEM jobsFar-flung free health insurance scheme on cards for UK travellersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paris no longer city culture city despair","story":"Things have come to a pretty pass when the chief Paris arts fair, FIAC, held in its present form for almost half a century, gets kicked out by the Swiss. Art Basel, now owned by a conglomerate, won a surprise tender offer from the French National Museum Authority, and will take up FIAC’s slots at the Grand Palais off the Champs Élysées for the next seven years. This stands on the very location where Manet held his 1863 “Salon des Refusés” for his daring Impressionist fellow-painters, including Pissarro and Courbet, then rejected from the grand annual Académie des Beaux-Arts Salon. Art Basel grew out of a well-regarded 1970 event launched by three gallery-owners in Switzerland’s third largest city, where the first art museum in history was created in 1661. It now gathers close to 300 galleries and representatives from 400 museums worldwide: the Swiss, untroubled by wars, revolutions, and economic crises in recent centuries, are noted collectors with taste and deep pockets. But experts fear the fair’s current iterations (they opened in Miami Beach and Hong Kong before setting their sights on Paris) have created a monster whose Paris post-victory press release, written in flawless PR-ese, featured buzzwords like “investment dynamic” and “market”. Some French gallery-owners, who are promised pride of place by the newcomers, are unhappy. “Paris, unlike, say, London, has a real, lively market, with a erse and original offer, from the very accessible to museum quality pieces. This will bring uniformisation, with a more business-like but standardised offer, highly financialised,” says one of them, the noted art adviser Cyrille de Gunzburg.To Parisians, this is but the latest instalment in a long saga of official neglect. When the fair moves back to the revamped Grand Palais, visitors and exhibitors will pass the symbol of the city’s careless acceptance of self-marketed art: Jeff Koons’s 41-ft tall, 27-ton “Tulips”, an ugly contraption of aluminium, bronze and epoxy paint where a realistic (some say “obscene”) massive pink hand holds the stems of a multi-coloured bouquet of oblong balloons. The sculpture was given to the city, supposedly to commemorate the 2015 terror attacks with the work’s €3.5 million actual construction and upkeep costs borne by unhappy Parisian taxpayers. Where noted architects once produced controversial but important works, like the Louvre’s glass pyramid entrance, cultural policy in Paris has become a mix of performative woke laziness and spendthrift subsidies. Take the beautiful 18th century Rotonde by the classical architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, now made into a rat-infested, graffitied “Hybrid Cultural Area” in City Hall’s newspeak, grandly called a “trattoria-lounge ouverte au clubbing et au design” (where is the Académie Française when you need it?) Or the concrete and plywood “sheep” penned by rusty railings at the Parc Monceau, once one of Paris’s most beautiful “Parcs à l’Anglaise”. Take the projected 180m-high Tour Triangle skyscraper, which even Unesco warns will change the Parisian skyline. Or the Art Déco Palais de Tokyo, overlooking the Seine: its modern art galleries have been reduced to make space for a compendium of contemporary “art” featuring skateboarding performance artists, concrete girders and “artistic interventions”, all supposedly providing, in Meghan-Markleish lingo, a “convivial and challenging, generous and cutting edge, inviting and radical, poetic and transgressive space to learn, to experience, to feel, and to live”.Meanwhile, monuments, from the 1547 Fontaine des Innocents to the unique, listed 1896 Pagoda, are first left to degrade, then replaced by modern horrors, or sold off, like the Italianate Hôtel Dieu hospital opposite Notre Dame, to become luxury hotels. The City of Light, once the world capital of culture, has become a battered old lady on her way to a dismal care home.More from NewsStorm Malik: Nine-year-old boy killed by falling treeBritain ramps up firepower to deter Russian invasionBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak jointly commit to National Insurance hikeBoris Johnson’s senior aide watched cricket as Kabul fellLiz Truss launches plan to encourage more women into STEM jobsFar-flung free health insurance scheme on cards for UK travellersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saint jacinda has made controlling covid iron fisted moral mission","story":"If, like me, you thrill to see women running countries and companies, then Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s leader, was a tempting prospect. Her seduction of the world’s arbiters of respectable opinion was immediate and total, spawning glowing media headlines in the prestige press. “Arise, St Jacinda!” gushed one. “The Most Effective Leader on the Planet” crowed the Atlantic. One influential American sex podcaster even commended her superiority to US leaders on the novel basis that her early Covid lockdowns had enabled Kiwis to frolic free and date without fear of catching Covid when restrictions finally eased.The Ardern effect is understandable. She is young, pretty, self-assured, feminist and a triumphant mother, who delighted in being the first female world leader to attend the UN General Assembly with her babe-in-arms in 2018. Her woke credentials are impeccable too. At 11 per cent LGBT, 50 per cent women, and with Maori and other indigenous peoples slightly over-represented, hers is the most “erse” cabinet in the world.Last November, fans cooed over the appearance of her now-three-year-old daughter, who had got out of bed and called “mummy” while Ardern was addressing the nation on the new Covid rules via video-link. By then, however, some were also pretty disconcerted to see their leader still addressing the nation from home, on a Zoom call. It was a jarring sight, skin to a time-warp, since for some months the rest of the West had resumed normal life, or at least attempted to.But now, as Omicron gently settles there, Ardern’s New Zealand has lost any remaining halo of Covid superiority. It looks neither ‘compassionate’, nor even ‘tough’ or ‘hardline’ but completely pathological. Mad. Bonkers. Pitiable. And not without a whiff of totalitarianism.You might think that a lefty as vocally committed to social justice and human rights as Ardern would shy away from draconian curbs based on a chimaera (zero covid). In the absence of a credible threat, it is a strategy whose main effect would be to destroy people’s livelihoods and will to live.In fact, those who purport, like Ardern, to be the most virtuous and “inclusive”, the keenest on helping the marginalised, are often all too comfortable playing fast and loose with the little people’s lives: and the keenest on controlling everyone. They love power - so long as it’s in their hands - and Covid has provided a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for grabbing it.As Britain threw off all remaining restrictions, while Western Europe loosened its most draconian measures and America, despite vaccine mandates in some states, largely roared ahead with business as usual, Ardern battened down the hatches yet again, pushing New Zealand back into code “red” in its “Covid protection framework”.The trigger was nine cases of Omicron in a single family that had returned home to the South Island from Auckland. Yet with more than 90 per cent of the population double-jabbed, 57 per cent of those due boosters boosted, and high summer in full swing, the country should be in better shape than almost any other to shrug off Omicron with minimal disruption.Not in Ardern’s New Zealand, where – as trapped and desperate Kiwis wail in the British press – beaches, towns and tourist sites are empty starved of custom and the will of dejected locals to enjoy life. Ardern’s obsession with iron-fisted power is the only explanation for an escalation in restrictions that, in January 2022, makes no sense whatsoever.To the increasing horror of trapped New Zealanders, Omicron-affected NZ households must now isolate for up to 24 days, while gatherings are capped at 100 in hospitality venues (25 if vaccine passports aren’t being used). But home-testing has effectively been outlawed: only ‘trained testers’ or medical staff can perform Covid tests, and the import of rapid antigen tests, such as those we in Britain rely on by the bucketload to keep life going, could end up in prison.Ardern has cancelled her own wedding and once can’t help but feel that such showy martyrdom, which would be entirely avoidable under a sane Covid policy, has become a pillar of her leadership identity. “Such is life,” she said pseudo philosophically of her axed nuptials. Such is life under her rule, yes.But the most chilling aspect of Ardern’s monomaniacal leadership is the complete lack of respect for borders – not their inviolability (she has shown that aspect of them to be firmly intact) but their prison-like oppressiveness.Previously, it was possible to enter New Zealand, by winning a coveted slot in a quarantine hotel, where you would be watched over by military personnel throughout. But since the Omicron Nine, the country has now closed itself to all travellers. Tourism was once New Zealand’s biggest export, but too bad: the Dear Leader’s obsession with total control comes first.Unlike many of my ideological stablemates, I actually think lockdowns had their place, and I have never bought the argument that Britain under Boris Johnson became China by stealth. Ardern’s New Zealand, however, is a different story, where lockdown mentality has been used to pursue a maniacally illiberal agenda.Saint Jacinda, so woke, so feminist, so unimpeachable, has blinded the world with her virtue, and in so doing has made controlling Covid not a balance of risks, but an iron-fisted moral mission. Within that context, almost any amount of masochism can be justified.Yes, New Zealanders may be “safer” from Omicron than any other population on earth, but, thanks to Ardern, they are being robbed of the freedoms that make life worth living, with no end in sight.More from NewsStorm Malik: Nine-year-old boy killed by falling treeBritain ramps up firepower to deter Russian invasionBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak jointly commit to National Insurance hikeBoris Johnson’s senior aide watched cricket as Kabul fellLiz Truss launches plan to encourage more women into STEM jobsFar-flung free health insurance scheme on cards for UK travellersMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccinations children aged 5","story":"Covid vaccinations for children aged - to roll out this weekJabs will initially go to , kids most clinically at risk from the disease including those with diabetes and learning disabilities or who live in a household where someone is immunosuppressed Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  Jan |commentsThe mass rollout of Covid vaccine to children aged between  -  begins this week.

MHRA boss Dr June Raine said: “Parents and carers can be reassured that no new vaccine would have been approved unless the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been met.”  And it is being widely used in other countries, with five million children jabbed in the US alone.

We are asking parents not to delay coming forward.” One in  schoolchildren are now off sick or isolating, with cases still going up in younger age groups. Any child who has tested positive will not be able to get jabbed until four weeks after they are clear. More than  million jabs including  million booster doses have been delivered by the NHS so far.

The Prime Minister will spend the weekend at his Chequers retreatBoris is waiting tooopinionByKeir Mudie:,  Jan |commentsI canapost remember ever being so excited over waiting for something to be published.Maybe when I was waiting for the last Rebus to come out . This Sue Gray report is having the same effect. Last thing I check before bed, first thing when I get up. Has it landed  Tragic way to live, really.Westminster is a bit like those books at the moment. I love Ian Rankin but I find myself reading them not for the plots – like I did at the start – but more for what’s been going on with Rebus. And that’s the way things are round here these days. There’s a cost of living crisis coming, war brewing, all sorts of problems, but the most fascinating thing is the psychodrama going on around the PM and Sue Gray.  It was due Thursday, then possibly Friday. Now they reckon it’s due tomorrow. What’s in there, do you think  What’s the hold-up  It seems pretty clear that it’s not going to be good news for the PM. People I speak to in Whitehall tell me they had to change their media lines because it went from “very bad” to “terrible” very quickly. The excitement. Labour is in a slightly tricky position. The bind seems to be, do you want Mr Johnson to stay or keep the pressure on and kick him out  There are two schools of thought. The first is that it would be beneficial to keep him around, kick him repeatedly until the next election and then let him limp into a defeat. The danger with that strategy is thatMr Johnson rides this crisis out we will head into the summer, the Commonwealth Games, the Jubilee celebrations, the weather, and everyone’s mood picks up, and all this becomes a distant memory.  Mr Johnson becomes a good-time PM again. The other danger is that you would be letting a lame duck run the show during an exceptionally dficult time for the country. The other school of thought is that taking a scalp at any time is good. Also,Rishi Sunak is the favourite to take over, it might be quite nice to have him in place. A new billionaire PM – and former hedge fund boss – as we stagger into the cost of living crisis. That’s quite easy to frame for a Labour attack. Anyways. We’ll see. Maybe Tuesday. We are in the hands of Sue Gray, who sounds like she knows what she’s doing and – as civil servants go – is an interesting character. Thorough and no-nonsense are the words used to describe her. Fair is another. Ms Gray used to run a pub in Northern Ireland, which suggests she knows a party when she sees one. And her husband is a country and western singer. Who could not have faith in someone married to a country and western singer  I like that music, which is honest stuff and manages to be very serious while not taking itself too seriously at the same time. I collect some of the funnier titles, like I Wouldn’t Take Her to a Dogfightor You’re A Hard Dog To Keep Under The Porch.

And a further , working in private homes are set to follow under rules which mean they must have their first jab by Thursday. That equates to one care worker being lost for every elderly and vulnerable person they look after. Care worker Theresa Darby, , of Hersham, Surrey always masks up and wears gloves on visits but she is being sacked this week from her £-an-hour job she has done for six years because she is unvaccinated. She is frightened her enlarged heart caused by cardiomyopathy means the jab would put her in danger. But doctors will not give her a medical exemption. She said: “This stupid and ridiculous government says people can now visit care homes without restrictions.“But it is happy to fire those of us who do the caring..“I’m being blackmailed by the government into having a vaccine which may harm me. It’s disgraceful.”  The Homecare Association estimates that nearly one in five of its members have not been jabbed - and losing them will come on top of , unfilled posts.Frontline NHS staff and home carers need proof of being doubled jabbed by April . Up to , NHS staff will get dismissal warnings from Friday.Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said: “Care is in the grip of a staffing crisis. Homes can ill afford to lose experienced staff. But that’s exactly what’s happening.” Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said: “We strongly support vaccination. But persuasion is likely to be more effective than compulsion among those with genuine fears. “The need is to balance the mitigated risk of infection with the risk of older and disabled people going without vital care. “ Martin Green of charity Care England said it was “grossly unfair” to single out residential staff six months before other care workers. He added: “The virus is not dangerous for certain parts of the sector and not for others. “And mandatory vaccination needs to be accompanied by the necessary resource and support.” Tory backbenchers are pressing ministers to U-turn on the plan as the UK moves out of the pandemic.And Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “We’re reflecting on it because we do have to accept the virus has changed.”Patricia Marquis of the Royal College of Nursing said: “The Government needs to come up with a fully-funded workforce plan.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UnisonConservative PartyNHSRoyal College of NursingBoris JohnsonCare homesHeart diseaseNursing homesHealth insuranceDisabilityPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet we’ve just seen the Chancellor write off £.billion stolen from taxpayers by criminals who abused the furlough schemes. Lesson: don’t be exploited on the minimum wage by amoral firms kids, set up your own one. We tell those who want to become a senior public servant, such as an MP, that they must swear an oath to the Queen vowing “true allegiance” to herself and all her “heirs and successors, according to law”.Yet one of them, her second son, is Prince Andrew. The very sight of whom, I’m guessing, makes most young people want to swear in a dferent way.  Then there’s Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, claiming thatschoolkids want to succeed they need to follow the example of James Dyson. That’s the vacuum cleaner tycoon who ­championed Vote Leave due to the economic opportunities it would bring British industry before moving his global head office to Singapore. In other words, kids, talk the talk, then screw your country, andanyone complains, tell them to suck it up. But what must really puzzle them now is why they need to be truthful. We teach them that honesty is the best policy and cheats never prosper, yet the man elected to the top job in the country is acknowledged by even his closest colleagues to be a liar and a cheat. Treating the truth like a house guest with fleas hasn’t done the Prime Minister’s prospects any harm, has it  What must young people make of that  What must they make of Britain spending the last couple of months in political paralysis over Downing Street’s refusal to admit it was Party Central when their parents will soon struggle to heat the house and Russia threatens war  All because Boris Johnson lacked the moral decency to be honest when Partygate surfaced.  There would have been no need for a drawn-out Sue Gray report or the drip-drip of leaks about illegal drinks in Nothe people who made the rules we were all ordered to follow had owned up to breaking them and faced the consequences. And as Johnson looks to ride out whatever damning conclusions are in that report and carry on as though nothing happened, what does that tell young people on the cusp of adult le  Especially one who has a Tory MP, who, rather than call Johnson out for what he is, cheered him on as he brazened out his shame in the Commons. Or a Tory MP who waits to see how the report’s conclusions play with their constituents before calculating the best course for themselves. Then there’s the country’s top cop, whose skin has been repeatedly saved by the PM, refusing to investigate criminal allegations against him until a report about them is set to be released, then stepping in to effectively censor it. Our revised advice to kids should be that cheats do prosper and honesty’s not the best policy. Looking after No  is.

It should have investigated the partying in Downing Street as soon as it was revealed by this paper. Now, after eventually deciding there was sufficient evidence to launch a criminal inquiry, The Met has demanded Sue Gray delays releasing parts of her report. Whether by accident or design, it has been a helpful ally of Boris Johnson who is playing for time in the hope the scandal will blow over. It may be in his interests to prolong matters but it is certainly not in the country’s. For as long as Partygate remains unresolved the Government is effectively paralysed. The quickest way out of this unsatisfactory situation would have been for him to resign. We don’t need an investigation to know he attended at least one party during lockdown or that his initial denials misled Parliament. A Prime Minister who is honourable and decent would have quit by now. But that is not Boris Johnson, who instead limps on as a discredited and diminished figure. What a choice Nobody should have to decide to heat or eat. But that is the choice facing an increasing number as living costs bite. Not everyone is struggling.

Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on these firms would raise £.billion – enough to cut VAT on fuel and increase the warm homes discount. It speaks volumes that the Tories have rejected the proposal.

It comes as the Prime Minister could finally get sight of the highly anticipated partygate inquiry report from senior civil servant Sue Gray as early as this weekend, after police insisted they had not delayed its publication. No  had still not received a copy of the report into possible lockdown breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall on Saturday morning.It is widely believed that either Chancellor Rishi Sunak or Foreign Secretary Liz Truss are frontrunners to win the top jobthe Prime Minister is ousted. But the Daily Mail reported on Friday that centrist Tories are backing Mr Tugendhat, an ex-soldier. The newspaper said some Conservative MPs believe the Foreign Affairs Committeechairman represents the best chance for a fresh start. The MP for Tonbridge and Malling told Times Radio on Saturday: I think Iaposm making it pretty clear that I think that itaposs up to all of us to put ourselves forward. And itaposs up to the electorate, in the first case parliamentary colleagues, and in the second case the party, to choose. I think itaposs a position of absolute integrity to say that of course you should offer yourself to the electorateyou think you can do it. Of course you should talk to colleagues and seeyou can get a group together, andyou can get a group together you should go for it. Now I havenapost been canvassing support so I donapost knowIaposd be able to get the first group together - youaposve got to get a group first. Butyou could, of course you should have a go.  On being Prime Minister, he said: It would be a huge privilege. Itaposs one of those questions that I know many people ask and some people, some of my colleagues, are coy about and I donapost understand why. I donapost think you should be embarrassed to want to serve your country. I was very proud to serve my country in the armed forces and I got to the highest rank I could so that I could have the best effect that I could. And I was very proud to serve as a diplomat around the world. Mr Tugendhat has previously been critical of the Governmentaposs handling of the UK withdrawal from Afghanistan. In December, he said there had been a lack of leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing in the evacuation from Kabul. After a session of the FAC, he said: The evidence weaposve heard today points to a lack of leadership, urgency and adequate resourcing. It is deeply painful how badly we have let Afghanistan down. As questions persist over the future of his premiership, it is understood Mr Johnson will ramp up deterrence to avoid bloodshed between Russia and Ukraine with a visit to the region in the coming days amid rising tensions. The Prime Minister will also speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin over the phone. The publication of the long-awaited Gray report into alleged lockdown-busting parties was thrown into disarray on Tuesday when politan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, who had long resisted calls to investigate, announced her officers had opened a criminal inquiry. Scotland Yard confirmed on Friday evening that it had received the material requested from the Cabinet Office to support its investigation. The force said officers would examine this without fear or favour to establish whether any rules were broken. The Met had been criticised by legal experts and Tory MPs for urging Ms Gray to limit the publication of her investigation into allegations of lockdown-breaking parties at No , but the force insisted it had not delayed the report. Commander Catherine Roper, who leads the Metaposs Central Specialist Crime Command, said the timing of the documentaposs release was a matter for the Cabinet Office. The PA news agency understands that Mr Johnson could receive a copy over the weekend, or in the coming week, rather than in weeks or months. But it is understood it will comply with any police requests, meaning certain details could be excluded. Downing Street declined to comment on the Met statement on Friday.  The Cabinet Office did not offer further comment on when the document would be published. Ms Roper said the force had asked for minimal reference to be made in the report to the relevant events, to protect the integrity of the police investigation and to be as fair as possible to those who are subject to it. This will only be necessary until these matters are concluded, and is to give detectives the most reliable picture of what happened at these events. We intend to complete our investigations promptly, fairly and proportionately, she said. We have not delayed this report and the timing of its release is a matter for the Cabinet Office inquiry team. Ms Roper said the offences under investigation, where proven, would normally result in the issuing of a fixed penalty notice. Should a recipient dispute the fixed penalty notice then the case will be referred back to the Met where officers will consider whether to pursue the matter in a magistratesapos court, she said. As the commissioner said, we will not be giving a running commentary but we will continue to update when signicant progress is made in the investigative process.

Perhaps it will be released as an opera, so it will cost £ for a ticket to see it. Then we’ll see a chorus of tenors singing “why do you leave us, do not forsake us ” Then the sopranos will reply “We go to Waitrose, to fetch more wine,” in red chfon dresses. Then a booming bass roars cheekily “It’s a workplace meeting”, all in Italian. It’s possible the report has become more complicated because it turns out Prince Andrew was at one of the parties.  Or maybe she can’t finish it because there was a -piece swing band playing in the No bathroom throughout lockdown, and  people re-enacting the Battle of El Alamein in the kitchen, so she has to interview all of them. But now the Met Police have been kind enough to make her job simpler. Because they insist her investigation should leave out anything about the parties. And an investigation is always easieryou don’t have to include anything that you were investigating. To keep the police and the Government happy, her report should go: “On Tuesday it was quite sunny. The end.” Then she can pad it out with  pages of dot-to-dot puzzles and a nice picture of farmyard animals, with suggestions for how to colour them in. The police can make their own lives simpler by applying the same rules to themselves. When they investigate a robbery, they can leave out everything about the robbery from their investigation and they’ll be able to complete their task much more quickly. When the police announced they were investigating the parties, we were told this meant the report might be delayed for several more weeks. That would be convenient. Maybe they’ll keep this going. So next time the report’s about to appear, it will be announced that the Vatican are investigating the parties to see whether they constituted a mortal sin. So the report can’t be published until there’s a pronouncement from the Pope. In any case, the Government’s supporters now say the whole business of parties against the rules is “trivia”. Why are we bothering with wine and cakes, when there’s inflation and a might-be-a-war with Russia   This would make sense,when Johnson was reading out the rules every single day for several months, he’d said: “But don’t bother sticking to any of this. “You can do whatever you like, I’d invite your mates round and spend all day naked mud-wrestlingI was you. Remember – Hands – Face – Cake – Bottle – Conga.” But they insisted we absolutely had to stay alone, while they did the opposite. Andyou were cynical, you might suspect thatthey lie so blatantly about that, maybe it’s possible that they lie about everything  as well.

Labour accused the government of “chaos and incompetence” after waiting since November for the Government to publish the papers. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has until Monday to publish minutes and notes from a meeting between Health Minister Lord Bethell and testing firm Randox.At the time, ministers said they had been “unable to locate” the notes from the meeting.Randox, which has donated £, to the Conservative Party - as well as paying disgraced former MP Owen Paterson £, a year for advice - secured government testing deals at the height of the pandemic. Meanwhile, it emerged ex-health minister Lord Bethell had to call in experts from Facebook to help him try to find WhatsApp messages linked to lucrative contracts. The government told a High Court judge in August the texts had been lost because Lord Bethell replaced his phone. But official records released this week show Lord Bethell met with a representative of Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, to discuss message retention the following month. In November, the Commons passed a motion ordering the Department for Health and Social Careto publish details of the meeting. Mr Javid confirmed work was underway to gather, review and prepare details of the meeting - and set a deadline of Monday for publication.Labour chair Anneliese Dodds “It’s been months since the Government promised to publish the minutes of the infamous closed-doors meeting between Randox, Owen Paterson and Lord Bethell over the award of a hundred-million pound Covid contract.“This should have been straightforward, but instead the government is on course to break another promise and draw more questions about their lack of transparency. “It’s another example of the chaos and incompetence that is paralysing this Conservative Government while millions of families face a cost-of-living crisis.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppConservative PartyLord BethellOwen PatersonBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The row casts fresh doubt on the PMaposs integrity as he waits for the results of Sue Grayaposs report into Downing Street parties. Sir Philip, the Foreign Officeaposs permanent under-secretary, initially told the committee that Mr Casey had not received any correspondence about the PMaposs involvement.But leaked emails, published by the BBC, show Mr Casey asked an official to seek clear guidance for us from No  asap on what they would like us to do in the case.Sir Philip has now written to the committeeaposs chairman Tom Tugendhat to apologise for giving inadvertently inaccurate answers. But he said that on the day the email was sent, Nigel was almost entirely focused, in his role as Gold in our crisis response, on the terrorist threat to the evacuation. Labouraposs Chris Bryant, who sits on the committee, said: “The disaster of our withdrawal from Afghanistan requires the highest level of scrutiny. Parliament can only do thisthere is transparency from Government. “Since we published internal Foreign Office emails earlier this week, further emails have come to light that make it dficult to have confidence that we are getting full answers from the department.” The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year is being scrutinised by the Foreign Affairs Committee amid ongoing questions about the Governmentaposs handling of the crisis.  Sir Philip was criticised when he admitted he had stayed on holiday for nearly two weeks after Kabul fell to the Taliban. The-then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also failed toimmediately from a family holiday in Crete. The evacuation of animals looked after by the Nowzad charity sparked a major controversy as thousands of people trying to flee the Taliban were left behind. Downing Street has repeatedly denied intervening to help Mr Farthing, who was able to evacuate  cats and dogs from the country using a plane funded by donations raised in a high profile campaign But an email shared with MPs by whistleblower Raphael Marshall showed a Foreign Office official saying that the Prime Minister had authorised the animalsapos rescue.And the BBC reported another email from the same day saying then-foreign secretary Dominic Raab was seeking a steer from No  on whether to call Nowzad staff forward.Another email from Mr Casey showed him asking a security official to seek clear guidance for us from No  asap on what they would like us to do.  The emails to the Commons inquiry were submitted by Mr Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office at the time and alleges the animals were evacuated following an order from Mr Johnson.Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to downplay the dispute as fussing about a few animals.Downing Street sought to argue the officials in the first correspondence to be published may have been mistaken. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Itaposs not uncommon in Whitehall for a decision to be interpreted or portrayed as coming directly from the Prime Minister even when thataposs not the case, and itaposs our understanding thataposs what happened in this instance. We appreciate it was a frenetic time for those officials dealing with this situation. Mr Farthing submitted a five-page statement defending his actions to the committee, saying the animals were transported in the hold of the plane which is not safe for humans. He said the charity had offered seats on the plane to British evacuees but their offer was turned down by the Government.

The latest changes are advisory, so non-compliance will not result in a fine. A hierarchy of road users is also being introducedCyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads Image: Getty ImagesByNeil Lancefield:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |comments A major revamp of the Highway Code to boost protection for cyclists and pedestrians comes into force today amid concern millions of drivers are unaware of the changes.The new guidance means traffic should give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions. Cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of lanes on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions, to make themselves as visible as possible.A hierarchy of road users is also being introduced, meaning drivers will have more responsibility to watch out for people cycling, walking, or riding a horse, and cyclists will have more responsibility to be aware of pedestrians. Turning traffic should now give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.  And motorists will be encouraged to adopt the so-called ‘Dutch Reach’, opening the door next to them with the opposite hand so they look over their shoulder, meaning they’re more likely to spot and less likely to injure passing cyclists and pedestrians. The Highway Code contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads. Nine sections have been updated, with  rules added or amended. The changes are advisory, so non-compliance will not result in a fine. AA president Edmund King expressed concern at the potential impact of the guidance to give way to pedestrians at junctions. He suggested that drivers are “likely to get hit by another vehicle from behind”they stop on dual carriageways or fast-flowing A roads to let someone cross. He also warned that pedestrians could be endangeredone vehicle gives way but another travelling in the opposite direction fails to stop.  “Drivers will have to make their own judgments on what they should do in the scenarios they find themselves in,” Mr King said. “However,the judgments of the driver and the pedestrian are at odds on a very busy road, this could lead to problems.” An AA survey of more than , drivers carried out earlier this month indicated that % were unaware of the changes. A communications drive will be launched by the Department for Transport’s road safety offshoot Think! in mid-February, with further activity later in the summer. Roads minister Baroness Vere said this week that the updated Highway Code will make Britain’s roads safer and encourage people to “respect and consider the needs of those around them”. Charity Cycling UK said the changes must be “communicated with simple, accurate and memorable messaging”.  of the major changes . Hierarchy of road users A new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users. . Walking, cycling or riding in shared spaces Cyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths. . Positioning of cyclists Cyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions. . Pedestrians crossing at junctions Turning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions. Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings. . Overtaking cyclists Drivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists. They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds. . Opening car doors Car occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder. This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists. . Overtaking cyclists at junctions When cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise. . Cycling in groups People cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups. .

Ex-detectives and former criminal QCs and profilers are in demand to appear at events looking at infamous murders and unsolved cases. And with ticket prices regularly ranging from £ to £, it seems that crime really does pay. At CrimeCon UK , audiences will meet a whole host of law enforcement experts from ex-DCI Colin Sutton – who helped snare serial killer Levi Bellfield – to former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who brought the Rochdale child sex gang to justice.Organisers say Netflix, BBC and ITV dramas recounting some of the UK’s most notorious crimes have fuelled a huge surge in public interest. And they believe the two-day event in London in June could shed fresh light on thousands of unsolved murders.  CrimeCon’s Nancy Baughen said: “There is a global rise in crime fascination. It’s driven by armchair sleuths, especially women, and propelled by the popularity of true crime programmes. “There is no other event in the UK that brings fans and followers of this genre closer to leading crime experts.” Forensic psychologist Kerry Daynes, ex-detective Mark Williams-Thomas and BBC Inside Justice’s Louise Shorter are among the names on the bill. As is Marie McCourt, , who fought for Helen’s Law in her murdered daughter’s name to stop killers from being releasedthey refuse to say where they have hidden bodies.

The pair both went to St Andrews University in Scotland and threw themselves into student le. This meant visiting the townaposs famous student haunts, where Kate reportedly often saw Prince William getting hit on by girls while they were out partying together. Although they werenapost an item at the time, Kate was close to the prince - and even came up with a clever trick to help him out when things got a bit awkward with members of the opposite sex.  Speaking to royal expert Katie Nicholl for her book Kate: The Future Queen, their friend Laura Warshauer said: Will was getting really hit on by this girl at a party and it was getting quite uncomfortable because he couldnapost shake her off. He was being really polite, but this girl just didnapost get the hint. All of a sudden Kate came up behind him and put her arms around him.

He said aposOh, sorry, but Iaposve got a girlfriendapos, and he and Kate went off giggling. William was very grateful for her help, and according to Laura, he mouthed thanks so much to her afterwards. She said: Kate was the only girl in the room who could have done that. And that was just a month after we started university. However, Kate and William didnapost stay friends for very long - thataposs because their close bond eventually blossomed into romance.  The pair began dating - staying together throughout their university days and after their graduation. In , Kate and William briefly split and sources later said the Queen was disappointed by the break-up. But the split seemed to be short-lived as weeks later, William and Kate were seen kissing at an army party at barracks in Bovington, Dorset. And in July , Kate and her brother James were seen at the Concert for Diana, held at Wembley to mark  years since William’s mother Princess Dianaaposs death. It wasn’t long before their romance was confirmed to be back on, and Kate moved into William’s Clarence House flat, where he wouldfrom military duties on Friday nights for cosy weekends together - and the rest they say is history. Theyaposve now been married almost  years and have three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

And for girls, the list includes Bertha, Beverley, Carol, Carole, Doreen, Gail, Gertrude, Gillian, Glenys, Glynis, Hilary, Jeanette, Jill, Kay, Kerry, Lesley, Lindsay, Lyndsey, Lynne, Lynsey, Mandy, Maureen, Muriel, Phyllis.

Meanwhile, for boys, there were hardly any in  named Barry, Cecil, Clarence, Claude, Clford, Cyril, Dale, Donald, Gary, Garry, Glen, Glenn, Gordon, Graham, Howard, Keith, Leslie, Neville, Norman, Rodney, Stewart, Stuart and Trevor. Speaking about the findings, Ted Mentele, Editor in Didactics at Babbel, said: Naming practices form the basis of all language as well as the basis of identity. The fact that the etymological roots of these names can be traced back to dferent languages and cultures from around the world shows how languages have impacted on each other over time. We hope that by drawing attention to the overlooked roots and intriguing meanings of these endangered names, we can give them a new lease of le for the next generation, and save them from being forgotten.” While Dr Harry Parkin, Editor of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain, added: “Exactly why certain names become especially frequent and why certain names die out is very complex. Sometimes, certain vocabulary will be used because it is seen as prestigious.Popular culture is certainly a relevant aspect. Or, certain vocabulary might be used in certain groups and communities. Vocabulary useis therefore linked with a sense of identity. The Norman Conquest then had aconsiderable impact on the given name stock of England.

Shannon Turnbull, , noticed bizarre symptoms such as a tingling sensation and changes to her vision at the start of the year.But when the left side of her body went numb and she was rushed to AE, she was shocked to learn that she had the degenerative condition, Multiple Sclerosis .The mum of two had initially thought she was suffering from a trapped nerve, but after  hours in hospital was without almost allin her left leg.Speaking to EdinburghLive : Around three and a bit weeks now I started to develop what I could only describe as sensitivity on my skin on my back on the lower left side.  To touch it hurt, to even have my clothes on it would hurt, even the temperature affected this. I thought maybe I’d pulled a muscle, I’m sure it’ll sort itself out. As the days went on it got worse, it was rapidly spreading to my tummy. I still didn’t think much of it and was waiting for it to just disappear. I started to develop extreme numbness on the affected areas and as more days went by it was spreading down my leg. By Monday just gone, my lower left back, tummy and thigh were completely numb. I felt asI’d had an epidural! Sharon, who is a mum to her sons, Tommy and Louis, is now learning to walk again with theof just one leg. She said: I visited my doctor and got some blood tests and referred to a neurologist for an appointment in a couple of weeks. She said to contact themsymptoms got any worse. Tuesday morning I woke up and my leg was extremely weak, the numbness had covered my full leg and I wasn’t able to walk as well. The doctor sent me straight up to AE, where I underwent multiple MRI and brain scans. After spending  hours staying in hospital and almost complete loss of my left legI was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. MS is a lelong condition that affects the brain and nervous system. It is caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking your brain and nerves. Multiple Sclerosis cannot be cured. The moment I was made aware of my diagnosis I knew instantly my le would be changed forever. Within days of her shock diagnosis, Shannon explained her le has already changed dramatically. The family has overhauled their routine and are even having to move to a new home specially adapted to her needs. As well as the physical aspects of the condition, Shannon must now mentally come to terms with her diagnosis, for which there is no cure. She said: Last Saturday I was running around in the soft play with my boys and this Saturday I canapost even walk. Why is le so unfair  The hardest thing to deal with has definitely been the loss of my left leg . Iaposve been walking since I was one and at the age of  Iaposm now having to reteach my leg how to walk again, which is very frustrating and tiring.

Recently a friend of mine was slowly cycling up the long hill back to his home when a white van raced inches past him. The displaced air of the vehicle caused him to almost topple into the gutter and his heart to pound as he frantically corrected his balance. Understandably enraged, my friend yelled swear words at the rapidly disappearing back license plate as the motor raced up the hill. Suddenly the van came to a screeching halt and the glass and metal barrier that usually separates drivers and cyclists was broken. A man with a beetroot red face and fury in his eyes slammed his boots onto the tarmac, letting out a war cry as he raced towards my two-wheeled pal and flung a foot forwards. It connected with the back of the bike and smashed the rear light.  As little red pieces of plastic sprinkled onto the road below, the righteous driver explained in no-uncertain and spittle-flecked terms that my friend should have been in the bike lane, despite one not existing, and then he should f*** off. Depending on where you sit on the binary ide of drivers and cyclists, you will want this story to finish in one of two ways. Drivers will of course be hoping that the van man properly lands a follow up blow, causing my arrogantly peddling pal to tumble onto the ground to uproarious laughter from the assembled motorists.Cyclists will be hoping that the driver follows in the footsteps of the Reading Road Rage Warrior, whose momentous fall as he vainly chased after a fleeing Lycra-lad was filmed and viewed million times.Whether or not youaposre disappointed to find out that my friend managed to race off to safety, the encounter is one of many which makes clear there is some bad blood between dferent kinds of road users. For the car drivers, the fear of clipping a cyclist as they race through crawling traffic is a sincere and blood pressure raising one. The rage directed towards people peddling two-abreast is just as earnestly felt. For the bike rider, peddling beside a one-tonne hunk of metal on British roads that claimed  cyclistsapos lives and seriously injured , more in  is scary. Unfortunately for those who associate with the former camp, they are in the wrong. Britain used to be a beautul land of rolling green hills, pristine meadows teeming with le and country paths adorned by luscious hedgerows. Since production of the motorcar began in the early th century that beauty has been under constant attack, slowly chipped away in service of the car. Now huge motorways rip through the countryside. Car parks and business zones surround towns gutted of their once vibrant centres. Primary school children are choked by exhaust fumes. As a nation we made a grave mistake when we decided to build our society around personal transport pods rather than building on the early glory of our public transport infrastructure. We didnapost know then that tens of billions of pounds of roads built each decade would not be enough to cope with the staggering demand for motors. We didnapost know then of the catastrophic toll fossil fuels have on the environment. But because the driver feels safe in their metal castle - warm and separate from society and its problems - we bent our country to them. For decades cars and motorists have been the dominant forces on British highways. They are the fastest, the least vulnerable and by far the most plentul. Today the Government has gone some way to right that historic wrong. Changes to the Highway Code that come into force today give power back to the cyclist - a road user who requires a fraction of the tarmac of the driver, is all but emission free and a statistically lower burden on the NHS. The headline change is that cyclists should now ride in the centre of quiet roads, and keep at least . metres away from the kerb edge on busy tracks with fast moving vehicles. They can also ride two-abreast, so long as theyaposre considerate and let motors overtake when itaposs safe to do so, and pass slow or stationary cars either on the right or left. The upshot of this, and a new hierarchy of road users which puts pedestrians and cyclists up the top - as the least dangerous to others - and HGV drivers at the bottom, is greater protection for people on bikes, and more responsibility for those behind the wheel. Whether or not these changes calm the boiling tension between driver and cyclist in the long run, and enshrine what has long been known to be best practice legally, what is clear is that the cleated shoe is now on the other foot. Car drivers have been demoted to secondary citizens on the highways, and cyclists are now kings of the road. And so they should be.

He denies wrongdoing. After losing his roles, his social media pages were deletedPrince Andrews portrait has been taken down at three HQsBySean Rayment:,  Jan Prince Andrew’s portrait has been taken down by regiments he once led. The move at three HQs is yet another sign of the Duke of York being airbrushed from public le. It follows the decision to strip Andrew of his  forces titles as he battles a US sex abuse civil case. Andrew strongly denies wrongdoing. But after losing his roles, his social media pages were deleted and his section on the royal website edited. A senior defence chief said today: “This is yet more evidence of the duke’s fall from grace.” Sources say pictures and paintings of the duke dressed in military finery have been removed from the officers’ and sergeants’ messes of the Grenadier Guards, the Royal Irish Regiment, The Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Royal Lancers.  He is no longer toasted at regimental dinners and all links with units he once represented have been axed. Our source added: “The duke has been the master of his downfall. “His inability to accept ­sensible advice shows a real sense of detachment.” One member of the Royal Irish Regiment said: “There is enormous relief. His ­association had become an embarrassment.”  Some regiments have also signalled to Buckingham Palace that they want a say in which royal becomes the next colonel in chief. A source said: “This must be a once in a letime event. We want someone who will stay the course.” Regiments have written to serving and former members informing them that Prince Andrew has been stripped of the rank of colonel in chief.  The Grenadier Guards were told the colonelcy had been ed to the Queen “with immediate effect”. The letter, from Lieutenant General Roly Walker, went on: “I am sure you will all offer a personal ‘Three Cheers’ for the Colonel, an appointment She first held in .” He added: “Buckingham Palace have informed me that the Colonelcy, along with the duke’s other titles and affiliations, will be reallocated to another member of the Royal Family, but claried it will not be ed to The Duke of York.”  Once hailed a Falklands war hero, Andrew is being sued in New York by Virginia Giuffre, , for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was .

The rooms, the gardens, the views and even the smells will remind her of the good times she’s had there, but the people she shared them with are gone. Loch Lomond is the special place where Colin and I enjoyed our special times. Each year I’d askhe’d like to have a holiday in Portugal or Loch Lomond, and he always chose Scotland. We loved everything about our trips there, from the long drive with our Motown music, Scotch eggs and tin of travel sweets. We’d always stop at Tebay services which has beautul scenery, turkey pie to die for and a farm shop.  We stayed in a cosy lodge, where even a cup of tea or a Chinese takeaway seemed to taste nicer. We’d walk in the wilderness for miles, spotting red deer, and we’d end up at little tea shops where it would have been rude not to order cake. Sometimes we’d drive to explore the surrounding areas and we’d get lost, in the days before sat nav, but somehow always found a warm, friendly pub. Colin loved the gentle pace and peace of our holidays there. And I adored how everything about the place made us both feel so relaxed and happy. I get a little tearful when Loch Lomond appears on television. Then I remind myself I was lucky to have had such fantastic times there.  Bloominapos solo birthday While Boris had a party for his birthday, I spent mine alone. My two sons bought me flowers and left them at the end of the drive because we wouldn’t have dreamt of breaking the social distance laws. I am too tired to be angry. Listening to all the political rows has left me weary and drained. Instead, I just wish all sides of the political spectrum would get their heads together and get our country up and running again.  Drama a real blast It can be hard to stay awake in January when it’s a long, grey, damp anticlimax. But an explosion scene in the new TV series Trigger Point made me jump out of my skin. My eyes popped so wide I felt more awake than I had in weeks.  Loo are you talking to  Fancy new research says lots of British phrases are no longer used because the younger generation are baffled by them. What a load of codswallop. Whoever did the survey needs to listen to my daily chat with my friend Beryl because we use such phrases constantly. I say this as a woman who still calls those sweets Opal Fruits and will never say Starburst. So here’s my guide to those sayings which have got young people’s knickers in a twist. Flogging a dead horse means there’s no point in arguing any more - that’s what I say whenever I’m giving our Robert a talking-to because he never he pays any notice. I’m fit for the knacker’s yard means every bit of me is falling to pieces and no use to anyone, which is how I describe myself these days.  Dropping a clanger is a less posh way of saying committing a faux pas - something my friends say I do every day. No wonder no one understands that ‘spend a penny’ means going to the loo because they usually cost a pound now. And a dog’s dinner is what I create each time I try cooking. But I have no idea where ‘daft as a brush’ comes from - or why my friends use it whenever they talk about me. Bobsleigh, the coolest sport The Australian Open tennis has turned my body clock upside down because I’m glued to the coverage. Soon I’ll be riveted by the Beijing Olympic Winter Games. The bobsleigh is my favourite. Me and my friend Janet reckonwe could get in one we’d shoot down faster than anyone . But we’d laugh so hysterically there’d need to be room in my skin-tight race suit for a Tena Lady.If you’d like to write to Val, please email features@mirror or write to Val Savage, PO Box , E DD The Mirror makes a donation to the Alzheimer’s Society in lieu of payment. alzheimersRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Novak DjokovicPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRobbie SavageAustralian OpenWinter Olympic GamesRoyal FamilyMental healthPrice risesAlzheimers diseaseBobsledDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We saw scores on phones, with some emailing, messaging and even watching TikTok videos.Footage was captured by our guide Mike van Erp, a road safety campaigner whose own father was killed by a drink-driver. Since , Mike has reported , drivers including Guy Ritchie and Chris Eubank. Offenders get a police warning letter and in some cases, prosecution, points and bans. I joined Mike – a carer and dad of two – on the afternoon school run in Hyde Park, London.  Mike, who has , followers online, tells us: “I cross the roads on foot, with my kids and a boy with Down’s syndrome I care for, and I notice how many drivers are fiddling on phones. I’m afraid for him and for my own kids.” Seventeen people died in crashes involving drivers distracted by phones in , latest figures show. Mike’s father Coen, , was killed in Harare, Zimbabwe. Dutchman Mike, who grew up there, says: “I rode out there and saw the wrecked car, a mangled heap of dirty metal, my dad’s body in a blanket.  “I am determined to help others not have to experience such a road death and I’ve realised, through many studies, mobile phone use is worse than drink driving, and that the effects of the heavy mental investment in a remote conversation are much stronger than many realise.”Inside a minute of me joining Mike, we see a BMW driver on the phone. Mike’s £ GoPro, attached to his head, catches her using WhatsApp and email.“I think that’s probably gold standard evidence, I’ll submit that one,” he says.  Soon, we catch a -something man on his phone in his Audi. “He was watching a TikTok video,” Mike says. Broadcaster Jeremy Vine cycles by and declares himself a “big fan” of Mike, telling us: “He’s making the world safer. I love this guy.” We see the driver of a Range Rover taking photos, another scrolling through a playlist and three sending messages. Drivers of expensive cars such as Range Rovers and Teslas are common offenders, Mike says. He regularly sees parents messaging while driving kids.  Celebrity offenders Mike identies get him in the news. Film director Ritchie, , was banned for six months after Mike caught him texting. Former boxer Eubank, , got three penalty points after Mike filmed him running a red light while texting. Mike has been attacked, trolled and even threatened with death by other drivers. But he says: “I had a tough upbringing, so physical danger doesn’t give me much fear.”- Follow Mike at Youtube c cyclingmikeyPhones totally banned We ventured out with Mike three days before new Highway Code rules banned drivers using a phone in any circumstance. The rules apply to drivers stuck in traffic and at red lights – and offenders could face six points on their licences and a £ fine. If a driver has passed their test in the two years before the offence, they will lose their licence. The shake-up prioritises cyclists and pedestrians, with motorists advised to use the Dutch Reach to open the vehicle’s door from inside. This means drivers using their furthest hand from the door to open it, as this forces the body to swivel around, helping to see a cyclist, pedestrian or another vehicle coming from behind.  It is also now acceptable for cyclists to ride in the centre of the road, in some situations. And they are not obliged to use the cycle lane. Drivers who are overtaking cyclists must leave at least . metres of space at up to mph, moredriving faster.

Met Office says road, rail, air and ferry services are likely to be affected, leading to longer journey times and some cancellations. Some roads and bridges likely to close too.There is also a good chance power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage, forecasters say. The storm will slowly move south, asdetails, and will impact the East Midlands and East of England by Monday evening. Storm Corrie will, meanwhile, bring a new spell of rainfall and gusts across Scotland in the middle of the week.  Today The amber weather warning is in place for eastern Scotland and northeast England throughout today. Met Office said: An area of very strong west or northwest winds will cross Scotland and notheast England on Saturday morning in association with Storm Malik before easing during the afternoon. The strongest winds are expected in the east of Scotland and northeast of England later in the morning. Gusts of widely - mph are likely with a short period of gusts in excess of  mph possible, particularly for Moray and north Aberdeenshire as well as the Lothians.  The amber warning covers central Scotland, Tayside  Fe, Grampian, southwest Scotland and the Lothian Borders. North East England is also covered, including Newcastle and Northumberland. A yellow weather warning is in place for all of Scotland, much of Northern Ireland and parts of northern England today for wind too. Met Office added: An area of strong winds will cross Scotland, parts of Northern Ireland and some northern counties of England on Saturday morning before easing during the afternoon. Gusts of widely - mph are expected and there is a chance of a brief period of gusts in excess of  mph in places, particularly for parts of eastern Scotland later in the morning.  Met Officeaposs chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: “The impacts of Storm Malik are going to be greatest in Denmark on Sunday, but the track of the storm in the preceding hours means that the UK will be dealt a glancing blow as Malik moves eastwards on Saturday. “For those in the north of the UK there will be high winds and rain on Saturday, with showers possibly turning wintry in the high ground in the north. The highest winds are expected in exposed coastal areas in the north and east of Scotland, but it will be a windy day for most.” Sunday The yellow weather warning remains in place throughout Sunday for all of Scotland, most of northeast England, northwest England and parts of Northern Ireland and north Wales. Travel disruption is likely in these spots, and the weather will generate some large and dangerous waves around the coasts. Met Office said road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible.  Injuries and danger to le could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto susceptible sea fronts, coastal roads and properties, forecasters added. Gusts could reach up to mph in hilly and coastal areas, including along the North Sea shore. Met Office continued: On Sunday evening a spell of strong northwesterly winds is likely to develop across western Scotland, and then progress southeastwards eventually easing away from the North Sea coastlines during Monday morning. The strongest wind gusts will mostly occur around the coastlines and over the hills. Monday Sundayaposs yellow weather warning - and the areas subject to it - will remain throughout Monday too. Met Office said: Thereaposs a small chance that a very limited part of the area could see a short period of more damaging gusts, that could reach -mph inland, and -mph around exposed coasts and hills. Temperatures will remain in single figures on Monday. Agostinho Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine, has urged Britons to remind elderly neighbours to heat their homes. “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections. “Remind vulnerable relatives and neighbours to heat their home to at least C – particularlythey have reduced mobility, are  or older, or have a health condition. “Should they need to go outside, it’s important for them to wear shoes with a good grip.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeWeatherWeather warning\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Almost , businesses have stopped trading or gone into administration after taking taxpayer-funded cash to help them in the pandemic.The staggering sum is on top of the £.billion extracted by fraudsters from the emergency Covid schemes like furlough and Eat Out To Help Out.The new details emerged after the minister for counter-fraud, Lord Agnew, resigned in anger at the Government’s inability to tackle scams. The Insolvency Service said it had identied , companies in England, Wales and Scotland that became insolvent between last May and October after getting a Bounce Back loan.  The bank loans, which were fully guaranteed by the Government, were intended to compensate firms for reduced trade during lockdowns. Bosses could apply for up to £, or % of annual turnover. Banks were ordered to ease the usual checks. Many borrowers self-certied financial status. The scheme provided £.billion in credit through . million loans. It is not clear how much the Government will recover. But as the banks will get the dud loans refunded by Government – in other words the taxpayer – it is likely other creditors will get priority.  A government source said the average loan was well below £, and the Bounce Back scheme had been a leline to over ,, firms. A spokesman added: “Businesses are expected to make every effort to repay loans. Most payments are being made as expected.” The Treasury – blasted by Lord Agnew as “having no knowledge or little interest” in fraud – has written off £.billion in Covid scams.

Nicolette Baker was diagnosed with Superior Mesenteric Artery syndromenearly a decade ago - a condition which means that her Superior Mesenteric artery is compressing on her duodenum and kidney -causing her unimaginable pain when she tries to eat.A -year-old says eating something as small as a jelly baby feels like sheaposs aposfinished off a Christmas dinner apos and makes her intestine feel like itaposs aposgoing to burstapos.Over the years she had been misdiagnosed as anorexic and even force-fed, as her weight has dwindled to a terrying st. In March last year doctors told her she had aposdays to liveapos, meaning they would only offer her palliative care.  But defiant Nicolette wants to live and has already raised £, towards £, for surgery in Germany to relieve the pressure and pain her artery is causing. Nicolette said: The surgery is booked but I need to pay for the weeks Iaposll be spending in intensive care afterwards because my health is so poor. There’s only two weeks to go I’m really determined to keep going. I used to thinkI’m going to die I’m going to die but things have changed. Now I’ve actually been told I’m dying I don’t just want to surrender to that, I want to live and give something back to society.After being given days to live Nicolette became determined to defy doctorsapos predictions and earlier this month set up a GoFundMe where she opened up about how she is aposliterally starving to deathapos. Although Nicolette only received her diagnosis seven years ago, doctors believe she was born with the condition. Nicolette can recall having issues with her digestive system from as young as four years old, but it wasnapost until her late s that she would understand what was happening to her. She said: Eating a jelly baby feels like I’ve finished off a full Christmas dinner. As that jelly baby passes through my intestine the pain is incredible. It feels like a hose pipe with a blockage in it to the point where it is going to burst. She added: I remember throwing up liquid milk at four years old. I was just labelled as anorexic but when I eat it causes me so much pain.  The less I ate the less pain I’d have so I ended up losing quite a bit of weight and it was deemed to be a mental health problem.I was an inpatient at hospitals for years and I was force fed which only made the problem worse and caused me even more pain.The condition has completely robbed Nicolette of her le - she has been unable to start a family, have a career and was even forced to give up her beloved -year-old whippet, Eden. She said: I have always dreamed of my prince charming coming on a white horse but I don’t think that will happen. I had to give up my beloved dog because I couldn’t manage him anymore. The first thing I will do when Iaposve had the surgery is get him back. Before her health declined, Nicolette had worked part time in a hospice, until she could no longer even manage that - meaning she has no savings of her own to fall back on.  Now, as the condition holds her on the brink of death, it is a race against time to raise the final £, needed so she has secured her follow up treatment after her surgery on February . She said It would mean everything to raise the last £, I need so I donapost have that pressure hanging over me. Iaposm struggling with my breathing, my whole system is shutting down one by one. Iaposm desperate to make it through just so I can thank all the people who have so generously helped me get to this point. Nicolette will fly out on February  for preliminary scans ahead of the surgery at the end of the month.

Sharon Kollmar, from Long Island, New York, claims she was desperate to extend her family and have a baby with her fiance, Gus, , who is already a granddad. Sharon, , already has an -year-old son, Aiden, from a previous relationship, but always wanted more kids.After almost a decade of being single, she had started to look into sperm donors. But while explaining her quest to lelong friend and now fiancé, Gus, he suggested that the pair should strike up a relationship and try for a baby together. They ended up having to spend £,on an egg donor and IVF - they welcomed their daughter, Bayleigh Emerson, in September . Sharon said: I so desperately wanted more kids. People thought I was crazy for wanting to start all over again. Iaposd been to see fertility doctors who were dismissive because of my age and told me that although I still had eggs, the chances of me falling pregnant were slim. I was also still single. I was talking to my male friend about everything and out of the blue he said aposwhat about me apos Iaposd never even thought about it before but it seemed like a great idea. He had always been in my and my sonaposs le. So we started dating, and because I was around  and he was , we started trying to conceive straight away. We were trying for two years and hadnapost fallen pregnant, so we looked into donor embryos but the cut off age was . So we turned to donor eggs and found someone who matched my colourings and had fresh eggs, rather than frozen. The process cost us , and I went through rigorous physical testing and preparation. In January , when Sharon was , she underwent the embryo transfer which was successful on the first attempt. When she finally received the doctoraposs call confirming she was pregnant, she says it was the moment she had been waiting for for over a decade. Sharon and Gus, who is already a dad to his -year-old daughter and grandfather to her three children, welcomed their new addition on September , .Sharon added: My pregnancy was pretty textbook, although the baby was bigger this time around so I felt it a little more.But I love being pregnant. People couldnapost understand why we would want another baby at the age of  and . My friendsapos kids were graduating college and getting married. Some of my friends were even grandparents. Gus is even a grandfather and his daughter is . His grandkids are ,  and . So people had a hard time getting their head around it, but it meant the world to us. Sharon gave birth via C-section as there was meconium in her fluids and baby Bayleigh had flipped over out of the ideal delivery position. Sharon claims doctors also incorrectly predicted she would weigh lbs but she was born at a healthy lbs z. She said: Holding her in my arms was incredible. I love having a newborn. It is just as rewarding and satisfying as the first time. I think people thought I would regret it, but I would not change it for the world. When we brought her home and I placed her in my sonaposs arms, his eyes filled with tears and he told her that he had been waiting for her his entire le. It was so special.

Sharon added: I want to give hope to people who thought their chance at parenthood was over. You need to have faith and live your own le, and not what your family and friends expect you to do. Just because you are a bit older, it doesnapost mean the door is shut.  People said was that it wasnapost fair to bring a child into the world at our age because we likely wouldnapost be alive to see them into adulthood or that weaposd be an embarrassment as old parents. But itaposs better to be born to old parents than not at all, and there is no guarantee that a -year-old that has a baby will see that child into adulthood as illnesses and accidents happen all the time. I always knew that I was going to have more children, even though I wasnapost sure how but I just knew that somehow it would all piece together and it has. I couldnapost be happier.

But thanks to a tip from a driving school TikTok account named Driving Test Success @drivingtestsuccess, we no longer need to suffer in the freezing cold before we head to work, as it turns out you can actually get rid of the ice from inside your car as itaposs warming up. Experts at Driving Test Success say you can clear ice cover by simply activating your car windscreen fan, which will heat up the glass from the inside and help to melt the frost, the Express reports. In the companyaposs video, they explained: “Frozen windscreen  Put the temperature on high.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “Put the front windscreen fan on max. The ice will start to melt from the heat. Wipe away excess water andthe fan to normal. While the tip might seem obvious to some seasoned drivers, several commenters on the video who were new to driving couldnapost believe theyaposd never seen the hack before. One commenter said: Wow, magic! The ice is gone. And another praised the account for all their help, as they wrote: Iaposve learnt so much thanks to your app!  But others were less impressed, as one TikTok user shunned the idea, stating: Wastes more fuel. Just get [out] and scrape it off you lazy so and so.” Driving Test Success is far from the first account to point out the easy de-icing trick either, as another video online from Clear View Driving said road users should use their demister before they start driving. They said: “Now donapost use your windscreen wipers or washers as that wonapost help. Turn on your front and rear demister. “The rear demister also heats up your side mirrors in most new cars. Butthe mirrors are not clear, make sure to clear them before you start driving. “Then, once itaposs done you can use your wipers.” And in the cold winter months, the AA has also encouraged road users to “turn on the warm air blower” and “heated mirrors” to clear frost cover quickly and safely.They explained: “Start the engine and turn on the warm air blower on the windscreen. Switch on the rear windscreen heater and heated mirrors,you have them. Turn on the air-con. Itaposs not just for summer – itaposll remove moisture from the air to stop the car from misting up. “Don’t use your hands to wipe misted-up windows – youaposll leave greasy smears and a diamond ring could scratch the glass.

This is because everyone can see it and as such, thereaposs a chance it will affect your future career prospects, not to mention the possibility of it going wrong and you being unable to cover it up.

Nikki had created a video to show off her transition contact lenses, but her face tattoo distracted viewers. Am I the only one that is seeing lines on her  one asked. Girl I thought you were turning into a vampire with the lines on your forehead and using the word apostransitionapos, joked another. It isn’t clear enough ma’am, that’s why everyone was asking, commented a third. Nikki received so many questions about her forehead tattoo, she created another video to explain the situation.  That video had a lot of people asking about my forehead - apparently it wasn’t clear enough that it’s a tattoo, she began. I tattooed it in grey wash so that it would have more of a shadowed effect. I did do it on myself. I’m a professional licensed tattooer of  years plus and I’ve had it for going on five years now. I wouldn’t recommend tattooing your own face unless you are confident to achieve what you want. She also explained that the design was inspired by the underside of a mushroom. I really liked how organic and wavy the lines were - some of them were shorter and some of them were longer, so that’s kind of the inspiration for this - the waviness, the organic flow of them is all intended, she said. But yeah it’s probably one of my absolute favourite tattoos. I have a seamless bodysuit - every inch of me pretty much is tattooed and it’s almost complete. But out of all of them, I love my little forehead crown tattoo. She added that the inking is not faded, contrary to popular opinion - it just looks dferent depending on how the light hits it. Her followers flocked to show their support, as one wrote: I think itaposs gorgeous and going with the underside of a mushroom is amazing but the most important thing is that you love it.

He previously ate a plant-based diet but claimed to suffer from health issues because of it. So instead, heaposs been training his stomach to digest nothing but uncooked meat, including organs and he washes it down with raw animal milk and raw eggs. He claims his favourite meals include chicken breast, steak and swordfish and so far heaposs managed to avoid severe food poisoning. But worryingly he is risking contracting E. coli, salmonella and Shigella.Getthe newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.He also faces further health issueshe fails to eat fruit and vegetables, including constipation, haemorrhoids and even scurvy.Posting stomach-churning photos of himself biting into raw flesh, the man has amassed a following online as they wait to see the effects of his bizarre diet. His Instagram page @therawmeatexperiment has .k followers, and the bio explains: Eating raw meat at Whole Foods every day until I die from bacteria SeeingI Live for  days or  years.  His aposcavemanapos diet has also seen him tuck into cow liver and camel milk and tearing into a steak with his teeth. No chewing involved, you can basically just place the cow flesh in your mouth and swallow it, he explained. Pretty tasty, half the cost of a steak, will probably be a weekly meal along with cod. Asked by a follower how he was feeling, he confirmed: Good, I like it so far and feel no reason to stop, no crazy changes either way though. On his th day, he revealed he was able to eat lb of mince in just five minutes - one of his favourites.  A brick of shredded cow and milk of the sheep. Ground beef has become my favourite meal, he said. Due to the low cost, ease of consuming a pound in like  minutes, gathering  calories of absorbable cow and digesting perfectly. He admitted cooked meat tastes a bit better though the raw stuff was growing on him. On day  he ate raw bacon, which one of his followers said looked like a skinned foot. For those concerned about how limited his diet is, he has explained he does occasionally eat potatoes, rice and cooked chicken. And heaposs claimed his pain has gone away since embarking on his new carnivorous diet. When I started eating steak and eggs for breakfast, instead of bagels and smoothies, I felt full for most of the day, and stable, instead of getting dizzy from a carb crash, my pain started to go away, he insisted. But doctors generally warn that eating a lot of raw meat is dangerousyou canapost be sure of the quality and what bacteria might be lurking beneath.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

One man who made sure he would stand out from the crowd was Jonathan Swt, who saw an opening for a position within the marketing department of Yorkshire-based printing specialists, Instantprint and decided to get creative with his application. The -year-old made his mark by recycling the companyaposs own flyers in a genius marketing stunt in the company car park - as he placed a flyer advertising his LinkedIn profile on every single car.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Marketing Manager Craig Wassell, who was doing the hiring for the position, noticed Jonathanaposs antics on CCTV when he was advised by security to take a closer look at what was going on. And he was so impressed that he decided to invite the man in for an interview. He said: When I looked out of the office window, I could already see that someone had been around leaving flyers on all the car windscreens, and upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the flyers more closely were, in fact, an application for the role I was hiring for. Naturally, we immediately invited Jonathan in for an interview. Craig also shared footage from the CCTV cameras, as well as a picture of the cars, on Twitter - where he admitted Jonathan has become the talk of the office thanks to his stunt. He wrote: We’ve been well and truly ‘flyered’ by a candidate applying for a #job in our marketing team. Every car in the car park is covered in flyers linking to the applicant’s LinkedIn profile! That’s definitely one way to stand out. He’s been the talk of the office since covering everyoneaposs cars in CVs. I love it when we get a #creativejobapplication. Instantprint received over  applications for the position, but thanks to Jonathanaposs stroke of creative genius, he became the lucky candidate to be offered the role and started his new job earlier this month. Craig added: “Jonathan’s application did more than grab my attention. It showed that he’d researched the brand and that he had the right attitude, creativity and sense of humour to fit the team perfectly. I can’t wait to see what ideas he brings to the table and to work with him in the future.” But Jonathan has admitted he canapost completely take credit for the idea, as he was inspired by a similar Instantprint employee who had bagged a position on the design team after having her photograph printed on the companyaposs roller banners. He said: “I remembered seeing Instantprint in the news a while back because a candidate had successfully applied for a design role by having her photograph printed on one of the company’s own roller banners, and thought ‘what a great idea!’ “I wanted my application to make a statement just like that one had and what better way than distributing  flyers with my face on around the company car park ” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The mortician gave a full confession when quizzed by copsMadeleine McCann disappeared in Praia da Luz, Portugal on May ,  Image: METROPOLITAN POLICE AFP via GettByJon ClarkePatrick HillNews Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case swapped child abuse images and depraved online messages with an undertaker. The mortician gave “a full confession” when quizzed by German police and admitted he was a “regular customer” of convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner. It is understood material he handed over to officers now forms part of evidence being used against Brueckner. The undertaker, also a convicted sex offender, cannot be named for legal reasons – but he has spoken to the makers of a new documentary about the case, being shown tomorrow night on German TV channel Sat.. The film’s lead investigator Jutta Rabe told the Sunday People: “I’m not sure what he paid but he confirmed they regularly swapped material, all of which he has handed over to detectives.  “We haven’t been able to confirmthey were business partners but he insisted he... has completely mended his ways.” The undertaker, who lives alone, said he was interviewed by the BKA – Germany’s FBI. Miss Rabe said: “He was given a choice, ‘You either admit it and help us then go into therapy or go to prison’. He chose co-operation.” She added: “He is terried of being attacked and horried of his family finding out.” Madeleine, three, vanished from an Algarve apartment in  while on holiday with her twin siblings and parents Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics. In , Brueckner shared a string of sick messages with the undertaker, including some about snatching and imprisoning a toddler. Brueckner talks about making films to “document exactly how she is tormented”. The horrying Skype conversation was found when Brueckner was arrested for molesting his girlfriend’s daughter. He is now behind bars for offences including the  rape of a US widow in Praia da Luz – where Madeleine vanished two years later. German prosecutors say they have “concrete” evidence against him – and he is their only suspect in Madeleine’s case. But they also fear Breuckner has committed at least five other sex crimes, including the rape of an Irish woman, who was attacked in her Portuguese apartment in . The film reveals German police made a huge breakthrough when they unearthed a “partial fingerprint” of Breuckner’s which was found in the Irish victim’s flat. In the documentary, German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters says he expects Brueckner to be charged with some of the crimes “imminently”.

It’s the nuclear-armed countryaposs seventh test this month which is a record for the state. The Japanese government said North Korea had launched a possible ballistic missile, while South Koreaaposs Joint Chiefs of Staff reported the launch of an unidentied projectile. The ballistic missile launch and the ones before it are a threat to our country, the region and the international community, Japanese government spokesperson Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a televised briefing.  This series of launches violate UN resolutions and we strongly protest this action by North Korea. Matsuno said thatthe projectile was a standard ballistic missile it is estimated to have reached an altitude of ,km, flown for  minutes, to a distance of km. It makes January the busiest ever for North Koreaaposs missile programme. Analysts say the country’s weapon tests are increasing and developing new capabilities despite strict sanctions and United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban the countryaposs ballistic missile tests. In an address ahead of the New Year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for bolstering the military with cutting edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.  Since then, North Korea has conducted a series of launches displaying a dizzying array of weapon types, launch locations, and increasing sophistication. From hypersonic missiles and long-range cruise missiles to missiles launched from railcars and airports, the tests highlight the nuclear-armed stateaposs rapidly expanding and advancing arsenal amid stalled denuclearisation talks. North Korea has not tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons since , but the countryaposs rulers suggested this month they could restart those activities.  Its latest launches included a test of two short-range ballistic missiles and their warheads on Thursday, and an update to a long-range cruise missile system was tested on Tuesday. The tests appear aimed at bolstering national pride ahead of several major North Korean holidays and sending a message of strength, said Le-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.The Kim regime hears external discussions of its domestic weaknesses and sees South Koreaaposs growing strength, he said.So it wants to remind Washington and Seoul that trying to topple it would be too costly. Pyongyang has defended the launches as its sovereign right of self defence. It says they are not directed at any specic country, but accused Washington and Seoul of having hostile policies”. Kim visited a munitions factory last week, where he called for an all-out drive to produce powerful cutting-edge arms”. He touted his devotion to smashing ... the challenges of the US imperialists and their vassal forces seeking to violate their right to self-defence, calling it the harshest-ever adversity”.

There were many contributing factors according to the sherf, some of which would have been avoided with the crystal clear benefit of hindsight.As the sherf noted, the owners took pride in their vessel, kept it well maintained and considered it to be a safe boat. They were managing it little dferently to many others up and down the Scottish coast.But, crucially, no stability rules applied to boats like the Nancy Glen at the time of the accident.Duncan MacDougall was an experienced fisherman who knew these waters well and,it could happen to his boat, there is an obvious need to raise awareness to prevent such devastating accidents in future."},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts january 28 2022","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Craignish Village Hall is to host a bike clinic.Bring your bike along to Craignish Village Hall on January  and have it looked over by qualied cycle technicians at socially-distanced workstations.The workshop is suitable for anyone wanting to learn how to keep their bike in good working order and to increase their basic cycle maintenance skills.Organisers hope balance bikes will be available for budding cyclists, as well as ebikes for adults to try.Tea and coffee will be provided and there is no need to book.This workshop is supported by Craignish Village Hall and the Corra Foundation in  collaboration with Act, The Ardrishaig Bothy and local Cycling UK project co-ordinator Joanne Clark.Unpaid carers in communities near Cairndow may soon be able to take a well-earned breather thanks to a scheme proposed by community enterprise Here We Are.The #sit-in# service would allow volunteers to sit with a cared-for person to give the carer a break, or perhaps the volunteer might simply drop in for a chat with someone living alone.Staff at Here We Are, based at Clachan beside the Tree Shop, are currently looking into how the scheme might work in Cairndow and Strachur and would like to hear from anyone who might benefit from this free community service.Contact Dot Chalmers or Fiona Campbell at Here We Are on  , or email mail@hereweare-uk for more information.Kilchrenan Primary School parents and education officials have decided to move its six pupils to Taynuilt from Valentine#s Day.Head teacher Graham Dickie is retiring and no-one is in line to replace him.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Taking these factors into consideration parents, in collaboration with the council, have decided to move pupils to Taynuilt from February .#A paper is being prepared for the Community Services Committee to outline the details and options moving forward.#Councillor Elaine Robertson said: #It is always very sad when a local school is no longer operational, both for the families and the community.

The trial has so far been testing two active drugs and more drugs will be added, in due course, while medicines that prove ineffective will be dropped.Dr Suvankar Pal, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, University of Edinburgh and Co-lead Investigator of MND-SMART, said, “Historically, you would have a two-armed trial that looks at one active drug against a placebo [dummy drug], but this trial design allows us to test many, many more active drugs simultaneously and therefore get a definitive answer [phase ] more quickly, which is a much more efficient way of doing things.”Doddie’s Foundation has a clear vision of a world free of motor neuron disease and was founded in response to his frustration at the lack of options given to MND patients – no effective treatment, no access to meaningful clinical trials and no hope.The aims of the Foundation are to raise funds to aid research into the causes of MND and investigate potential cures and to make grants to iniduals suffering from MND, to enable them to live as fulfilled a le as possible.Olivia Bird, Research and Grants Officer at My Name’ Doddie Foundation, said, “We are delighted to continue our involvement in this landmark trial in MND and it is brilliant to see what progress has been made, despite the challenges of working around a pandemic.“We are incredibly grateful to the trial teams across the UK who have shown commitment and enthusiasm to get the trial up and running, and to our supporters who have gone to extraordinary s to raise much needed funds.”.removeA £, grant was also awarded to Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate recruitment of patients in the northeast of England."},{"url":null,"title":"highway-code-changes-make-roads-safer-says-cycling-scotland","story":"CHANGES to the Highway Code have been welcomed by Cycling Scotland, the nation’s cycling organisation.The changes come into effect today and will impact all road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.Around , people took part in a consultation, with the UK government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy and enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.Among the many changes, cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of a lane on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions to make themselves as visible as possible.They can ride two abreast, as is already the case but must allow drivers behind them to overtakeit is safe to do so.Other key amendments include clearer guidance for drivers to leave a distance of at least . metres when overtaking cyclists, and there will also be a recommendation for car occupants to open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opening into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane and should allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout.Cyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.Christopher Johnson, Head of Education and Training, Cycling Scotland said: “We welcome the updates to the Highway Code as one of many actions needed to prevent people being seriously injured and killed on our roads in Scotland..remove“The new hierarchy of road users underpins the changes - those who can cause the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the risk to others: people driving will be responsible for ensuring people cycling, walking and wheeling are safe, while people cycling will be responsible for looking out for those walking and wheeling.“Many of the changes to the Highway Code are not new but are clarying or explaining existing rules. We encourage everyone to read the new guidance and follow it, whether you’re walking or wheeling, riding a bike or horse or driving a vehicle.“While good progress has been on road safety overall in the last decade, sadly still too many people are killed or seriously injured while walking or cycling”All road users are urged to study the new rules."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-mps-david-mundell-john-lamont-expenses-revealed","story":"THE two Borders MPs cost the taxpayer around £, last year, new figures reveal.Data on business and staffing costs for the financial year   has been published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority .And the figures show that Tweeddale representative David Mundell was the fourth most expensive MP in the UK, claiming £,. – up from £,. last year.Mr Mundell, of the Conservatives, spent around £, on staff wages, approximately £, on rent, and around £, on advertising and contact cards, according to the data.Meanwhile, he paid out more than £, on air travel, around £, on stationery and printing, and approximately £, on a working from home allowance.:Fears that new supermarket would hurt Galashiels laughable, says councillorIn response to the figures, Mr Mundell said: “The constituency I represent is one of the largest and most erse in the whole United Kingdom, stretching from the Scottish border to the Pentland Hills south of Edinburgh, and covering three separate council areas and three separate NHS health boards.“I try at all times to provide the best possible service to my constituents across the more than  inidual communities which make up my constituency and this necessarily involves a level of expenditure that other MPs, representing smaller, less complex constituencies, are not required to incur.”The Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale MP added: “COVID has made this all the more challenging, including expenditure on local newspaper advertising to help ensure constituents and businesses who have queries about how COVID regulations impact them, or how grants or other forms of support can be accessed, had my office contact details easily to hand.”:Police tasked to target inappropriate and dangerous parking in Borders townAccording to the IPSA data, the average cost of an MP in the UK was £,..removeThe figures show that fellow Westminster representative for the region John Lamont claimed £,. in  .Mr Lamont’s largest type of cost was around £, on staff wages, followed by £, on rent and £, on bought-in services.Meanwhile, the Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk spent approximately £, on advertising and contact cards, just under £, on air travel and around £, on a working from home allowance.Mr Lamont’s costs were up on the £,. recorded the year before.:Police appeal for information following reports of graffiti in SelkirkOn the data, he said: “During the last year, we have seen an unprecedented  per cent increase in the number of enquiries and requests for help from local residents.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should

However, the safety of staff and the public must be the priority and closures are understandableremedial works have to be completed to make the buildings safe.“That said, nobody will want to see these sites closed to the public any longer than absolutely necessary.“Therefore,it’s determined that additional resources are required to complete the work, I’ll be calling for the Scottish Government to step in and provide more funding.”Local businesses have also been affected due to the closures, with guests being left disappointed to find the sites closed or choosing not to visit at all.Christopher Hansen, co-owner of The Open Arms Hotel in Dirleton, said: “We do have a lot of people askthe castle is open I’m not sure it’s put people off coming to stay but sometimes people aren’t aware that it’s closed.“I don’t think it’s had an impact on losing business but certainly caused people disappointment.“You’ve got to take health and safety seriously but they should have been making sure that properties were of a safe upkeep that they could be used.”"},{"url":null,"title":"swastikas-among-graffiti-spotted-haddington-town-centre","story":"The graffiti was highlighted to the Courier by a member of the public last Thursday morning.Other vandalism, spotted near the town’s day centre, includes the words ‘No G’.The member of the public said: “It is sad but there are a small group of sad people doing this and ripping down the Covid posters – which I saw and reported – but it is especially bad that this is around the primary school and very young children.”"},{"url":null,"title":"best-worst-primary-schools-scotland-2022-league-table-released","story":"The Times released its ranking on Thursday, January , marking the second time that primary schools in Scotland have had their performances published on a school-by-school basis.This ranking is based on the percentage of P pupils who have met Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence required standards across the core skills. schools have not published their stats since they have been able to properly assess students among other factors.The pandemic has seen literacy and numeracy skills deteriorate in a quarter of P classes compared to those who began school before the coronavirus crisis.See how each primary school ranks 👇 https:t.co uewfcJogYwThe data also suggests that \"one-third of Scottish schools saw a fall in reading, writing and counting skills among primary seven pupils last year,\" according to The Times.These are the best performing primary schools in Scotland according to The Times.These are the ten worst-performing primary schools in Scotland as published in The Times  league table. How did the East Lothian schools fare These are all the primary schools in East Lothian as they appeared in The Times  league table. Not all schools in the county have been included in the list as The Times said they had not released their statistics due to the inability to properly assess their students amongst other factors.See the full  league table via The Times website."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-crunch-talks-health-secretary-unacceptable-situation-riverside-medical-practice","story":"Colin Beattie MSP demanded that immediate action be taken after meeting Humza Yousaf MSP to express the “great concerns” over access to appointments, which had carried on for “too long”.The Riverside – the largest practice in East Lothian and one of the biggest in Scotland, with about , patients – has come under continued fire from patients, who have complained of dficulties contacting the practice by phone and booking an appointment.Following the head-to-head with Mr Yousaf last week, Mr Beattie said it was agreed by all parties that the demand for healthcare in Musselburgh had exceeded the capacity the practice, based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, could provide.LAST CHANCE: Subscribe to the Courier free of charge before offer ends on MondayMr Beattie said: “This is a pre-pandemic issue where patients have struggled to access the first basic step in the healthcare system.“I do not believe the severe circumstances Riverside patients encounter accessing healthcare are comparable to any other medical practice in the Lothian region.“Following discussion with the Cabinet Secretary, I am glad he has personally taken this issue on board and wants to seek out a solution.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

the wearer would like extra space, would be available to anyone who wants one.She said: “Soyou or anyone you know is worried about being out and about and would feel safer with a bit more space,

reported as well as  new reported deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital

and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing

That’s not doing a favour for black people. If you change that name you are actually saying a black person is called a black bitch. “This is sometimes the lack of thinking that some people who mean well can carry out, and therefore that sign should remain because it’s referring to a story about a dog.” The campaign to save the name has also been supported by West Lothian Council. A motion supported by SNP, Labour and Conservative councillors said: “For generations, people who were born within the boundary of the Royal Burgh have been proud to be known as Black Bitches given their association with the town.  The original reason given for the name change, that it was racist effectively, now makes this a slur on the reputation of these residents.” A spokesman for Greene King said the company is considering responses to the name change and a final announcement on the proposed name change is expected shortly. However, the row has also turned focus on Greene King’s own history. Its founder, Benjamin Greene, was a pro-slavery plantation owner who opposed the Slavery Abolition Bill and kept enslaved people at his estates in Montserrat and St Kitts. Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive, said: “As part of our commitment to being an anti-racist organisation we want our pub names to be welcoming and inclusive and that means taking action when there is a need to make a positive change for the better.” But Alistair Old, spokesman for the action committee fighting the proposal, said it had caused “deep anger and offence” and even led to racist abuse towards its members.  “Greene King’s actions and their damaging statements have also raised unhealthy isions in the town, and presented a target for racist iniduals to attack some of our members. “We sincerely hope Greene King will finally accept they have been over- zealous in their endeavors to be seen as an anti-racist organisation.  “They only weaken true cases of racism by targeting names which have no association with racist origins.” He added: “It is ironic that a company with a founder and a history steeped in the transatlantic slave trade should point the finger at Linlithgow’s heritage and its famous greyhound and claim it is racist and offensive  “Perhaps they should reflect on their own name instead as it has strong ties with the slave trade.” "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I’ve obviously got my views on those, but that was one thing.“I’ve toured a lot away from England with the red-ball stuff and experienced bowling with the Kookaburra and how to be effective. I think the Aussies showed they were just relentless and they made it challenging for our batters because of the pace they had.“But it is what it is, that’s gone. There’s a lot of cricket to look forward to now.Great night making my debut for @thunderbbl last night, nice to start with a win! pic wEBKVso— Saqib MahmoodDecember , “I think you go through phases in your career and you come into this environment and you’re happy to be here when you first get here. I feel like I’m at the stage now where I don’t just want to be here, I want to come in and I want to make an impact and perform.”Mahmood got a taste of being at the forefront when he was leading wicket-taker and player of the series in three one-day internationals against Pakistan last summer, when a makesht squad had to be assembled.He added: “You really feel part of the team and you contribute all the time, that’s where I want to be in all three formats. You’ve got to earn that, it comes with time. Hopefully when I get my opportunities, I can take them.”Mahmood drew a line under his Ashes disappointment at the Big Bash League, where he made an instant impression for Sydney Thunder, taking four for  on debut and contributing  wickets across six matches.Saqib Mahmood here, pushing for a place in tomorrow’s penultimate T against the West Indies pic WWKcfR— David CharlesworthJanuary , He has discovered the harsher end of the spectrum during the ongoing Twenty series against West Indies, where he conceded  in the final over of the second match which England won by one run, including three successive sixes by tail-ender Akeal Hosein from the last three deliveries.Mahmood insisted he has not been scarred by the incident, reasonably pointing out England had won the game by that stage as long as he did not did not bowl a wide or no-ball, so he felt no need to take any risks.He said: “It has obviously been blown out of all proportion in the end. Obviously the headlines will be by one run and  off the last over. That’s something I’ve got to accept because I made that decision in the last three balls.“The last three balls didn’t upset me out in the middle. If you saw my reaction after the last ball I had a massive smile on my face because I knew what I needed to do whether we win by one run or  runs. It’s still a win and obviously I just took one for the team a little bit.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We’ve done it before and you can look at it two ways: you can say you’re underdone or you can say you’re really fresh and raring to go.“I think we’re in that bracket.

Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden.

The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph.

The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Now he seems secure again.Days ago Boris Johnson seemed finished as prime minister. It was being reported last night that the only people who can sack him, Tory MPs, were now beginning to rally behind his leadership.Anda week is a long time, a year is an eternity.Arlene Foster’s demise was sudden. Edwin Poots’s rise to be her DUP successor was swt and his fall from that post almost as fast.Then only weeks ago there seemed to be a Westminster solution to the DUP’s challenge in getting its third leader in quick succession, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, into Stormont without having immediately to give up his Lagan Valley constituency and force a risky by-election there.But then that proposal — a temporary exemption to the double jobbing ban — was pulled from under him and there was fresh focus on how the DUP would manage the ious obstacles to finding a seat for Sir Jeffrey in the constituency where he is long established, but so are Mr Poots and Paul Givan.What then does last night’s political twist within the DUP mean By going for the South Down MLA nomination, Mr Poots was leaving the way clear for Mr Givan and Sir Jeffrey to be DUP MLAs for Lagan Valley .What did Jim Wells make of the Poots bid to move to the constituency in which Mr Wells is long established as the main DUP personality  Perhaps it was a disappointment, after Mr Wells had been such a gushing supporter of Edwin Poots as DUP leader.Or perhaps Mr Wells already knew that he was not going to be on the DUP shortlist, so it was not too much of a problem.Mr Poots will now have to cast around for another constituency.His leadership manoeuvre last May clearly annoyed much of the DUP establishment, who treated his victory with an overt coolness, even contempt, that the party rarely displayed in public towards senior figures, whatever private misgivings there might have been about any of them.Do some such figures now want to bury Mr Poots’s career entirely or were they only motivated by the view that Diane Forsythe was a better standard bearer in South Down One thing that strikes me about Mr Poots is an admirable ability to weather setbacks and even humiliations like his astonishingly brief tenure as DUP leader, and to soldier on without seeming bitter, so he might well cheerfully continue his search for a seat.The ious developments in unionism in recent weeks do not tell us much about ideological direction, except that the UUP and DUP are both chasing the liberal vote.In the case of Doug Beattie, it is a more explicit pitch to the values of the Alliance Party.In the case of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, it is a move to capture the centre of unionism.But while the DUP is not moving in what anyone would call a strongly liberal direction, and while it still wants to be a broad church, it seems to have calculated that very traditional or fundamentalist Christian voters are sufficiently small in number that it can afford to lose many of them.It cannot afford to lose the growing numbers of people who are moderate on social questions such as abortion policy or same-sex relations. People, in other words, who are by no means radical on such matters but who are not traditionalists on them either.But all these political labels at times seem confused or contradictory.Doug Beattie is a ‘liberal’ who has, as a result of his tweets, potentially fallen foul of voters who have a ‘woke’ outlook on the world. He also took quite a robust unionist line on matters such as legacy and the Irish language.Edwin Poots is a ‘conservative’ who was in fact notably pragmatic on issues such as Gaelic and evenon the Irish Sea border.While it would not be quite right to characterise his politics as ‘liberal’ it was in no way hardline.Where will this all end Over the longer term unionism seems destined to become a centrist-leaning conservative movement. It will always been seen as somewhat on the right of the political spectrum because its primary position is preservation of the status quo. At the moment things seem bad for unionism, but that might not be so for long.There are still signs that very large numbers of voters, probably a comfortable majority, are themselves happy with the status quo.And radical liberal or leftist movements, in both the UK and the United States, have helped to bolster both the Conservative Party in England and the Republican Party in the US. In Northern Ireland, Alliance has been riding high for some years now, and certain polls suggest it could go higher still. But it might yet be damaged by its embracing of what some voters still consider to be ultra liberal values, or its europhilia A thing to watch is support for the TUV. Jim Allister’s standing in opinion polls fluctuates signicantly. He is trying to capture traditionalists, as is obvious from the party name, but also that large number of people who are very strong on the Union but not religious.l Ben Lowryis News Letter editor"},{"url":null,"title":"i hope that jim wells stands for election to stormont as an independent or with another party ","story":"Moment’s silence for crash victim Jon O’Hara at Ulster Rugby game against Scarlets   Jim Wells speaks of ‘confused situation’ as Edwin Poots to stand for election in South DownNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionI hope that Jim Wells stands for election to Stormont as an independent or with another partyA letter from Lee Maginnis:By LettersSaturday, th January , : amUpdated Saturday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Jim Wells pictured in May  after his re-election to the assembly for South DownI am dismayed at the treatment of Jim Wells by the DUP.

He tells Laura Harding about the emotional experienceBy The NewsroomFriday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Kenneth Branagh has shown real flair in his direction of the autobiographical film, BelfastWhen Sir Kenneth Branagh was a little boy growing up in Northern Ireland, a mob of Protestants rioted down his street, smashing windows, brandishing pieces of wrought iron and threatening the Catholics who were living peacefully there.His family, who were Protestants themselves, were unharmed, but the moment was a defining one for the actor and director, who recreates the harrowing moment in the opening of his new semi-autobiographical film, Belfast.The family drama follows a little boy called Buddy, played by newcomer Jude Hill, whose family, including parents played by The Tourist’s Jamie Dornan and Outlander star Caitriona Balfe, are caught up in the Troubles at the end of the s, sparking his parents’ decision to leave their home behind.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

And it has had me quite a bit closer to tears on a day-to-day basis than I might otherwise be. But part of the process was understanding that tears can be helpful.”It was only during the editing process that Sir Kenneth, whose previous directing projects include Thor, Cinderella and Murder On The Orient Express – as well as a string of Shakespeare adaptations, thought about how the film might be received by others who had lived through this period in history.“The film sort of revealed that that’s what it was about, and that’s what it was for. The weight of sadness across the ious incidents, as well as the tenderness and the hard earned joy, just somehow allowed you to recognise that it was tough for everyone and it was a shared tragedy and the wound is still one that is shared by many people.  stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Jude Hillstars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast. PIC: PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.“It’s important to remember stories like this, lest we forget, because the peace which has to be won every day is hard earned and hard won, and I think, many, many, many people do not want to go back to those days.”While the film was deeply personal for its creator, it was also personal for its stars, many of whom grew up in the midst of the Troubles or felt their painful ripple effects.“I was born  years into a -year conflict,” says -year-old Dornan, who grew up in Belfast, “and I’ve seen the effect that it’s had on the place and the people, both during the conflict and the post-conflict society there. It couldn’t be more personal really, to be able to tell the story.“I left at , Caitriona left at , not to avoid the beginning of a war, but we all did for dferent reasons, and I understand what that means. And I’ve also spent  years going around the world, telling people I’m from Belfast and seeing all kinds of reactions to just that.“And I think this film can help to settle some of the ideas that people have about that place and the people in my place, because we get to see it through the eyes of a normal family and that’s really vital.”Balfe, , who was born in Dublin and grew up right on the border, added: “When I read the script one of the things that impacted upon me was just the compassion and the empathy Ken had for this ordinary working class family who had not asked for this. “We’ve seen many great films about the Troubles, but there’s been an absence of films just about the everyday family, who sort of got caught up among it.”From North Belfast to RADA and playing the great DaneSir Kenneth Charles Branagh was born on December , and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where he has served as president since . He has been nominated for five Academy Awards, as well as having won three BAFTAs, two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Ken was knighted on November ,  and was made a Freeman of Belfast in January . In , he was listed at number  on Thelist of Ireland’s greatest film actors.Branagh has both directed and starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare’s plays, including Othello , and most notably Hamletwherein he played the tormented Dane and delivered the lapidary ‘To be or not to be’ speech with perhaps more fervour than any actor before or since. He was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Director for Henry V and for Best Adapted Screenplay for Hamlet.He has starred in innumerable television series and films including Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein , Wallanderand Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .‘Overnight our street was turned into a war zone’ recalls Branagh of By Joanne SavageKenneth Branagh’s older brother Bill told Ann Ferran of The Sunday Times in : “Ken was a regular little boy growing up in Belfast, who played football in the street. When my father went away he’d bring us back a little matchbox car. I used to keep mine pristine clean, but Ken used to take the tyres off his.”In the same illuminating article, Ken said of the place where he grew up: “The area was predominantly Protestant, but there was a smattering of Catholics. Everybody got on. There was a real sense of community. “We had a large extended family. “Le in Belfast was very grounded and family-orientated, and Bill and I were thrown together - we shared a bed. I remember being in bed next to him, and whichever book he wasn’t reading for school I’d pick up. So I was introduced to Shakespeare through him. “The cardinal sin back in Belfast was to show off or make a fuss. ‘Don’t have any ideas above your station.’ That was my parents’ philosophy. “To them, money was only important for putting a roof over your head it wasn’t an end in itself. And a person’s religion made no dference to my parents, though not everyone in Belfast shared that view. “My Dad was a Protestant, but he was never in the Orange Order.”Sir Ken continued: “My mother had just got pregnant with my sister when things became quite intense in Belfast. One night Bill came running up our street saying: “Get in the house!” We heard a terrible buzzing noise. “I saw a sort of cloud at the bottom of the street, which turned out to be a huge bomb. “Bill pushed Mum and me under a table in the back room. We didn’t know it then, but it was the mob outside, who were picking up the iron gratings from the drains at the side of the roads and throwing them through the windows of the Catholic houses. “Hours later, there were barricades at the top and bottom of the street, while the men ided themselves into vigilante groups. “Our street had turned into a war zone overnight.“In the wake of that, my parents felt uneasy about Belfast. My father, who was a joiner, had been offered a job in England, at a management level, and they decided to take the opportunity.” Branagh added: “The move to England felt at times like some kind of betrayal. The transformation from that very grounded Belfast le, with its comfortable and simple expectations, had a profound effect on me. “I feel that only now do I have a strong sense of who I am in the way that I did in Belfast. “Today I’m less conflicted and guilt-ridden. And, believe me, Jews and Catholics don’t have a monopoly on guilt. “The Protestant work ethic was branded on my forehead:you are fit and talented it is your duty to use it.” Heartfelt tribute to a city with spirit defiantly undimmedFILM REVIEW: BELFASTBy Joanne SavageThis superbly directed film, shot in elegant monochrome, is a nostalgic and fiercely affectionate paean to a city that shaped its director in his heart and soul. Buddy, played by the adorable and wide-eyed Jude Hill, is a double for the young Ken, who, while crushing on the smartest girl in his class, and simply wanting to enjoy trips to the cinema to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and play in the street with a fake sword and a bin lid, struggles to understand why violence breaks out so suddenly and inexplicably, as he looks up with wonder at his Pa, played masterfully and with real sensitivity by Jamie Dornan, who refuses to be drawn into the persecution of his Catholic neighbours, and emerges as the moral centre of the piece, alongside Caitriona Balfe’s stoical and beautul Ma.Ciaran Hinds and Judi Dench are profoundly affecting as Buddy’s grandparents, full of earthy, Ulsterish wit and tenderness, even as the community outside their humble terraced abode becomes mired in internecine stre.The warmth and humour shared among the family at epicentre of the film stands in stark contrast to the street vigilantes who will no longer tolerate the Catholics among them.There is a wonderful moment where Popis helping Buddy with his maths homework. Pop, ailing in health, tells him to make his answers blurry, to keep the teacher guessing, he might get marked up or down, but does he want to impress his would-be classroom sweetheart or not  Still, Buddy wants to know the right answer. “If there were a right answer son, and we all knew it, would they be doing what they’re doing out there ” muses Pop. Some may find Branagh’s liberally applied doses of sugar to a narrative about the birth of Belfastian tragedy something of a sentimental gloss over the true horrors of , but actually what the much vaunted director achieves here is heroic and defiant: as those who chose violence raged, le still found a way, love triumphed over hatred in most homes and nothing could blot out the fundamental spirit of the right-thinking members of both communities. We’ve all seen gritty films about the Troubles that besieged Belfast, but what Branagh is really saying is that through the eyes of a young boy living with a loving family who protected him, it was still shot through with magic, wonder and people who did not care about who was Catholic or Protestant or neither.Certainly Dornan’s Pa tells Buddy that it doesn’t matterthe girl he loves is a “Catholic or a Hindu or a vegetarian Antichrist” because Everlasting Loveis a flame unextinguished, indeed, as Morrissey might say, a light that never goes out.RATING:  Belfast is in cinemas now."},{"url":null,"title":"poots and wells miss out as dup confirms diane forsythe for south down ","story":"Tim McGarry: Sorry Sir Kenny, but no-one was called Buddy in Belfast in    Policing Board don’t see intelligence on IRA ‘due to Sinn Fein plea’ says former top PSNI officerNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsPoots and Wells miss out as DUP confirms Diane Forsythe for South DownThe DUP has selected former Westminster candidate Diane Forsythe for the South Down constituency.By Mark RaineyFriday, th January , : pmUpdated Friday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Diane Forsythe.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention.

I wish to reiterate to learners, schools and colleges that exams and assessments this year will go ahead, unless the public health situation makes it impossible for them to physically run – which we do not envisage.“The intention to adjust grade boundaries to reflect disruption has already been set out. Adaptations to exam content have been put in place as well as prior notication of areas of examination.“I encourage all learners in exam years to talk to their schools and colleges about what additional support and flexibility might be available this year, to help them progress with confidence.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Obviously the headlines will be by one run and  off the last over. That’s something I’ve got to accept because I made that decision in the last three balls.“The last three balls didn’t upset me out in the middle.

Following a trip to Belfast from where we were staying in Omagh, we made a stop at Sprucefield, where my husband offered to dispose of the litter – which included the plastic bag, without realising its contents.”Pictured with the jewellery are Danny McErlain, Operations Manager at RiverRidge and Vytautus Skurdauskis.It wasn’t until Kathleen went looking for her jewellery the following morning that she realised it wasn’t in the car. After a frantic search, the couple realised that the jewellery had been thrown out during their stop at Sprucefield.Kathleen continued: “When we realised what had happened, we drove back to Sprucefield to seethere was any chance of retrieving the jewellery but as expected, the bins had been emptied. At this stage, I had lost all hope of ever being reunited with my jewellery collection again.” Staff at Sprucefield helped Kathleen get in touch with the team at RiverRidge.RiverRidge collect waste from all parts of Northern Ireland. In most instances, all waste is processed on the day of collection at one of the company’s three Materials Recovery Facilities, so it is very rare to find anything that someone mistakenly throws away.Senior Commercial Manager at RiverRidge, Pamela Jordan explained: “When I received Kathleen’s email on Monday morning, I knew how distressing this must have been for her. However, given the nature of our business and the large amount of waste we collect, we were unsure about what the outcome would be.“We always try to accommodate as best we can though, and after contacting our Operations Manager at the Mallusk facility, Danny McErlain, the team got to work – literally on their hands and knees seeingany of the jewellery could be recovered.”At this point, Kathleen and Eric had arrived at the ferry port, and were waiting to board the boat for theirto Scotland, resigned to the fact that the jewellery was gone. She said: “I had accepted that the jewellery was lost, and I was devastated. That was until, like ine intervention, I received a call from Pamela telling me that the plastic bag containing my jewellery had been found. I couldn’t believe it, I was elated.“I am so grateful to everyone who helped out along the way – from the team at Sprucefield, to Pamela, and all the team at RiverRidge who went above and beyond to retrieve the jewellery. Everyone was so incredible.“We hear so many stories about unhelpful people and poor customer service, but rarely about the good. On this occasion, nobody could have been more helpful, comforting and reassuring. My sincere thanks to everyone who was involved.”----Read More Read MoreTranslink phasingof timetables as restrictions easeNorthern IrelandFe  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularBallymena pupil wins car with a ‘touch’ of luck...NewsMasked burglars smash into Glengormley home...NewsStorm Malik: fallen trees across NI and cancelled ferry cros...NewsCocaine found on top of dresser in bedroom...News‘Love Grace’ handbag appeal in Coleraine...NewsMost PopularDine in on Valentine’s Day with Morrisons £ meal deal ...RecommendedSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
