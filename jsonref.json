Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027    Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot. Pictured: Mel B with Angel (left), Madison (center) and Phoenix, 19, (right) on Mother\u0027s Day           Updegraff shared texts messages he received from Mel B\u0027s best friend Charlotte, who tried to stage an intervention with the singer, which lists her numerous partners          The screenshots Updegraff provided also reveal an enormous tower of tequila boxes stockpiled in Mel B\u0027s homeOn another occasion one of the star\u0027s Instagram posts got the attention of Angel.Mel posed naked with hairdresser and BFF Gary Madatyan, who was also naked, in a swimming pool and posted the provocative photos on her social media feed.Rusty, 60, recalls the shocking moment Mel\u0027s daughter spotted the post.\u0027We were in Palm Springs and Mel had been drinking. I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children          Last month when Mel revealed she was heading for rehab for PTSD, she admitted she was struggling to deal with her emotions - which lead her to seek solace in booze and sex.

Our thoughts and continued support are with those who have been injured and affected.\u0027           Massachusetts Gov Charlie Baker and Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera were both critical of Columbia Gas\u0027 response to the emergencyIt said its focus was on \u0027providing as much support as possible\u0027 but it offered no apology nor did it take any responsibility for the explosions. The company did not respond to DailyMail.com\u0027s inquiries about the disaster on Friday morning.            Another home in Lawrence, is shown on Friday, the day after the sequence of explosions. Officials are yet to confirm it but they believe the cause was an over-pressurized gas main           The top floor windows of a property in Lawrence were all blown out as a result of the explosions. The gas company whose pipes were the ones which blew were due to replace them over the next few weeks          Part of a home which was affected in Lawrence is shown on Friday. Residents were out walking the streets despite warnings about staying away from the areaSenator Ed Markey tweeted on Friday: \u0027Shortly before 5pm yesterday, gas explosions ripped across Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover, setting dozens of homes ablaze, injuring more than 20, and killing one.           Senator Ed Markey labeled the gas company\u0027s response to the disaster \u0027totally unacceptable\u0027 on Friday. Columbia Gas has not replied to DailyMail.com\u0027s inquiries \u0027Columbia Gas didn\u0027t post its first update until after 9pm, 4+ hours after the disaster. Totally unacceptable.\u0027  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed, 12 people were injured and 18-year-old Leonel Rondon was killed.According to the state fire marshal, which is still investigating the cause of the accident, it is likely that an over pressurized gas main is what caused it.It is not known if Columbia Gas was planning to replace it as part of its improvement works.In its announcement of the project on Thursday, the company said: \u0027As with many other types of infrastructure, like roads, dams, and bridges, deterioration occurs over time and repairs or replacement are eventually needed.\u0027The old gas pipes installed in your neighborhood generations ago served us well, but they are now ready to be retired.\u0027If we do nothing, the cost to maintain and repair these older pipes will be higher than the cost to replace them.           A home in North Andover, another town which saw explosions, is pictured on Friday, the day after the explosions           A house in Lawrence was taped off by police on Friday. Many residents were forced to leave as a safety precaution regardless of whether their home had been blown up \u0027That is why we are taking proactive steps today, reducing costs to our customers.\u0027 For the people driven out of their homes by the fires, it will be a long time before they can return to normal life, let alone their properties. On Friday, schools in the area remain closed. The explosions caused 18,000 people across the city to lose power.  Rondon was killed by flying debris which hit the car he was traveling in with two friends. He was out celebrating getting his driver\u0027s license at the time. Gov. Charlie Baker said on Thursday night that state and local authorities are investigating but that it could take days or weeks before they turn up answers.          The Massachusetts State Police released an image on Thursday of a map showing where the fires are.

It’s so sad, because he’s missing out on so much.’Part of the problem is, I believe, that even in the 21st century the image of retirement remains firmly stuck in the past. It feels out of sync in a world that places such a high premium on being purposeful and busy — and where being stressed out is not only the norm, but a marker of success.‘We have become so obsessed over the past few decades with working hard and the idea of being a “go-getter” that retirement — because it’s the antithesis of that — is seen as giving up,’ says Ian Stuart-Hamilton, professor of developmental psychology at the University of South Wales.‘There are more than enough role models now of people who are ploughing on long past retirement age, like the U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett, who’s 88.‘The danger is that once you get trapped into that mindset, retirement then seems like a kind of failure.’So what can we do to change that mindset? Today and next week I will explore how we can, with careful planning and honesty about our long-term goals, turn the potential negatives of retirement into positives.I will look at the thorny issues that trouble those about to retire: how and when to take that all-important step reinventing ourselves for the next phase keeping physically and mentally alert and, yes, rekindling our marriages, too.WINDING DOWN OR A LEAP IN THE DARK?TIME was when the decision about how and when to stop work was easy. The retirement age was fixed at 65 for men and 60 for women, and those milestones remained comfortably in the back of your mind for the whole of your working life.But with a change in the law in 2011 abolishing the default retirement age, the certainties have been swept away.In theory, we can all carry on till we drop. Indeed, the numbers choosing to work on after 65 have doubled to a record 1.19 million over the past ten years.So of all the numerous retirement options that now confront us, which one is best?Phased in: reducing your hours gradually by working part- time before leaving? Cliff-edge: stopping work overnight? Portfolio: a mixture of part-time, consultancy, self-employment andor voluntary work?The list goes on. Should I defer my pension? Should I take it as a lump sum, or as an annuity, or drawdown?Retirement has gone from being a single, easy-to-grasp concept to a mind-boggling mixed bag of possibilities.          So why is it that so many people find retirement unbelievably tough?On the face of it, stopping work overnight sounds like a seriously bad idea. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s true that many retirements get off to a bad start when the change is too sudden. Yet the surprising truth is that for others, it works very well.‘You remember that wonderful feeling when you were a child and the summer holidays seemed to stretch in front of you endlessly?’ says Lily, who took early retirement from the Department for Work and Pensions in Sheffield. ‘That’s how I felt the day after I left work.‘It was as though I’d been given a gift. To begin with it felt like annual leave. But after a few weeks came the realisation that I didn’t have to go back. It was wonderful.’The key to making cliff-edge retirement work is preparation, says Chris Phillipson, professor of sociology and social gerontology at Manchester University.‘The assumption that cliff-edge is bad is just that — an assumption,’ he says. ‘It may not be bad if you’re supported, or it may well be very bad if there is no support.’For others, the idea of weaning yourself off work gradually over a period of months or years is more appealing. There are two ways to do this: either by negotiating phased retirement with your employer, or by leaving your full‑time job and finding new part-time work or self-employment.‘On the whole, it’s been very good,’ says Irene, an administrative assistant who has reduced her days in preparation for her retirement. ‘If I had retired suddenly, it wouldn’t have given me a chance to see what I’m going to do with my time.\u0027I hope he burns in hell!\u0027: Jessica Chambers\u0027 mom visits...Hiic Taco Bell employee is FIRED after she refused to...Share this article‘It’s taken me a while to find new clubs and classes I really like and activities I want to do. Now I’m in the swing of it, I’m really looking forward to retiring.‘Also, if I’d gone for cliff-edge retirement, the money would have been cut off straight away. As it is, I’ve gradually got used to not spending so much.’But phased retirement is not without its flaws. For some people, it turns out to be an unsatisfactory limbo where they end up with a foot in both camps, and not enough time or energy to give their full attention to either.‘It can be difficult because your position in the workplace is immediately changed,’ says Professor Phillipson. ‘You’re half in and half out.‘Some people are comfortable with the changed relationship they have with colleagues, but some aren’t. If that’s the case, they are dragging out a change they might be best doing straight away.’What’s increasingly popular is a mixture of part-time work, paid or unpaid consultancy and volunteering — which hopefully leaves time to have fun, too.With this option there’s a flexibility that allows people to shift the balance between their different activities as their priorities change. Reducing your workload in your main career is a good way of moving into a mixed portfolio.          Look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up childrenSpecific ideas are more useful than vague ambitions. Where will you spend most of your time? What will you be doing? With which friends do you want to socialise? How will weekends differ from weekdays?If you plan to volunteer, work part-time or set up your own business, find out what skills or qualifications you might need.Finally, look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up children. Now is the time to revive them.MANAGE THE TRANSITIONTHE latest research suggests that the best way to cope with retirement is to treat it not as the end of the road, but as a major life transition, on a par with leaving home or facing up to an empty nest.And the good news is that by this stage in their lives, people have what it takes to cope successfully, according to psychology lecturer Dr Oliver Robinson.‘We can learn a lot from previous transitions,’ he says. ‘Many of the same issues come up in major life crises, such as identity, meaning, purpose. If you navigate through a crisis successfully and grow out of it, it should mean you’re well prepared for the next one.’Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, agrees. ‘Retirement can be a dirty word, because people see it as the end a phase where you do nothing,’ she says. ‘If you change jobs, you go from Job A to Job B. But retirement has no B attached. The antidote is to see retirement as a change, rather than a movement towards nothing.’This new and illuminating approach focuses on how the psychological qualities we have developed during previous transitions and throughout our working lives — attributes such as resilience, adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a ‘can-do’ attitude — can stand us in good stead for the challenges of retirement.John, who took two extended breaks from work to go travelling, first in his 30s and then in his 50s, when he went to Barcelona for a few months to learn Spanish and ended up staying away for seven years, is a case in point.‘I think both experiences helped me when it came to preparing for retirement,’ he says. ‘You realise that you have to make things happen. You can’t be passive.’He is so right. It’s true that the happiest retired people are often the ones who are most proactive about looking for interesting stuff to do. If there’s no birdwatching or film club in their area, they don’t hang around they set one up.When one friend of mine retired to the countryside, she really missed her book group. So she bravely went up to anyone she liked the look of and asked if they would like to join hers.If you’re lucky enough to come across someone like this, see them as the true asset they are.IT’S TIME TO CREATE A NEW YOURETIRING involves one of the biggest shifts of identity we ever go through — as momentous as becoming a parent or leaving home. After years of being seen, and of seeing yourself, as a shopkeeper or a nurse or an engineer, you suddenly become an ex-whatever it was. It’s common to feel, as Nadia does, ‘that you’re 60 and you’re just not in the world any more. You don’t matter.’For her, the loss of status she feels is acute.‘I don’t like being invisible when I walk into a room,’ says Nadia. ‘At work you have a formal place to assert yourself. You get paid.          Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you‘Then all that structure is shipped away and you’re left just sort of flapping around, saying: “I used to be a . . .”‘Everything you’ve built up throughout your career disappears, and suddenly you’re just another old lady looking to do a bit of volunteering.’For women in particular, work bestows an independent identity quite separate from home and family life. When that disappears — and it often coincides with losing the hands-on parenting role — it can leave people feeling doubly discombobulated.It may be that you don’t even want to think about a new identity before you retire. But if you are aware that work dominates your life (or your partner’s) to the exclusion of other interests, it’s worth starting to develop at least one new activity beforehand.Supportive networks that run parallel to work and that will continue beyond it can be a huge help.People will start to see you not just as a brilliant brain surgeon, but as a wicked darts player or a fine guitarist.Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you.It’s also important to reinforce this new identity with other people. Rather than apologetically saying: ‘I used to be a . . .’ when asked what you do, it feels much more positive to say: ‘I’m studying astronomy,’ or ‘I’m planning to start a rag-rugging business.’Soon, other people in your immediate circle and beyond will get used to seeing you in a new light, and that, in turn, reinforces your own new view of yourself.Liz, who retired two years ago, got round the problem by telling people she was taking ‘a pause’, rather than that she had finished work. ‘If you tell people you’re retired, their eyes glaze over a bit — especially younger people,’ she says. ‘I didn’t enjoy the glazing.‘However, when I started exploring a new part of myself and tried out different things I really enjoyed, I became comfortable with the idea of a different identity. Now I’m happy to say I’m retired.’It’s a process that happens organically, but sometimes it needs a bit of a push.As your work persona gradually recedes, it leaves space for a different side of life to take centre stage, and you can spend more time on activities that resonate with your core values.

They may yet succeed. But I am beginning to doubt it.Indeed, I believe that Mrs May could be on the verge of securing the greatest triumph of her political career.Although cynics predict that her visit to Salzburg on Wednesday will end in tears, I have spoken to well-informed sources close to the British and European sides of the Brexit negotiating teams and detect signs of a breakthrough. There\u0027s a mood of optimism — of friendship even.Revealed: The election speech Theresa May wanted to deliver...Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleThere\u0027s a quiet, but growing, belief that the British Prime Minister is close to striking a remarkable deal. Of course, that won\u0027t happen in Salzburg. There could well be a confected row between the 27 other EU leaders and Mrs May. That would be designed to give the impression that Brussels won\u0027t be a pushover on Brexit.However, no one can deny that the rudiments for a deal exist. And it\u0027s one that would enable Britain to leave the EU on reasonable terms.Let me explain how this has been achieved. Until recent weeks, our negotiators have been struggling against a Brussels bureaucracy fronted by intransigent chief negotiator Michel Barnier, supported by the clapped-out Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.          Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May welcomes Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to 10 Downing Street in London in June 25, 2018Confronting them has been like negotiating with a wall of flint.No wonder talks repeatedly foundered.It didn\u0027t help that Barnier\u0027s relationship with David Davis, before he stood down as Brexit Secretary, was toxic.For her part, Mrs May should be able to bypass the wretched Barnier and Juncker. She will deal directly with French leader Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Both of them are realists. Not only are they aware that it\u0027s in their countries\u0027 best interests not to treat Britain badly, but that Mrs May deserves decent terms for us departing the EU.Merkel has been told forcefully by Germany\u0027s manufacturers that it is vital for them not to face unnecessary hurdles selling products to their biggest market — Britain. If that means, for example, importing British-made Range Rovers and Nissans freely in exchange for exporting their own BMWs and Mercedes, so be it.Of course Mrs May will come under intense pressure to water down her so-called Chequers proposals. EU negotiators will endeavour to force Britain to keep access to European markets on condition that we sign up to European single market rules and regulations. Britain will also be told to keep paying tens of billions of pounds into EU coffers.But as far as Mrs May is concerned, some of these concessions would be worth it rather than risk Britain exiting with no deal.A successful outcome would be an unmitigated triumph for our embattled Prime Minister.It would also prove wrong all those who have likened her Chequers strategy to a dodo.Barnier, Juncker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair, Vince Cable and her detractors in the media would all have to eat humble pie.          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, (middle right) embraces British Prime Minister Theresa May (middle left) after a meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels Oct 16, 2017Some, such as the most dyspeptic hard-line Tory Brexiteers, would, of course, refuse. They would unsheath daggers at next month\u0027s Conservative Party conference and hurl shouts of \u0027betrayal\u0027.But the truth is that such a Brexit deal with the EU would honour Mrs May\u0027s promise to the British people that Brexit would mean a free trade area for goods no more free movement of people across our border leaving the Common Agricultural Policy taking back control of UK waters by quitting the Common Fisheries Policy supremacy for UK courts and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice.This weekend, the Tory Brexit rebels are gravely weakened. The first sign of this emerged when their European Research Group (ERG) faction failed to put forward cogent proposals for how Britain would survive outside the EU if Mrs May\u0027s Chequers deal collapsed. Also, all the foment about a leadership challenge to Mrs May proved to be nothing but a mirage.Furthermore, awkward questions are being asked about the funding of the ERG, with a possible investigation by parliamentary watchdogs into a secret bank account used to pay for wining and dining supporters.While these high-stakes politics are being played out, it is vital to remember that the referendum ballot paper in June 2016 asked voters to make a simple choice: whether they wanted to remain in, or leave, the European Union.There were no stated terms on which Britain might leave.Considering the way politics has descended into the gutter during the 27 months since then, Theresa May has climbed bravely to near the pinnacle of the mountain.How apposite that, next week, it will be beside the majestic Alps, in Salzburg, that she might start to believe that an honourable Brexit is finally within reach.  Cook\u0027s first-class retirement           Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket after playing for more than a decade at the top of his professionEvery leading politician should learn from the dignified way that Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket.After playing for more than a decade at the top of his profession, he will continue to turn out for his Essex county team for another three years.What a contrast with both Tony Blair and David Cameron, who abruptly abandoned the House of Commons after standing down as prime minister.This point was well made by Labour MP Chris Bryant, who said that the two men should have remained in front-line politics to offer the benefit of their years of experience.In previous ages, ex-prime ministers often stayed on as MPs. A notable example was first-class cricketer Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served as foreign secretary in the Heath government for four years after he lost the 1964 General Election as PM.Intriguingly it was Sir Alec who once famously said, years before Britain joined what was then the Common Market, that the embryonic union of European countries was \u0027a dead duck that could not quack\u0027!  Despite their shrill accusations about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, the Tories have a serious anti-Semitism problem of their own.This was disgracefully demonstrated by Conservative MEPs\u0027 support for the hard-Right Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, who has waged a long, vicious vendetta against the Jewish philanthropist George Soros, accusing him of plotting to take control of the country.Orban has made inflammatory comments about Muslims and hailed a Hungarian leader who collaborated with the Nazis during the Holocaust as \u0027an outstanding statesman\u0027.This week, Conservative MEPs opposed a motion in the European Parliament which condemned Orban for attacking minorities and suppressing free speech and press freedom. They were the only governing party in Western Europe to do so.Although Theresa May\u0027s spokesman dissociated her from her colleagues\u0027 vote, I cannot believe that Tory MEPs would have acted in this way without covert approval from No 10.If this is the case, it is a most misguided policy. For at a time when Brexit talks are in the balance, Mrs May needs every morsel of support from fellow European leaders, and must not offend them by linking Britain with the odious Orban. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/14/19DD622C00000514-0-image-m-19_1536930123649.jpg","title":"British intelligence chiefs thought former Labour leader Michael Foot paid Soviet informant","story":"    Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg GordievskyMI6 believed claims made by a Soviet defector that former Labour leader Michael Foot was a paid KGB contact, according to a new book.Intelligence chiefs were reportedly briefed on the politician’s KGB history in 1982 and were prepared to pass on the information to the Queen had he become prime minister after the following year’s general election.Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg Gordievsky, were first published in the Sunday Times 23 years ago. At the time he dismissed the claims as a ‘big lie’ and successfully sued the paper for libel.But documents, published in The Spy and the Traitor, show that MI6 thought the evidence presented by Mr Gordievsky was strong enough to pass on to the Queen.In a 1982 debriefing, the former agent allegedly said the KGB had paid Mr Foot the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money, according to the new book.Even though he was supposedly paid by the Soviets, Mr Gordievsky said that the politician was not a ‘spy or conscious agent’.Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleInstead he was allegedly a contact who was paid for ‘disinformation purposes’, meaning he might have been fed false information.Mr Foot lost the 1983 election to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party, helped in large part by Britain’s victory in the Falklands War.Author Ben Macintyre wrote: ‘Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election.

The file claims Mr Foot was first contacted by Soviet intelligence while working at the left-wing magazine Tribune in the 1940s.Mr Gordievsky also made claims about how the Soviet secret services had infiltrated other factions of the Labour Party, which had become increasingly left-wing in the early 1980s.The party’s 1983 election manifesto, which outlined several socialist policies, was later dubbed ‘the longest suicide note in history’ by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Mr Foot resigned following the election defeat and three years as Labour leader. He died in 2010 aged 96.Trade union leader Jack Jones was also listed as an ‘agent’ by Mr Gordievsky. The spy claimed he met Mr Jones for lunch, but found him ‘absolutely useless’ as a contact.Mr Gordievsky became a double-agent for MI6 in the 1970s, later rising to be head of the KGB’s London station in the early 1980s. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/12/4EBC9D5E00000578-0-image-a-14_1533121538202.jpg","title":"New eSports degree university students play computer games coursework","story":"    Students at the University of Chichester will pay total fees of £27,750 before living costs  be required to play FIFA, Counter- Strike, League of Legends and Project Cars as part of the degree.

It\u0027s about chucking Chequers.\u0027Mr Johnson faced a Tory backlash over his claim that Mrs May\u0027s Brexit strategy had put the UK in a \u0027suicide vest\u0027 and handed the detonator to Brussels.Lord Heseltine said the slew of recent negative headlines that have dogged Mr Johnson have not done him irreparable harm.The former deputy prime minister, who has been an outspoken critic of Mr Johnson, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s The Week In Westminster: \u0027Has he done himself any irreparable harm? Well I don\u0027t think he has.\u0027What you have to say to yourself is who the Tory Party membership of the House of Commons is going to choose to send to the activists of the Conservative Party in any leadership campaign.\u0027Whilst there is strong opposition to Boris, I find it difficult to think of two names that they will send that don\u0027t include him.\u0027And, if he gets before the activists, my guess is that he will get the nomination.\u0027All that is one thing. But if you then ask a second question. Does that unify the party? Does that solve Brexit? Does it get Britain back into the centre ground.\u0027Those are the key questions about achieving power and my doubts and reservations are very substantial.\u0027  Female politicians should stop dressing so casually in Parliament, senior Labour MP saysChancellor Philip Hammond angers Theresa May with his idea to delay Brexit to fully prepare for No Deal"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/21/502EB17000000578-0-image-m-19_1536958177276.jpg","title":"Former PM Tony Blair accused lifting Michael Sheens lines Oscar winning film Queen","story":"Helen Mirren starring as Queen Elizabeth II in  \u0027The Queen\u0027 written by Peter MorganKate\u0027s mission to rescue kids at risk: Duchess of Cambridge...Share this articleThe Bafta-winning screenwriter was a guest on a US radio show and told the host: \u0027There came a moment after the film that I wrote, The Queen, had come out where Tony Blair was asked about his audience with the Queen. \u0027And in his book, his autobiography, which, of course, came out many years after we made The Queen, Tony Blair, when referring back to that critical period in the aftermath of Diana\u0027s death, used a number of expressions and quotations that seemed to be very familiar because they sounded like my dialogue.\u0027The 2006 movie focuses on that period in the aftermath of Princess Diana\u0027s death and the resulting media maelstrom and its knock-on effect on Blair\u0027s relationship with the Queen.           Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen as Queen Elizabeth II in \u0027The Queen\u0027 written by Peter MorganMorgan continued: \u0027I remember thinking, \u0027Well, hang on a minute.

But not any more.Now, one of the country’s top psychologists and behavioural geneticists, Professor Robert Plomin, of King’s College London, offers an emphatic conclusion.It is drawn from 45 years of research and hundreds of studies. He says the single most important factor in each and every one of us — the very essence of our iniduality — is our genetic make-up, our DNA.The basic building blocks of life that we inherit from our parents are what determine who we are — not how much they loved us, read us books or which school they sent us to.DNA accounts for at least half the variance in people’s psychological traits, much more than any other single factor. Put simply, ‘nature’ trumps ‘nurture’ every time, and not just marginally, but by a long, long chalk.Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits — from how tall we are to how much we weigh — but also to our intelligence and our psychology, from a tendency to depression to having resilience and grit.          Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits but also to our psychologyPlomin’s revolutionary conclusion — outlined in a challenging and thought-provoking new book, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are — is a game-changer, he claims, with far-reaching implications for psychology and for society.He turns much conventional thinking on its head, controversially calling into question many basic assumptions, such as the value of formal education to change people’s lives.It also undermines the parenting advice industry, the basis of all those groaning shelves of manuals telling us the right way to bring up our children and the disasters that will ensue if we get it wrong.These sell because every parent wants to think they can make a difference to their child, that they can help him or her with reading and arithmetic or teach them how to be kind or conscientious. But, says Plomin, there’s no hard evidence that this is true.On the contrary, our ability to read, to learn, to empathise and so on are all ruled primarily by our genes.Kate\u0027s mission to rescue kids at risk: Duchess of Cambridge...She\u0027s been criticised for taking a stance. But in a personal...Share this articleBeing a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNA.The raw material of our natural selves is what overwhelmingly determines what we can — and cannot — achieve, not how we are brought up. And all those parenting books that promise to deliver developmental outcomes for children are, he maintains, merely ‘peddling snake oil’.If Plomin is right — and he offers an impressive array of research over many years — then dear old Philip Larkin was a grumpy old man not because of his upbringing, but because that tendency was in the genetic blueprint he was born with. The good news, of course, is that his huge talent came from the same source.Chicago-born Plomin’s startling conclusions come from two of his long-term studies. Over the course of 40 years, he tracked 250 adopted children in Colorado along with the birth parents who gave them their genes, and the adoptive parents who raised them. After moving to London in 1994, he launched a 20-year study of more than 12,000 pairs of twins.From these studies, it was possible to unravel the relative importance of genes as opposed to environment when it came to their development.          Being a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNAMillions of pieces of data were amassed from the parents, teachers and the children themselves, about psychological traits such as hyperactivity and inattention, talents such as school achievement and the ability to learn languages, and physical characteristics, such as the propensity to put on weight and become obese.From all this, he found overwhelming evidence that adopted children are similar to their birth parents, not the parents who raised them. Identical twins (ie, from a single egg and therefore with the same DNA) develop much more similarly to each other as compared with non-identical twins (from separate eggs and with different DNA).The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn out.Even stressful life events such as relationship break-ups, financial difficulties and illness don’t have the impact that people generally assume.          The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn outIn fact, what really matters in such situations is our genes, because it is our genes that determine how well or badly an inidual deals with such setbacks. And whether we’re resilient to life’s catastrophes or cave in is determined by our DNA, too.Take orce. Even though the children in a family are all affected, how each inidual deals with it often differs. It is often harder on one sibling than the other(s) — and that difference is because of their different DNA.In fact, Plomin argues, there are genetic influences in virtually everything we do. Those differences determine how we perceive and interpret the world we grow up in, and how we modify our behaviour accordingly.In school, genetic differences in children’s aptitudes and interests, inherited from their parents, affect the extent to which they take advantage of educational opportunities. Similarly, genetic differences in our vulnerability to depression affect the extent to which we interpret experiences we undergo positively or negatively.          Parents, Plomin insists, need to realise ‘that they are not carpenters building a child from scratch‘We can try to force our dreams on them, that they become, for example, a world-class pianist or a star athlete. But we are unlikely to be successful unless we go with the genetic grain.’That, though, still leaves an important role for parents — to find out what their children do well and provide the opportunities for them to do it. What we should not do is try to change them into something they are not.‘Each child is their own person genetically. We need to recognise and respect their genetic differences. If we go against the grain, we run the risk of damaging our relationship with them.’This has positives for parents, too, relieving them of the anxiety and guilt piled on them in how-to parenting manuals.‘These can scare us into thinking that one wrong move can ruin a child for ever.’Plomin hopes his findings will ‘free parents from the illusion that a child’s future success depends on how hard they push them’.And the same, he insists, goes for schools — a theory that challenges the principles on which our education system is based.Schools, he says, matter in that they teach basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. They also dispense fundamental information about history, science, maths and culture. But choice of school makes very little difference to a child’s achievement.‘Genetics is by far the major source of inidual differences in school achievement.’This suggests we should ignore all those league tables of exam results and Ofsted ratings. Plomin argues that differences in schools have very little effect on outcome.This conclusion will inevitably trigger a great debate about the comparative merits of selective grammar schools and non-selective comprehensives.On average, GCSE scores for children in selective schools are a grade higher than in non-selective schools, and this difference is usually assumed to be because selective schools provide better schooling. Genetic research, however, shows that if the best pupils are selected according to the abilities they showed at primary school, they’ll inevitably get better GCSE results.This is because of who they are, not what they’ve learned in the classroom or the way they’ve been taught.Those higher grades are simply a self-fulfilling prophecy.Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16.The ‘value added’ — a measure used by many top schools — turns out to be very small.          The influence of our DNA is not completely confined to our early years when we’re growing upThe same principle applies in the debate about private and state schools. If, as Plomin claims, schools have little effect on inidual differences in achievement, then those 7 per cent of parents who pay huge sums to send their children to private schools in the belief that it will give them an advantage may well be wasting their cash.Plomin writes: ‘Expensive schooling cannot survive a cost–benefit analysis on the basis of school achievement itself.’If your genes fit, you’ll do well and, if they don’t, no amount of cash can change the abilities you’re born with.What all schools should aspire to, he maintains, is to be places where children can learn to enjoy learning for its own sake, rather than frenetically teaching pupils to pass the exams that will improve the school’s standing in league tables.Not that the influence of our DNA is confined to our early years when we’re growing up.Indeed, Plomin shows that it gets stronger as we get older. More and more, we revert to type. Yes, other factors impact on us, such as our relationships with partners, children and friends, our jobs and interests. All contribute to give life meaning.But they don’t fundamentally change who we are psychologically — our personality, our mental health and our cognitive abilities. Good and bad things happen to us, but eventually we rebound to our genetic trajectory. Many people, Plomin acknowledges, will be aghast at his ‘bold conclusion’.It seems to make us automatons, devoid of free will, victims of our DNA. And, indeed, this level of determinism could be an excuse for apathy, a refusal to take responsibility for oneself: ‘Not my fault, guv, it’s my genes!’However, he categorically rejects this notion.Just because you have a genetic propensity to put on weight, for example, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try to lose some pounds.You may have the devil inside you, but you can keep it at bay.Plomin found that his own genetic mapping threw up a surprise.‘I am genetically predisposed to put on the pounds and find it hard to lose them.‘It means I can’t let my guard down and, in those weak moments, give in to those siren snacks in the cupboard whispering to me.’          Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking Plomin said there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16The same applies to anyone with a genetic propensity to depression, learning disabilities or alcohol abuse.‘Genes are not destiny,’ says Plomin. You don’t have to succumb.Controversially, he can see a time soon when DNA information will routinely be on people’s medical records, though he acknowledges that this poses serious dilemmas.Do you want to know if your child has a high genetic risk for schizophrenia when there’s nothing you can do to stop it? On the other hand, he says, many psychological disorders, such as alcohol dependence and anorexia, are difficult to cure.Early warning is good, and preventing problems before they occur is much more cost effective, economically as well as psychologically.It’s also good, he argues, that we can know our limits — those things that our DNA just won’t let happen, however hard we try.Plomin quotes with approval the observation of American comedian W.C. Fields: ‘If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. There’s no use being a damn fool about it.’Because, ultimately, it’s more sensible to go with the genetic flow rather than trying to swim upstream.Equally, our DNA can tell us where our inborn talents lie, so that we do not waste them.There was a telling example this week when former England captain Alastair Cook retired from Test cricket. In tribute, commentator Mike Atherton declared: ‘He made himself the best player he could be he extracted every last ounce of his talent.’Plomin’s radical new world may force us to bow to our genetic limits but, on the plus side, it will encourage us, like Alastair Cook, to do the best we can with the talents we’ve been given.Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are by Robert Plomin will be published by Allen Lane on October 4 at £20. © Robert Plomin 2018.

It’s so sad, because he’s missing out on so much.’Part of the problem is, I believe, that even in the 21st century the image of retirement remains firmly stuck in the past. It feels out of sync in a world that places such a high premium on being purposeful and busy — and where being stressed out is not only the norm, but a marker of success.‘We have become so obsessed over the past few decades with working hard and the idea of being a “go-getter” that retirement — because it’s the antithesis of that — is seen as giving up,’ says Ian Stuart-Hamilton, professor of developmental psychology at the University of South Wales.‘There are more than enough role models now of people who are ploughing on long past retirement age, like the U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett, who’s 88.‘The danger is that once you get trapped into that mindset, retirement then seems like a kind of failure.’So what can we do to change that mindset? Today and next week I will explore how we can, with careful planning and honesty about our long-term goals, turn the potential negatives of retirement into positives.I will look at the thorny issues that trouble those about to retire: how and when to take that all-important step reinventing ourselves for the next phase keeping physically and mentally alert and, yes, rekindling our marriages, too.WINDING DOWN OR A LEAP IN THE DARK?TIME was when the decision about how and when to stop work was easy. The retirement age was fixed at 65 for men and 60 for women, and those milestones remained comfortably in the back of your mind for the whole of your working life.But with a change in the law in 2011 abolishing the default retirement age, the certainties have been swept away.In theory, we can all carry on till we drop. Indeed, the numbers choosing to work on after 65 have doubled to a record 1.19 million over the past ten years.So of all the numerous retirement options that now confront us, which one is best?Phased in: reducing your hours gradually by working part- time before leaving? Cliff-edge: stopping work overnight? Portfolio: a mixture of part-time, consultancy, self-employment andor voluntary work?The list goes on. Should I defer my pension? Should I take it as a lump sum, or as an annuity, or drawdown?Retirement has gone from being a single, easy-to-grasp concept to a mind-boggling mixed bag of possibilities.          So why is it that so many people find retirement unbelievably tough?On the face of it, stopping work overnight sounds like a seriously bad idea. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s true that many retirements get off to a bad start when the change is too sudden. Yet the surprising truth is that for others, it works very well.‘You remember that wonderful feeling when you were a child and the summer holidays seemed to stretch in front of you endlessly?’ says Lily, who took early retirement from the Department for Work and Pensions in Sheffield. ‘That’s how I felt the day after I left work.‘It was as though I’d been given a gift. To begin with it felt like annual leave. But after a few weeks came the realisation that I didn’t have to go back. It was wonderful.’The key to making cliff-edge retirement work is preparation, says Chris Phillipson, professor of sociology and social gerontology at Manchester University.‘The assumption that cliff-edge is bad is just that — an assumption,’ he says. ‘It may not be bad if you’re supported, or it may well be very bad if there is no support.’For others, the idea of weaning yourself off work gradually over a period of months or years is more appealing. There are two ways to do this: either by negotiating phased retirement with your employer, or by leaving your full‑time job and finding new part-time work or self-employment.‘On the whole, it’s been very good,’ says Irene, an administrative assistant who has reduced her days in preparation for her retirement. ‘If I had retired suddenly, it wouldn’t have given me a chance to see what I’m going to do with my time.\u0027I hope he burns in hell!\u0027: Jessica Chambers\u0027 mom visits...Hiic Taco Bell employee is FIRED after she refused to...Share this article‘It’s taken me a while to find new clubs and classes I really like and activities I want to do. Now I’m in the swing of it, I’m really looking forward to retiring.‘Also, if I’d gone for cliff-edge retirement, the money would have been cut off straight away. As it is, I’ve gradually got used to not spending so much.’But phased retirement is not without its flaws. For some people, it turns out to be an unsatisfactory limbo where they end up with a foot in both camps, and not enough time or energy to give their full attention to either.‘It can be difficult because your position in the workplace is immediately changed,’ says Professor Phillipson. ‘You’re half in and half out.‘Some people are comfortable with the changed relationship they have with colleagues, but some aren’t. If that’s the case, they are dragging out a change they might be best doing straight away.’What’s increasingly popular is a mixture of part-time work, paid or unpaid consultancy and volunteering — which hopefully leaves time to have fun, too.With this option there’s a flexibility that allows people to shift the balance between their different activities as their priorities change. Reducing your workload in your main career is a good way of moving into a mixed portfolio.          Look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up childrenSpecific ideas are more useful than vague ambitions. Where will you spend most of your time? What will you be doing? With which friends do you want to socialise? How will weekends differ from weekdays?If you plan to volunteer, work part-time or set up your own business, find out what skills or qualifications you might need.Finally, look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up children. Now is the time to revive them.MANAGE THE TRANSITIONTHE latest research suggests that the best way to cope with retirement is to treat it not as the end of the road, but as a major life transition, on a par with leaving home or facing up to an empty nest.And the good news is that by this stage in their lives, people have what it takes to cope successfully, according to psychology lecturer Dr Oliver Robinson.‘We can learn a lot from previous transitions,’ he says. ‘Many of the same issues come up in major life crises, such as identity, meaning, purpose. If you navigate through a crisis successfully and grow out of it, it should mean you’re well prepared for the next one.’Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, agrees. ‘Retirement can be a dirty word, because people see it as the end a phase where you do nothing,’ she says. ‘If you change jobs, you go from Job A to Job B. But retirement has no B attached. The antidote is to see retirement as a change, rather than a movement towards nothing.’This new and illuminating approach focuses on how the psychological qualities we have developed during previous transitions and throughout our working lives — attributes such as resilience, adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a ‘can-do’ attitude — can stand us in good stead for the challenges of retirement.John, who took two extended breaks from work to go travelling, first in his 30s and then in his 50s, when he went to Barcelona for a few months to learn Spanish and ended up staying away for seven years, is a case in point.‘I think both experiences helped me when it came to preparing for retirement,’ he says. ‘You realise that you have to make things happen. You can’t be passive.’He is so right. It’s true that the happiest retired people are often the ones who are most proactive about looking for interesting stuff to do. If there’s no birdwatching or film club in their area, they don’t hang around they set one up.When one friend of mine retired to the countryside, she really missed her book group. So she bravely went up to anyone she liked the look of and asked if they would like to join hers.If you’re lucky enough to come across someone like this, see them as the true asset they are.IT’S TIME TO CREATE A NEW YOURETIRING involves one of the biggest shifts of identity we ever go through — as momentous as becoming a parent or leaving home. After years of being seen, and of seeing yourself, as a shopkeeper or a nurse or an engineer, you suddenly become an ex-whatever it was. It’s common to feel, as Nadia does, ‘that you’re 60 and you’re just not in the world any more. You don’t matter.’For her, the loss of status she feels is acute.‘I don’t like being invisible when I walk into a room,’ says Nadia. ‘At work you have a formal place to assert yourself. You get paid.          Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you‘Then all that structure is shipped away and you’re left just sort of flapping around, saying: “I used to be a . . .”‘Everything you’ve built up throughout your career disappears, and suddenly you’re just another old lady looking to do a bit of volunteering.’For women in particular, work bestows an independent identity quite separate from home and family life. When that disappears — and it often coincides with losing the hands-on parenting role — it can leave people feeling doubly discombobulated.It may be that you don’t even want to think about a new identity before you retire. But if you are aware that work dominates your life (or your partner’s) to the exclusion of other interests, it’s worth starting to develop at least one new activity beforehand.Supportive networks that run parallel to work and that will continue beyond it can be a huge help.People will start to see you not just as a brilliant brain surgeon, but as a wicked darts player or a fine guitarist.Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you.It’s also important to reinforce this new identity with other people. Rather than apologetically saying: ‘I used to be a . . .’ when asked what you do, it feels much more positive to say: ‘I’m studying astronomy,’ or ‘I’m planning to start a rag-rugging business.’Soon, other people in your immediate circle and beyond will get used to seeing you in a new light, and that, in turn, reinforces your own new view of yourself.Liz, who retired two years ago, got round the problem by telling people she was taking ‘a pause’, rather than that she had finished work. ‘If you tell people you’re retired, their eyes glaze over a bit — especially younger people,’ she says. ‘I didn’t enjoy the glazing.‘However, when I started exploring a new part of myself and tried out different things I really enjoyed, I became comfortable with the idea of a different identity. Now I’m happy to say I’m retired.’It’s a process that happens organically, but sometimes it needs a bit of a push.As your work persona gradually recedes, it leaves space for a different side of life to take centre stage, and you can spend more time on activities that resonate with your core values.

But I am beginning to doubt it.Indeed, I believe that Mrs May could be on the verge of securing the greatest triumph of her political career.Although cynics predict that her visit to Salzburg on Wednesday will end in tears, I have spoken to well-informed sources close to the British and European sides of the Brexit negotiating teams and detect signs of a breakthrough. There\u0027s a mood of optimism — of friendship even.Revealed: The election speech Theresa May wanted to deliver...Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleThere\u0027s a quiet, but growing, belief that the British Prime Minister is close to striking a remarkable deal. Of course, that won\u0027t happen in Salzburg. There could well be a confected row between the 27 other EU leaders and Mrs May. That would be designed to give the impression that Brussels won\u0027t be a pushover on Brexit.However, no one can deny that the rudiments for a deal exist. And it\u0027s one that would enable Britain to leave the EU on reasonable terms.Let me explain how this has been achieved. Until recent weeks, our negotiators have been struggling against a Brussels bureaucracy fronted by intransigent chief negotiator Michel Barnier, supported by the clapped-out Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.          Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May welcomes Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, to 10 Downing Street in London in June 25, 2018Confronting them has been like negotiating with a wall of flint.No wonder talks repeatedly foundered.It didn\u0027t help that Barnier\u0027s relationship with David Davis, before he stood down as Brexit Secretary, was toxic.For her part, Mrs May should be able to bypass the wretched Barnier and Juncker. She will deal directly with French leader Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Both of them are realists. Not only are they aware that it\u0027s in their countries\u0027 best interests not to treat Britain badly, but that Mrs May deserves decent terms for us departing the EU.Merkel has been told forcefully by Germany\u0027s manufacturers that it is vital for them not to face unnecessary hurdles selling products to their biggest market — Britain. If that means, for example, importing British-made Range Rovers and Nissans freely in exchange for exporting their own BMWs and Mercedes, so be it.Of course Mrs May will come under intense pressure to water down her so-called Chequers proposals. EU negotiators will endeavour to force Britain to keep access to European markets on condition that we sign up to European single market rules and regulations. Britain will also be told to keep paying tens of billions of pounds into EU coffers.But as far as Mrs May is concerned, some of these concessions would be worth it rather than risk Britain exiting with no deal.A successful outcome would be an unmitigated triumph for our embattled Prime Minister.It would also prove wrong all those who have likened her Chequers strategy to a dodo.Barnier, Juncker, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair, Vince Cable and her detractors in the media would all have to eat humble pie.          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, (middle right) embraces British Prime Minister Theresa May (middle left) after a meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels Oct 16, 2017Some, such as the most dyspeptic hard-line Tory Brexiteers, would, of course, refuse. They would unsheath daggers at next month\u0027s Conservative Party conference and hurl shouts of \u0027betrayal\u0027.But the truth is that such a Brexit deal with the EU would honour Mrs May\u0027s promise to the British people that Brexit would mean a free trade area for goods no more free movement of people across our border leaving the Common Agricultural Policy taking back control of UK waters by quitting the Common Fisheries Policy supremacy for UK courts and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice.This weekend, the Tory Brexit rebels are gravely weakened. The first sign of this emerged when their European Research Group (ERG) faction failed to put forward cogent proposals for how Britain would survive outside the EU if Mrs May\u0027s Chequers deal collapsed. Also, all the foment about a leadership challenge to Mrs May proved to be nothing but a mirage.Furthermore, awkward questions are being asked about the funding of the ERG, with a possible investigation by parliamentary watchdogs into a secret bank account used to pay for wining and dining supporters.While these high-stakes politics are being played out, it is vital to remember that the referendum ballot paper in June 2016 asked voters to make a simple choice: whether they wanted to remain in, or leave, the European Union.There were no stated terms on which Britain might leave.Considering the way politics has descended into the gutter during the 27 months since then, Theresa May has climbed bravely to near the pinnacle of the mountain.How apposite that, next week, it will be beside the majestic Alps, in Salzburg, that she might start to believe that an honourable Brexit is finally within reach.  Cook\u0027s first-class retirement           Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket after playing for more than a decade at the top of his professionEvery leading politician should learn from the dignified way that Alastair Cook retired this week from Test cricket.After playing for more than a decade at the top of his profession, he will continue to turn out for his Essex county team for another three years.What a contrast with both Tony Blair and David Cameron, who abruptly abandoned the House of Commons after standing down as prime minister.This point was well made by Labour MP Chris Bryant, who said that the two men should have remained in front-line politics to offer the benefit of their years of experience.In previous ages, ex-prime ministers often stayed on as MPs. A notable example was first-class cricketer Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who served as foreign secretary in the Heath government for four years after he lost the 1964 General Election as PM.Intriguingly it was Sir Alec who once famously said, years before Britain joined what was then the Common Market, that the embryonic union of European countries was \u0027a dead duck that could not quack\u0027!  Despite their shrill accusations about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, the Tories have a serious anti-Semitism problem of their own.This was disgracefully demonstrated by Conservative MEPs\u0027 support for the hard-Right Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, who has waged a long, vicious vendetta against the Jewish philanthropist George Soros, accusing him of plotting to take control of the country.Orban has made inflammatory comments about Muslims and hailed a Hungarian leader who collaborated with the Nazis during the Holocaust as \u0027an outstanding statesman\u0027.This week, Conservative MEPs opposed a motion in the European Parliament which condemned Orban for attacking minorities and suppressing free speech and press freedom. They were the only governing party in Western Europe to do so.Although Theresa May\u0027s spokesman dissociated her from her colleagues\u0027 vote, I cannot believe that Tory MEPs would have acted in this way without covert approval from No 10.If this is the case, it is a most misguided policy. For at a time when Brexit talks are in the balance, Mrs May needs every morsel of support from fellow European leaders, and must not offend them by linking Britain with the odious Orban. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/14/19DD622C00000514-0-image-m-19_1536930123649.jpg","title":"British intelligence chiefs thought former Labour leader Michael Foot paid Soviet informant","story":"    Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg GordievskyMI6 believed claims made by a Soviet defector that former Labour leader Michael Foot was a paid KGB contact, according to a new book.Intelligence chiefs were reportedly briefed on the politician’s KGB history in 1982 and were prepared to pass on the information to the Queen had he become prime minister after the following year’s general election.Allegations of Mr Foot’s links to Soviet intelligence, made by double-agent Oleg Gordievsky, were first published in the Sunday Times 23 years ago. At the time he dismissed the claims as a ‘big lie’ and successfully sued the paper for libel.But documents, published in The Spy and the Traitor, show that MI6 thought the evidence presented by Mr Gordievsky was strong enough to pass on to the Queen.In a 1982 debriefing, the former agent allegedly said the KGB had paid Mr Foot the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money, according to the new book.Even though he was supposedly paid by the Soviets, Mr Gordievsky said that the politician was not a ‘spy or conscious agent’.Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleInstead he was allegedly a contact who was paid for ‘disinformation purposes’, meaning he might have been fed false information.Mr Foot lost the 1983 election to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party, helped in large part by Britain’s victory in the Falklands War.Author Ben Macintyre wrote: ‘Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election. It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the Queen would have to be informed.’           The double agent (pictured) said that the Labour leader was an informant for the KGB  MI6 chiefs were so concerned about Michael Foot\u0027s (pictured, right) alleged links to the KGB that they were prepared to pass information onto the Queen  (pictured, left, in 1982) The journalist also revealed that the information was ‘too politically incendiary’ to show to Margaret Thatcher.The allegations made against Mr Foot were detailed in a 400-page file labelled ‘Agent Boot’.The word ‘agent’ is believed to have been later crossed out when Mr Foot was demoted to a ‘confidential contact’. The file claims Mr Foot was first contacted by Soviet intelligence while working at the left-wing magazine Tribune in the 1940s.Mr Gordievsky also made claims about how the Soviet secret services had infiltrated other factions of the Labour Party, which had become increasingly left-wing in the early 1980s.The party’s 1983 election manifesto, which outlined several socialist policies, was later dubbed ‘the longest suicide note in history’ by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Mr Foot resigned following the election defeat and three years as Labour leader. He died in 2010 aged 96.Trade union leader Jack Jones was also listed as an ‘agent’ by Mr Gordievsky. The spy claimed he met Mr Jones for lunch, but found him ‘absolutely useless’ as a contact.Mr Gordievsky became a double-agent for MI6 in the 1970s, later rising to be head of the KGB’s London station in the early 1980s. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/12/4EBC9D5E00000578-0-image-a-14_1533121538202.jpg","title":"New eSports degree university students play computer games coursework","story":"    Students at the University of Chichester will pay total fees of £27,750 before living costs  be required to play FIFA, Counter- Strike, League of Legends and Project Cars as part of the degree.

A home that, she says, holds so many happy memories.Josie today is a successful textile artist and she’s turned her old bedroom into a studio. She refuses to dwell on the horrific events that would seem utterly insurmountable to most of us: ‘I don’t remember very much, she said. ‘We just carried on with life. We went out and did normal teenage stuff. I’m not a victim, I’m not a survivor. I’m just me.’Asked how she overcame the tragedy she added: ‘I think being really, really busy. I just get on with life and just carry on. I love my job, it’s all fine. Happy.’Josie’s story came in the week one report said that a quarter of teenage girls are suffering from depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. Another shockingly revealed that one in four 14-year-old girls self-harm.I am not for a moment denigrating these girls who are clearly suffering, subjected as they are to many pressures — not least the constant hateful judgment of their peers on social media.My point is that Josie gives them hope. She proves you can overcome adversity, no matter how terrible. Far from indulging in victimhood and self-pity, she is determined to make the best of her life.Her greatest joy today, apart from planning life with her fiancé, is her Mum’s pony, Rosie, which she used to ride as a child. ‘Now Rosie’s quite old, I take her for walks,’ she said.What a tribute she is to her father Shaun.

Of the Princess, he said: ‘I told her before anything had happened it would end in a lot of pain for us both, but it would be a lot of fun along the way.’ Fun for the women-magnet Hoare perhaps, but not for the two women he left heartbroken.   Joanna still Ab FabBefore she took to the Silk Road on ITV this week, some wondered how Joanna Lumley (below), now 72, would manage the gruelling 7,000-mile journey from Venice to China.She was, as always, sublime.

I’ll drink to that.   As the new face of M\u0026ampS, Holly Willoughby proudly wears clothes from the High Street giant, despite being worth £21million.

Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets. Tunes like Bouff Daddy, Did You See and the title track are carnivals of ideas, and the east Londoner is comfortable rapping sensitively, playfully or aggressively over any style he’s given. The focus, though, is always on his extraordinary life that’s featured a multiple stabbing. It’s the unique sound of modern multicultural London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bab2e636b092a731208ebb4acfa8f86fcf8354d/0_722_2362_1416/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e53765d69062569faca63038dc1fd39","title":"mary kelly artist interview face to face","story":"The US conceptual artist on protest movements of the moment, inequality in the art world, and where she finds hopeBorn in Iowa in 1941, artist Mary Kelly has been creating works from a feminist and postmodern perspective for the past 50 years, often using compressed lint from her tumble dryer. She has lived in Florence, Beirut and London, and now lives in Los Angeles, where she teaches at the University of Southern California. Her installation Post-Partum Document, an exploration of the relationship between mother and child, caused furore for displaying stained nappies at the ICA in the mid-70s. Kelly’s latest exhibition, Face-to-Face, is at Pippy Houldsworth Gallery, London, from Thursday to 3 November.Tell us about your forthcoming exhibition Face-to-Face…This show is a little unusual for me: it’s a survey of works I’ve done related to war and violence since 1966, a 50-year period. I feel that the subject has become more intensely central to how I think at the moment. The title draws on Emmanuel Levinas, who talks about the face as the site of your ethical decision-making: it’s the point where you recognise “the other” and their vulnerability, and is also the moment where it is impossible to kill someone.You’ve done a lot of work based around the protests of 1968, and the Arab spring in 2011 – do you feel similarly inspired by the protests of the last few years?The Million Women march was a wonderful and exciting moment. I haven’t done a work about that I’m not a journalist responding to every issue. I will have to distil those facts and try to filter them into a rather more personal story. But the way we return to those moments, it’s not as though things are finished – these issues are never over, you have to continually address them.What’s going through your mind when you’re putting on load 6,743?Good question... “How can I get someone else to do this for me?”Do you think male and female artists are treated differently?It varies, of course, but there are differences. One is that – and for people of colour this would be the same – it can look like the problem is being addressed, but it is more of a turnover at the bottom at the highest level, if you want to call the highest level something that’s endorsed by the market and the museums, it’s the same. And I’ve noticed that the way some women have been written about, it’s always about the work in question. There’s not the same riff they do for the men, which is to say where they came from, how they’re connected, who they influenced. They don’t give them a historical presence.Are you worried about how closing borders will affect artists’ minds and work?I think it’s devastating. Living all over very different places gives you insight about how different cultures and political systems work, but it also shows you in some way how things are connected. I think that all borders are anathema to art. Internationalism is, I believe, always connected to movements that are progressive and the opposite goes for closing down.Where do you find hope?That is difficult. In combination with the perpetual war and the rise of authoritarian populism all over the place, it doesn’t look good. But there’s also so many movements: #MeToo and the unbelievably brilliant students that demonstrated about gun violence after the shootings. I think if I see any hope it’s in the current generation of women of colour: they are just on fire. If you look at most of the demonstrations and organisations that are active right now, the spokesperson is usually a young black woman, and that is hopeful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b8a02bac731dae72c77b623c3418b974defd9cf/0_356_5340_3204/master/5340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b14e486cf2ed8f53e0071ae38b84646","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Daily life in Pyongyang, Hurricane Florence, protests in Gaza and Serena Williams at the US Open in New York – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b071f0ead85332dcb8bb8fc18ec7e8eb6bfc1d5/0_247_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3ae5a65b31f67bcf8736d5ffaa2a6a8","title":"french bookshops revolt after prize selects novel self published on amazon","story":"Booksellers refuse to ‘jump into the wolf’s mouth’ and order Marco Koskas’ Renaudot-longlisted novel onlineFrench booksellers have called on literary judges to “defend books and not those who threaten them”, after one of France’s most prestigious prizes selected a self-published novel available only via Amazon.Among the 17 titles in contention for this year’s Prix Renaudot is Marco Koskas’ Bande de Français, which was self-published on Amazon’s CreateSpace platform. According to the Syndicat de la librairie française, which represents French booksellers, the jury have put them in an impossible position.The French-Israeli author, who has published more than a dozen books via more traditional routes, told the  he was forced into put out an edition of Bande de Français himself after no French publisher picked it up.“As I didn’t want to bow down to this decision,” Koskas said, “in the end I decided to self-publish. Otherwise I might have gone into some sort of literary hiding.”The novel is only available for sale through the internet giant, so according to the Syndicat, it is “technically and commercially almost impossible” for bookshops to put it on their shelves.“Morally, above all, they refuse to ‘jump into the wolf’s mouth’,” the Syndicat said in a statement. Amazon, it said, not only wants to become “a major player in the book market, it wants to become the market itself by eliminating its competitors, organising unfair competition, avoiding tax and replacing publishers, distributors and bookshops in one fell swoop”.The Syndicat warned that including Bande de Français on the Renaudot longlist “does a disservice to the author himself, as well as to booksellers, and is a worrying sign for the future of book creation and distribution”.Far from fearing that the jury had done him a disservice, Koskas declared himself “amused and proud” to find himself picked out, adding that the Syndicat’s call for him to be excluded was a “great lack of fair play, not to say blackmail”.Bookshops should not be angry with him, he said, nor with the Renaudot jury, but with the publishers who “made a mistake about my book” – a decision he suggested stems from an anti-Israel sentiment that he says is strong in France.“I know that booksellers cannot turn against all the publishers who rejected me – there are too many,” he said. “But they’re turning against Amazon, who published me. That makes no sense. Amazon offers authors a much more flexible contract than publishers, and above all, Amazon has no literary opinion. That is important. They do not get involved with what I write. They don’t ask for money to print my book, and they are paid, like any matchmaker, when the product sells. What do I have to complain about?”Renaudot jury member and author Patrick Besson defended the choice of Bande de Français in Le Point, calling the novel “one of the most original, the most interesting”, of the autumn season. “It tells of the life of French Jews who emigrated to Israel,” he said. “It has a freshness … It’s intelligent. I devoured it.”Besson said he had not noticed that the book was self-published via Amazon, and that he was only interested in the text.Koskas said that he likes having bookshops on the high street and hopes they survive. “But if they are bookshops where you can’t find my books, when I have spent my life writing books, well, let’s say that I am becoming less sympathetic to booksellers’ plight,” he added.According to the French author Laurent Binet, it’s easy to understand why bookshops are up in arms. For booksellers, the issue was not so much that the book was self-published, he said, but that it was published through Amazon.“For us, literary prizes have an enormous impact and generate a lot of sales, so the stakes are high,” he said. “In France, our bookshops are doing better than elsewhere because of a very restrictive book policy … and also thanks to our attachment to paper books. The sale of ebooks is still marginal. But this relative good health is fragile, and it would take little to destabilise it. And Amazon is clearly seen as the No 1 threat. The move from the Renaudot is seen as a sort of Amazon Trojan horse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a06a4a6f33b1d7d9e4b5865663b563e974d4621/0_236_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80dbf0749ed4735f3e19fdec46714537","title":"the 50 biggest books of autumn 2018","story":"From Haruki Murakami to Michelle Obama, what to read this seasonThe Silence of the Girls by Pat BarkerHamish Hamilton The Trojan war has been revisited many times since Homer now women’s voices come to the fore at last. The author of the Regeneration trilogy is one of our finest modern chroniclers of war, and her latest book is a retelling of the Iliad from the point of view of Briseis, the queen who becomes Achilles’s slave after her family is slaughtered. This magisterial novel is both a timely exploration of power, misogyny and violence and an elegant counternarrative to one of literature’s founding conflicts.Normal People by Sally RooneyFaber Longlisted for the Man Booker prize, the twentysomething Irish writer’s second novel more than fulfils the precocious promise of last year’s debut Conversations With Friends. It’s an old story – a will-they-won’t-they romance between two young people, who are coming of age and trying to find out how they fit into the world around them – but written with a sharp contemporary flavour and in an exquisitely witty, economical style. The pressures of class, family and society crowd in, but it’s Rooney’s ability to illuminate intimacy and interiority that really shines.Transcription by Kate AtkinsonDoubledayThe much-loved author returns with a world war two spy novel that has enormous fun with the conventions of the genre while bringing scrupulous research and rigorous empathy to the tribulations of the war. Recruited by MI5 to transcribe meetings between undercover agents and fascist sympathisers, Juliet is an innocent caught up in a cloak-and-dagger world that combines arch theatricality with the daily grind. Everyone gets hoodwinked – including the reader.Love Is Blind by William BoydVikingBoyd often showcases an era through the portrait of an inidual. In his globetrotting 15th novel, we follow a young Scottish piano tuner, Brodie Moncur, who escapes stuffy Edinburgh for the excitement of Paris at the dawn of the 20th century, where he falls head over heels for a Russian singer, as Boyd explores the vagaries of fate, chance and the human heart.Melmoth by Sarah PerrySerpent’s Tail (2 October)The eagerly awaited follow-up to The Essex Serpent is a much darker beast: a modern response to Charles Maturin’s 1820 gothic classic Melmoth the Wanderer, and a meditation on moral responsibility in the face of atrocity. An English translator, hiding from her past in Prague, uncovers the legend of Melmoth – a woman in black who wanders the world bearing witness to humanity’s worst crimes. Perry’s customary tender characterisation and wit combine with oodles of gothic atmosphere for a singular ghost story.Killing Commendatore by Haruki Murakami, translated by Ted Goossen and Philip GabrielHarvill Secker (9 October)A new novel from the world-conquering Japanese author is always an event. His first in four years focuses on a Tokyo portrait painter who is hiding away in the mountain retreat of a famous artist after his wife demands a orce: there he discovers a painting in the attic which bends reality into strange new shapes. Murakami ponders art, war and, as ever, loneliness, as a ringing bell, a mysterious well and various odd characters lead his antihero on a voyage of self-discovery.Bridge of Clay by Markus ZusakDoubleday (11 October)It’s 11 years since the Australian author’s YAcrossover novel The Book Thief was published in the UK, where it has sold 1m copies. This adult follow-up is the story of five young brothers who have been living without grownups, awaiting the return of their father and poised to discover the secret behind his disappearance. Expect insights into family, forgiveness and literature, in a tale with echoes of John Irving.Unsheltered by Barbara KingsolverFaber (18 October)The Orange prize winner’s eighth novel features two people 150 years apart who stand against society’s prevailing winds. In 2016, Willa watches the rise of Trump with horror in 1871, science teacher Thatcher brings the ideas of Darwin to a small town that doesn’t want to be challenged by them. Kingsolver uses her dual narrative to interrogate both the madness of societies and the inidual’s power to resist.Red Birds by Mohammed HanifBloomsbury (18 October)British Pakistani writer Mohammed Hanif erupted on to the literary scene with A Case of Exploding Mangoes in 2008. His new novel, set in and around a refugee camp in an unnamed country occupied by the US, exhibits his trademark black comedy. The narrators are a US pilot forced to crash land on his way to bombing the camp, a young would-be entrepreneur whose aid worker is writing a book on the teenage Muslim mind, and a philosophical dog, it’s an absurdist riff on modern conflict with shades of Catch-22.Middle England by Jonathan CoeViking (8 November)The man who skewered Thatcherism in What a Carve Up! leads us along the sorry road to Brexit. Middle England runs from 2010 to the present, and examines a ided country through characters from his earlier novels The Rotters’ Club and The Closed Circle, now deep into middle age, and their precarious progeny. From post-industrial Birmingham to the London riots and the current political gridlock, it takes in family, literature and love in a comedy for our times.The Spy and the Traitor by Ben MacintyreViking (20 September)Macintyre specialises in a kind of Boy’s Own non-fiction, books about espionage and derring do that usually hit the top of the bestseller charts. He has now turned his attention to Oleg Gordievsky, the most important British agent of the cold war, in a book that John le Carré has blurbed as “the best true spy story I have ever read”. Gordievsky, a KGB officer, spied for MI6 for 11 years when he was recalled to Moscow, British intelligence helped him to escape back to the UK. It’s a thrilling story and it’s certainly a good moment to write about Russian spies.My Thoughts Exactly by Lily AllenBlink (20 September)The singer, songwriter and strong Twitter presence hopes to appeal to celebrity memoir fans with a revealing book set to include discussions of “feminism, the tabloids, money, faking orgasms, bad managers, fame, sexual abuse, mental health, narcissism, motherhood, stalking and parking tickets”. Her most recent album depicted the collapse of her marriage. Expect more of that here, along with sparky, forthright stories of drink and drugs and growing up in the limelight.Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World by William DaviesJonathan Cape (20 September)Davies, a rising star in the world of political thought, has written a much-needed book that provides an original explanatory framework for our current predicament – Trump and Brexit included. In a study full of contemporary examples, but which begins in the 17th century, Davies argues that populists shouldn’t be attacked for being “post-truth” and “emotional” we should recognise, he argues, that it is the speed of life in the digital era that is making public debate increasingly instinctive and warlike.Our Boys: The Story of a Paratrooper by Helen ParrAllen Lane (26 September)At the centre of the outstanding Our Boys is the story of Dave Parr, the author’s uncle, who died on the final day of the Falklands war. An exploration of conflict, “manliness” and Britain’s changing relationship with its soldiers, it foregrounds the experiences of people who lived through the conflict, and contrasts the expectations put on an elite regiment with the shocking and awful reality of combat. Our Boys is an non-judgmental book, as moving as it is thoughtful.Thomas Cromwell: A Life by Diarmaid MacCullochAllen Lane (27 September)By the end of the 1530s Cromwell, a self-made “ruffian” as he described himself, was effectively running the country for Henry VIII. It was one of the most momentous eras in English history, and the king’s chief minister was central to the religious break with Rome, unprecedented use of parliament and the dissolution of all monasteries. Much of this historical story, however significant, would be arcane for the ordinary reader were it not for the brilliance of Hilary Mantel’s fictional treatment in Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies (the last book in the trilogy is expected next year). Mantel has said that MacCulloch’s heavyweight biography is the one “we have been awaiting for 400 years”. It is as stylishly written as it is scholarly.The Fifth Risk by Michael LewisAllen Lane (2 October)In the hands of a different author, and at a less astonishing time, the subject of this book might seem unpromising: an investigation into the US departments of energy, agriculture and commerce. But Lewis has written Moneyball and The Big Short and knows how to uncover the terrific, page-turning stories that lurk within big institutions – in this case the catastrophic risks that result from the Trump administration’s ignorance, neglect and undermining of government. Bureaucracy has rarely seemed so important.Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen HawkingJohn Murray (16 October)The cosmologist’s A Brief History of Time has now sold more than 13m copies. This final book, comprising reflections from his archive, was under discussion at the time of Hawking’s death in March. The questions are big indeed, and include everything from “alien intelligence, and the existence of God to the importance of space colonisation, and the perils and promise of artificial intelligence”.Murder by the Book by Claire HarmanViking (25 October)The body of Lord William Russell, his throat cut, was discovered in his Mayfair townhouse in May 1840. He was a former politician and member of a famous family and his murder caused a huge scandal and was investigated by the fledgling politan police. Award-winning biographer Harman focuses on the killer’s claim to have been inspired by a sensational novel, and the debate about fiction that ensued. Her publishers must be hoping readers of The Suspicions of Mr Whicher will be drawn to an equally shocking but more literary crime.Heavy: An American Memoir by Kiese LaymonBloomsbury (1 November)The American writer has apparently been at work on this memoir since he was 11. It is addressed to his mother, who rose from poverty to become a professor of political science, and recounts Laymon’s experiences of sexual violence, racism, gambling and obesity – he weighed 300lb as a teenager. At its centre is his body, and what it is to be a black man in the US. Laymon’s essays have attracted much attention: this set of reflections, in which he attempts “to name secrets and lies that he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding”, has been long awaited.Becoming by Michelle ObamaViking (13 November)Barack and Michelle Obama announced last year that they were both writing memoirs the joint deal for the books was reportedly worth $60m. The former first lady is the first to finish and she follows in the footsteps of nearly all her predecessors since Lady Bird Johnson in producing a post-White House autobiography. Not much has been revealed of Becoming: Obama has said she will “talk about my roots and how a little girl from the South Side of Chicago found her voice”. The memoir, a major publishing event, will consider how she dealt with being a working mother under “an unforgiving media glare”.Lethal White by Robert GalbraithSphere (18 September)In the fourth mystery from JK Rowling’s alter ego, Cormoran Strike investigates a troubled young man’s story of a crime he witnessed as a child.Tombland by CJ SansomMantle (18 October)Tudor investigator Matthew Shardlake’s seventh outing takes him to Norwich, where he finds himself caught up in Kett’s rebellion, a peasants’ revolt of 1549.Wild Fire by Ann Cleeves MacmillanThe eighth and final novel in Cleeves’s Shetland series sees DI Jimmy Perez investigate the death of a young nanny working for English incomers.The House on Vesper Sands by Paraic O’Donnell Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson (18 October)This literary mystery is a compelling, darkly funny portrait of late Victorian London, and focuses on crimes with a supernatural flavour.In A House of Lies by Ian Rankin Orion (4 October)Rebus just keeps rolling on: the retired DI returns to help a former colleague solve a case with its roots in the past.Red Moon by Kim Stanley RobinsonOrbit (25 October)A few decades from now we have colonised the moon, in this thoughtful thriller about space exploration and political revolutions on earth.Elevation by Stephen KingHodder \u0026amp Stoughton (30 October)King’s late flowering continues with an understated novella about a man beset by a mysterious affliction.How Long ’Til Black Future Month? by NK JemisinOrbit (29 November)In the first collection of short fiction from a triple Hugo award-winner, dragons haunt post-Katrina New Orleans and a mother struggles with a spirit in the deep south.Thin Air by Richard MorganGollancz (25 October)A bodyguard packing military-grade body tech finds murder and corruption as commercial interests collide on Mars, in the latest from the author of Altered Carbon.Rosewater by Tade ThompsonOrbit (20 September)UK publication for this award-winning tale of an alien biodome which lands in near-future Nigeria.Into the Jungle by Katherine RundellBloomsbury (20 September)Origin stories for the characters of Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book are interwoven in a clever framing narrative by the Costa-winning author of The Explorer, with lush illustrations from Kristjana S Williams.And the Ocean Was Our Sky by Patrick NessWalkerA retelling of Moby-Dick from the perspective of Bathsheba and her human-hunting whale pod, with illustrations by Rovina Cai.The Skylarks’ War by Hilary McKayMacmillan (20 September)Clarry and Peter are love-starved.

A compelling icy adventure from the author of The Island at the End of Everything.Cassandra Darke by Posy SimmondsJonathan Cape (1 November)In Simmonds’s latest clever, nuanced, warm-hearted satire a heartless art dealer makes a discovery in her Chelsea basement that pushes her out of a grim rut and into a dark quest.Heimat: A German Family Album by Nora KrugParticular (4 October)Krug probes her family’s actions in Nazi Germany, conducting interviews and roaming archives and flea markets. She confronts past and present in a book that’s been praised for its invention and bravery.Passing for Human by Liana FinckJonathan Cape (20 September)You can get a taste of Finck via her darkly moreish Instagram account, but it’s worth ing deep into her second graphic novel. A beautiful, fictionalised memoir combines intelligence and appealingly scratchy artwork with serious soul-searching.Berlin: City of Light by Jason LutesDrawn \u0026amp Quarterly In the third volume of Lutes’s interwar epic, the Nazis are in power. The personal and political have been woven tight throughout the trilogy, mixing riots, cabaret, communism and noirish artwork.Tales from the Inner City by Shaun TanWalker Studio (25 September)Tan’s weird, wild books often defy categorisation. Here short stories blend with art showing luminous fish and skyscraper-dwelling deer strangeness doesn’t lurk below the surface but stands blinking in the city’s bright lights.Sincerity by Carol Ann DuffyPicador (1 November)Duffy’s final collection as poet laureate lays bare the complexity of both the personal and the public realms, through elegiac reflections and caustic exposure of the political deceptions of our turbulent times.Old Toffer’s Book of Consequential Dogs by Christopher ReidFaber (27 September)Reid takes up TS Eliot’s idea for a follow-up to Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, with deft wit and expertise revealing the sheer joy to be found in the best light verse.As Slow as Possible by Kit FanArc (20 September)From a reworking of the book of Genesis drawing on Chinese mythology to astute studies of Velázquez and Zurbarán, Fan’s work is wide ranging, sharp-eyed and thought-provoking.Running Upon the Wires by Kate TempestPicadorAs one love affair ends and another begins, Tempest renders the heightened emotions with her customary blend of arresting rhythm and linguistic energy.Hell by Alasdair GrayCanongate (4 October)The first part of Dante’s Divine Comedy filtered through Gray’s unique visual and verbal imagination, or, as he puts it, “Decorated and Englished in Prosaic Verse”.Can We All Be Feminists? edited by June Eric-UdorieVirago (27 September)Writers and thinkers from erse backgrounds interrogate race, religion and class and ask what can be done to make feminism more inclusive.The Apprentice: Trump, Russia and the Subversion of American Democracy by Greg MillerWilliam Collins (2 October)Pulitzer prize–winning reporter Miller investigates the Kremlin’s covert efforts to stop Hillary Clinton and elect Trump, which resulted in the 2016 presidential election being described as the political crime of the century.Identity by Francis FukuyamaProfile (4 October) Fukuyama explores the rise of identity politics, assesses the tensions created in liberal democracies by demands that are not solely economic, and asks what might be lost in a rejection of universal forms of recognition.The Future of Capitalism by Paul CollierAllen Lane (4 October)Across the west societies are becoming increasingly ided both economically and politically.

OK, I’ve paraphrased slightly. The Amazon boss has launched something called the Day One fund, which feels like the will-this-do title for the will-this-do initiative it is. Bezos has long been criticised for his glaring lack of a philanthropic arm, long after he became the richest man in modern history. A year ago Jeff seemed at such a loss as to how not to be an unmitigated arse that he was asking internet users for ideas. He seems to have ignored all the respondents who said, “Stop treating your workers like rubbish.”Do you remember the beginning of Verhoeven’s Robocop, before things started to go really tits-up in increasingly automated future Detroit? There’s a company that basically does everything, called Omni Consumer Products. They begin providing services that might reasonably be imagined the job of the state. A movie ensues. Anyway, here we are. Fresh from announcing that Amazon’s getting into healthcare, Jeff has decided to help homeless people and low-income communities with donations and not-for-profit schools.“We’ll use the same set of principles that have driven Amazon,” he explains, encouragingly. “The child will be the customer.” Mmm. Customers who bought this nonsense also bought the line that Elon Musk is a humanitarian, and that Mark Zuckerberg went to crucial early-primary states last year because he wanted to “share stories” with ordinary Americans.Off the top of my head, Jeff has already had two very clear chances to help homeless people and low-income families. The first was in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, and where the firm recently killed a proposed city tax on big firms to alleviate the homeless crisis by threatening to halt a building project. The second was by simply paying his own low-income workers better. As the old saying goes, charity begins in aisle 89 of the Amazon warehouse, where workers are so terrified of being docked points for nipping to the bathroom that they’re pissing in bottles.But guys like Jeff don’t want governments, or properly paid worker ants, taking credit for what is, after all, his bounty. The rule you learn on Day One of being a billionaire philanthropist is that you don’t give money via pay packets to the poor people who literally already work for you. They’d only spend it poorly. However, if they want to humbly queue up and apply for it via some thinly disguised hardship grant that you take the applause for, that’s a different matter. Dignity is something you hand out, not something that others get to earn. I missed this bit in The Wealth of Nations I guess there’s a sealed section.And the warm glow doesn’t even end there for you. There is an entire industry of confected philanthropic awards set up to honour givers such as Jeff. The rest of us need simply wait for the first story of an Amazon worker who has to throw themselves on the mercy of Bezos’s charitable arm in order to bump themselves up to living-wage territory. Consider that the ouroboros of giving a toss. Maybe the story will appear in the Washington\u0026nbspPost, the totemically revered newspaper Bezos owns, and which he receives a ridiculous amount of credit for simply leaving editorially alone. And maybe it won’t.There is, of course, a third way in which all the tech gazillionaires who want to make the world a better place could do so, but from which they all somehow seem to recoil: tax! Last year Amazon’s UK profits trebled but its tax bill fell.How can anyone who doesn’t pay decent tax be referred to as a “philanthropist”? Sorry to bring Jeff and all the others down to the level of the little people – the nurses and teachers and bricklayers and so on – who do pay a proper whack of their meagre salaries toward the societies in which we all, including Jeff, live. But you don’t get to order turbo-accountants to chisel every last legally loopholed cent off your responsibilities, then swan in with a tiny percentage of what you’ve saved and expect to be treated like the effing messiah.Looked at in the round, Jeff is just another emissary of that specific class who make you ill just so they can sell you the cure. See also Gwyneth Paltrow, whose Goop website is always detailing madam’s various health issues, then trying to flog the fringe lunacies that presumably cause half of them. And see also the Conservative party, who’ve spent the past few years breaking everything then telling you only they can fix it.The greatest trick all this lot ever pulled is convincing\u0026nbsppeople that they are the answer, as opposed to the problem. Incredible to think that as recently as 10\u0026nbspminutes ago, people were still chummily tweeting Musk along the lines of, “Counting on you to get us to Mars and escape Trump, dude!”Guys? Elon’s not going to save you. Elon’s going to call you a “pedo” if you have the temerity to rescue some kids without using his non-bendy mini-submarine. Elon is – how to put this? – an intergalactic shit. In the fantasy realms where he has the ability to colonise Mars, he’s going to take fellow intergalactic shits like Jeff up there, in a sort of tech-bro version of the Rapture, and the last thing the rest of humanity is going to see as he blasts off is the word PEDOS, spelled out in a nuclear-firework goodbye. So yes, I know I’m hardly breaking this to you, but we haven’t discovered a new breed of good guy. The new boss isn’t the same as the old boss he’s arguably much worse. And this isn’t philanthropy – it’s fauxlanthropy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dcff1377900bf6b672b9f8dc7ac8c572f45d10a/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f250f2d564aef371599ad6e868df7e8","title":"judges brexit vote eu referendum vote leave","story":"The Electoral Commission, charged by parliament with ensuring the 2016 EU referendum was fair, unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of leave. That’s the striking consequence of a high court decision from this morning.Late last year, the Good Law Project (GLP) – of which I am director – sued the Electoral Commission in the high court on two grounds. First, it challenged the adequacy of the commission’s investigation into spending by Vote Leave. And second, it said that the EC had got the law wrong around donations.Having initially said that both grounds were “without merit and not conceded in any respect”, the commission agreed to reopen its investigation into Vote Leave’s spending. It ultimately agreed with GLP that Vote Leave and Darren Grimes – founder of youth group BeLeave – had broken the law. Both have now been referred by the commission to the police.This morning’s high court judgment deals with the second strand of GLP’s case – that the commission got the law wrong in taking the view donations could not count as spending.Back in September last year, in a now deleted tweet, Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, admitted that the commission had given Vote Leave the “extremely surprising” ruling that it could donate surplus monies to other leave campaigners.And Vote Leave went on to do exactly that.Because Vote Leave was up against its spending limits, it couldn’t spend in its own name. But the commission ruling opened the door for it to donate £620,000 to Grimes to pay for advertising services he purchased from AggregateIQ – the same data analytics and online advertising firm Vote Leave had been using for similar services – and to donate £100,000 to Veterans for Britain (which was also spent with AIQ).Stronger In was also up against its spending limits. But because it didn’t get the advice from the commission, it had to stop spending. And this morning the high court decided that advice given to Vote Leave by the commission was wrong. The consequence is that the commission unlawfully tilted the playing field.What does all this mean?First, the commission – charged by statute with ensuring campaigners complied with the law – instead allowed Vote Leave to break it. The high court decision is absolutely excoriating: the commission was “unconstructive”, its actions lacked “any rational basis” and were “arbitrary”, and its approach to the law was a “recipe for abuse of the spending restrictions”. Heads must roll, beginning with that of Bob Posner, the commission’s legal counsel.Second, the inevitable consequence of the high court decision is that Vote Leave has broken the law in two different ways: once with “common plan spending” with Grimes – the matter already referred to the police, and where Vote Leave acted without commission sign-off – and once by following the commission’s unlawful and “extremely surprising” advice.And fourth, there may be profound implications for the Democratic Unionist party. A BBC investigation by Jim Fitzpatrick suggests that the Constitutional Research Council – which donated £435,000 to the DUP to spend on “Vote to Leave” ads in the  newspaper (which is not published in Northern Ireland) and on AIQ – also controlled how that donation was spent.If that is the case, a consequence of the high court’s decision will be that the council will have unlawfully incurred referendum expenses substantially in excess of the £10,000 limit, and so will have committed a criminal offence. The Good Law Project intends to write immediately to the EC inviting it to commence an investigation into the CRC – and threatening further judicial review proceedings if it will not.These are not the findings of a government agency. These are the conclusions of the high court – and an immensely powerful court at that. One of the judges was a court of appeal judge at the time of the hearing, and the other is a court of appeal judge now. They have concluded that the regulator mismanaged the referendum. And the consequence is that Vote Leave has broken the law.The government regulator in charge of ensuring the referendum was fair itself acted unlawfully and tilted the playing field in favour of leave. This isn’t democracy: it’s an embarrassment.• Jolyon Maugham QC is the director and founder of the Good Law Project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e322856cb1f17f9ce218c1148182795a69c8ce45/49_0_2414_1448/master/2414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14a455bb2d91cc08c6968faf74b7586a","title":"lies russia rt salisbury suspects putin","story":"The RT interview with the Sailsbury suspects was risible. But Putin’s attempt to dismantle the truth is deadly seriousComedy is now diplomacy by other means. A mighty nation has taken to conducting a grave international dispute by means of humour, expecting a similarly comic response in kind. How else are we to view the interview granted with RT, the state propaganda outfit formerly known as Russia Today, by the Morecambe and Wise of the east, the two men who identified themselves as Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov?Posing as Russian sports nutritionists, a professional fraternity whose record is not entirely unblemished, the\u0026nbspcomedy duo told the channel that they were indeed\u0026nbspthe men the UK authorities had identified as visiting Salisbury in March, but they hadn’t made the trip\u0026nbspto kill the former spy Sergei Skripal. On the contrary,\u0026nbspthey were there as wide-eyed tourists, lured by the prospect of seeing a cathedral “famous for its 123-metre spire”. Wasn’t it odd that they had visited Salisbury so briefly on the first of two consecutive day trips?\u0026nbspNot at all, the TV funnymen insisted: these strong sons of the Russian winter had had to abandon their first attempt to see the sights, deterred by the impassable Wiltshire slush.Titter ye not, as fellow TV comedian Frankie Howerd might have put it. But titter we have, as the Boshirov \u0026amp Petrov show has spawned a thousand parodies. Their purported explanation was laughable and we have duly laughed. But is it the right response?What is the best way to deal with these egregious assaults on truth by two of the world’s most powerful men, one an authoritarian autocrat, the other a would-be authoritarian autocrat?Laughing in their faces has great appeal. It avoids dignifying garbage with a serious reply and rightly pricks the bubble of grandiosity that envelops all dictators, both actual and aspiring. But it comes at a cost. Lost in all the spire gags, for example, is the fact that the two Russians are credibly accused of using chemical weapons on British soil – and that a woman, Dawn Sturgess, is dead from novichok poisoning.More to the point, and though it sounds po-faced, to laugh at the RT interview is to risk collusion with it. Putin surely knows this alibi of his is absurd and easily debunked, and yet he offers it anyway. Part of that is the usual Kremlin trick: the weaponisation of doubt, throwing up enough chaff to enable Russia’s defenders to say the picture is unclear, the truth is elusive and no one can ever really know for sure.But it’s also more brazen than that: offering up a risible explanation whose very implausibility confirms\u0026nbspthat Moscow simply doesn’t care. The humour is intended to humiliate Britain: we killed on your territory and now we are laughing at you. To which Downing Street’s unsmiling condemnation of Russia’s\u0026nbsp“lies and blatant fabrications” may well be the right reaction.In that spirit, perhaps the best way to reply to Putin and Trump is with a calm, methodical debunking of their falsehoods. In the Salisbury case, CCTV sightings of the two men have made that easy. This approach has the virtue of winning over the undecideds, including within international opinion, as they watch Moscow and London slug it out. There is also a moral dimension: lies should not be allowed to stand without rebuttal.But here too there are problems. Defeated on the first hundred facts, the most ardent defenders of the Kremlin narrative will simply move on to the next hundred: their ingenuity in explaining away hard evidence is a bottomless well. It also risks a descent into what my colleague and longtime Putin-watcher Luke Harding calls “Versionland”, in which there is no single truth grounded in fact but competing versions.At best, even if you regard debunking as a necessary exercise it is hardly sufficient. The media has a special responsibility here, and there are small, specific actions we should take. Denying a megaphone to the likes of Alex Jones – who claims, without evidence, that the Sandy Hook massacre of elementary school children was faked – is a welcome first step.But news organisations need to drop the assumption when covering either Trump’s White House or Putin’s Kremlin that they are dealing with actors who play by the accepted rules of fact and veracity. That means you can’t simply tweet out a headline saying “Trump: 3,000 did not die” without effectively spreading his lies for him. And it means you can’t give the 8.10am interview slot on Radio 4 to a man presented as a fellow journalist when that man is in fact a functionary of the Russian state. Still, we will have to go further.In a thoughtful new book, Denial: The Unspeakable Truth, Keith Kahn-Harris draws a useful distinction between traditional denialist movements – which sought to construct “towering edifices of pseudo-scientific evidence” to support their claims – and what he calls post-denialists, who are much more cavalier. Rather than make a detailed case like, say, the climate-change deniers of old, post-denialists simply assert.Putin on Salisbury and Trump on Puerto Rico are perfect examples of this new post-denialism, says Kahn-Harris. They are in the business of “asserting their power to shape reality according to their will”. Casting aside the niceties of facts and evidence, post-denialists are inching closer to saying what they really think: while an old-school Holocaust denier would say Auschwitz never happened, a post-denialist might say it did – and that it was good. On this reading, Putin is getting closer to saying: “Sure, we did Salisbury: what of it?” With Trump, it’s, “Puerto Rican lives matter to me less, because their skin is the wrong colour.”If this is what’s happening, it requires a different response. It means getting to the heart of the matter, tackling the underlying, if repugnant, belief rather than focusing on the facts, or gags, that lie on the surface. It means responding to Trump not with data, but with a moral argument for the equal worth of all human life – and to Putin with the moral case against chemical weapons.Perhaps that does not feel like the struggle for today. But it is fast becoming one of the urgent questions of our time: how do we defend the truth in a world of lies?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a6a625c7ad3c1b2cec95a0e29fa37b3e3b5aa08/0_318_4731_2837/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0480322e28b879213a25152d98d3f65b","title":"thanks to the victoria and albert dundee no longer butt of a nations jokes","story":"Even in our ritual besmirching and humiliation of Dundee, we treated the city unequally.

The health inequalities that have long existed in\u0026nbspparts of Glasgow have kept the UK’s film and documentary sector afloat these last 20 years or so and rescued us journalists and commentators with a steady supply of numbers and testimonies.Glasgow is a big, brassy city and its advocates are never slow and rarely quiet about proclaiming its virtues and bewailing its problems. Not Dundee. Instead, we turned this city into a national joke. When, some years ago, statistics were released detailing the extent of underage maternity rates in Dundee they provided gags for a generation of professional comedians and amateur clowns who had never visited this city.The statistics that described multi-deprivation in some parts of Dundee were added merely as an afterthought in grim stories about Glasgow. Yet while my city was reckoned to have initiatives, gly projects and international sporting events all wrapped up in “wur culture” to dislodge the negative headlines, we thought of Dundee as beyond redemption. But it was never like this, not even close.Perhaps we can trace the fight-back to rescue Dundee’s reputation to 1986 when the Discovery, the ship\u0026nbspthat carried Scott and Shackleton on their first, successful Antarctic expedition, returned to the city that built her. Yet still the jokes and the ignorance continued and proud Dundonians who were making a difference in other places, among new friends, bore the brunt of their wit with fortitude and good humour. This was the city that founded a newspaper empire of global renown and a comic-book industry that inspired generations of artists and illustrators. It was the city of the Tay bridges, for heaven’s sake, and a shipbuilding and maritime powerhouse. It was the home of a world-class textile industry that became so successful that jute, an Indian fabric, was associated only with it.Dundee gave us the Average White Band, the Associates, Michael Marra and the author AL Kennedy. It’s currently the centre of the games industry, the coolest and edgiest sector in the world. It continues to provide big men and women for newspapers and television, all of whom I bow to. It never really had anything to be ashamed of and much for which the rest of Scotland ought to have been proud long before the V\u0026ampA Museum of Design opened this weekend. I can’t even begin to figure out why we bullied this city and its citizens for having social problems that were evident to the same degree in many other cities across the UK.And I’m not saying either that the V\u0026ampA will somehow wave a wand over Dundee and make things better just yet, but dear God in heaven it will surely make a difference. When I visited Dundee last month to see the V\u0026ampA, I met several Dundonians from an assortment of backgrounds. None talked about money being better spent on hospitals and schools. Instead, there was a recognition that relatively little of the £80m raised to build it had come from the civic purse. There was pride in this building, too, laced with a measure of relief that it was something beautiful. One local artist told me that as the design of the V\u0026ampA first began to emerge a series of pictures in the Dundee Courier it took the city’s breath away.A sense of social outreach, of making this a living, breathing part of Dundee, is embedded in its curved, concrete walls. Its Japanese creator, Kengo Kuma, has talked of it becoming the city’s living room, but it is already more than that. Mike Galloway, Dundee’s director of city development, has helped drive the V\u0026ampA project since its inception. He told me that the companies and contractors chosen to develop the waterfront around the V\u0026ampA had to sign a pledge to employ local people and to pay them Scotland’s enhanced living wage.Even when he encountered resistance to this wage guarantee, he was able to prove that this carried long-term economic benefits and stability as well as increased productivity.When he talked about the inspiration of Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum, he cited what many forget: that this Basque city in northern Spain was also regarded as the country’s school dunce. The projected estimates for the Guggenheim were about 500,000 visitors a year very quickly, that became 1.5 million, many of them people who simply can’t stop returning every year. “An assessment of its economic impact found that the Guggenheim was a prominent factor in persuading companies to invest in the city often, it just tipped the scales in favour of Bilbao.”Within the walls of the V\u0026ampA Dundee, families will be encouraged to spend hours here and not feel pressure to spend money for the pleasure. They can bring their own food and fire up their electronic devices and simply linger here out of the rain or away from the troubles of life. The art and artefacts may inspire and soothe them but the building itself will probably already have done that.In the city beyond, there will still be unemployment and health inequality and low wages some schools will continue to encounter poverty of ambition and an absence of self-esteem. A celebration of design also salutes the power of imagination and creativity to solve problems and the willingness to embrace risk. This may yet prove to be the V\u0026ampA’s greatest gift to Dundee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24755184fe1077c4446c4b4f9ea2130","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

If we can put a camera down and pick out three new species within a matter of days ... these things are not rare – they are just out of reach.”With more than 300 known varieties of snailfish, Jamieson said it has adapted to a wide variety of conditions, some extremely tough to survive in.“Most of them live at shallow levels – we even get them up the Tyne river in Newcastle. They’re an amazing family that has sort of evolved to fit every niche, every corner of the planet,” he said.He nevertheless admitted to being impressed with the newly discovered varieties and their ability to thrive in some of the harshest environments on Earth.“The water temperatures in these trenches are always less than 2C – that in itself is pretty hardcore, let alone slamming 800-bar pressure on it and hardly any food,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ed84338f8c5cde3ebbeb1697c1006ff963e021/192_503_7876_4726/master/7876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce9fa4036a2a6df76c1b5109a66e6e7","title":"literary figures object to mobile phone mast wales","story":"Its monks left more than a century ago but the whitewashed stone walls of the monastery in Capel-y-ffin stand proud. Outside, a large, well-preserved statue of the Virgin Mary welcomes visitors to the venerable Victorian building, which has now been converted into self-catering apartments in great demand when the crowds flock to nearby Hay-on-Wye for its celebrated literary festival.Since the monks’ departure, little has changed in this picturesque Welsh hamlet of a few houses, a chapel and a scattering of farms. Nestling in the foothills of the Black Mountains, it is a place of moss and bracken, stone walls and brooks, and has the lingering solemnity of an untended churchyard.Part of the Brecon Beacons national park, Capel-y-ffin has long repelled development. Its one obvious nod to modernity is the local phone box. When installed half a century ago or so, it was painted a muted green, in keeping with park guidelines it is now a vivid red.But this sepulchral place, without a mobile phone connection and fast internet access, looks set to be dragged into the 21st century, to the dismay of many local people and a host of literary figures who have sought refuge in Capel-y-ffin.The Home Office and telecoms network EE want to build a 17.5-metre mobile phone mast with three antennas, two microwave dishes and a pole-mounted satellite dish just above the hamlet, next to a track that provides a gateway to the Black Mountains, with their extraordinary views across Wales and England.According to the planning application, the mast will have a “medium” impact on its environment, but the Brecon Beacons Park Society disagrees. In its letter to Lisa Williams, the authority’s planning officer, the society says: “Many people would find the contrast of the lines of the brutalist tower, with its attachments, cabinet, concrete base and mesh fenced compound, an extremely stark contrast with the natural flow of the landscape.”The novelist Ian McEwan is among the 60 people who have objected to the proposal, which goes before the Brecon Beacons national park planning authority next month. “I have hiked in this region for almost half a century,” he wrote. “Its unchanged nature is just one of its many attractions.”“There’s something special about this place,” says Erica Mary Griffiths, who was born in the monastery in the 1930s and runs a pony trekking centre in the area. “People who are a bit lost, not quite sure where to go, they tend to find their way up this valley, to this place of tranquillity.”Griffiths remembers how the telephone wires had to go underground rather than on poles when the hamlet got landlines, such were the stringent protections laid down by the park authority. She remembers, too, how the monastery took in refugees during the second world war. After the horrors of what they had fled, its solitude must have seemed a balm.It wasn’t just refugees who found solace in its isolation. Painters, poets and sculptors were inspired by time spent in the valley. And a veritable Who’s Who of 20th-century fiction has been touched by the place after spending time at Carney, a small stone cottage in danger of being overrun by rosehips and brambles, owned by the publisher Tom Maschler.Doris Lessing, Kurt Vonnegut, John Fowles, McEwan, Arnold Wesker and Edna O’Brien all stayed at the cottage, which is only 150 metres from the site of the proposed mast. It was in Carney that Bruce Chatwin wrote his novel On the Black Hill.The beat poet Allen Ginsberg was inspired to write Wales Visitation after staying at Carney. Photographs of Ginsberg, taken by Maschler, show him rolling around on the hills “smelling the brown vagina-moist ground”, as he enthused in his poem, lauding their remoteness from the connected world: “160 miles from London’s symmetrical thorned tower  \u0026amp network of TV pictures”.Alice Maschler, Tom’s daughter, has been instrumental in mobilising opposition. “When I heard about this proposal, I cried, and felt like I had lost someone I relied on, no matter what,” she said. “Carney and its surrounds is a sanctuary, where people come and touch a magical presence.”While many believe the mast will be an ugly intrusion, others fear the impact of its technology. In her letter of objection, Griffiths writes: “There are so many unanswered questions about these new mobile wireless phones, iPads and computers being introduced everywhere today.”Her views accord with those of a growing army of people who, like the refugees who once came to Capel-y-ffin, are fleeing something they fear. In online forums, “electromagnetic refugees” discuss the best places in the world to live away from microwave radiation, which they believe is making people ill. The movement is particularly vocal in Australia and pockets of the US.Others, however, see the mast – which initially will deliver a new emergency services network – very differently. One farmer who declined to give his name said: “I had a heart attack two years ago and luckily was near the landline. But if I’d been a couple of miles away, I’d have needed a mobile phone then. The people complaining only come here twice a year.”Amid the standoff, some locals seek a compromise – moving the mast to a less prominent position or substituting it for a different type that would be lower and less obtrusive. The planning authority’s own guidelines state: “Where developments would be visually prominent, evidence must be provided to show that alternative locations have been investigated and are impractical.” Some locals question whether such alternatives have been discussed.As they made their way up the valley last Thursday, walkers Rod and Angie Edwards stopped to drink in the view. Rod used to design wind farms for a living. “I’d go ballistic if someone wanted to put a windfarm here but a 17.5-metre mast isn’t so high,” he said. “We live on the edge of Snowdonia and our children couldn’t get a mobile signal when they were teenagers. We’ve got superfast broadband now and it makes all the difference.”But Griffiths, born and bred in the valley, believes the mast is too high a price to pay. “People find a lot of peace and quiet here,” she said. “There are not things going on like there are in other places.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76e9f3ef46f6099b05e55d4d68410dd97c9292d0/0_39_3604_2164/master/3604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0287f3c791969aa6437f620fb0c7590f","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A cuddly lion and a rescued baby gibbon are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":null,"title":"photographer martin parr i know nothing about fashion","story":"As one of Britain’s most celebrated photographers, Martin Parr is known for unvarnished portraits that never flatter their subjects. So why does the fashion pack love him?I don’t know why people like the pictures I take. It’s not my job to say. But I do know that over the last 18 months I have been working with fashion brands more than ever before, even though I am not a fashion photographer and I know nothing about fashion. That’s probably an advantage: I’m not copying whatever the latest trend might be. I just use my own language.When you work with a fashion brand, you are pursuing someone else’s agenda – that’s why you are paid, that’s how the system works. These products are generally very expensive, they are not the sort of thing I would buy, but I understand the rules of the game. You have to use your accumulated knowledge and try to make interesting pictures within the parameters, and give it some plausibility.My first fashion commissions came about 30 years ago, from a magazine called Amica. Over the years since then, I have usually done fashion in a very low-profile way. The most interesting projects are often those in which I can use an idea I’d had anyway. Recently, for example, I shot people going to Sainsbury’s in their dressing gowns for the British fashion magazine Chaos 69. A few years before I used another idea – about children going to the dentist – with their parents wearing fashion clothes, for Kid’s Wear magazine in Germany.Most recently, I’ve worked with Gucci. I shot a watch campaign, which launched on Instagram in July, in nine different places around the world, from Tokyo to Hong Kong to LA. I then shot their cruise lookbook in a series of hotels in Cannes. Christopher Simmonds, who art-directed the second shoot, came and had a discussion about a few books of mine and things like that – I was amazed by how well-versed he seemed to be on what I’ve done.Clothes can be revealing in photographs: anything ephemeral is interesting because you know how dated it will soon look – I like things that are of now and date badly. But on a personal note I am entirely indifferent to them. It takes me 20 seconds to choose what to wear I have a very boring wardrobe of checked short-sleeved shirts and chinos or jeans. I bought a designer jumper once, by Paul Smith, which I still get out occasionally. And Gucci gave me a suit, which was very nice. It’s blue, it’s about as sober as you can get. I wore it to dinner with them in Hong Kong. I’m waiting for the right occasion to wear it again.If I was going to a party or an opening, I would probably wear a shirt with Robert Mugabe or Barack Obama’s face on it. I collect ephemera associated with dictators, so the Mugabe shirt fits that I had the Obama shirts made up from fabric I bought in Mali. I’m still looking for a Mugabe jacket – I’ve been searching eBay for 20 years – but now that he’s gone, I suspect I’ll never get one.I would say there is sometimes a mischievous edge to my work. I wouldn’t necessarily describe it as satirical, although I am trying to illustrate contradictions. In terms of class, I’m pretty democratic, actually. I’ve covered every class in the UK and I treat them in the same way: I just show things as I find them. Some people immediately assume that I’m out there to take the piss. I don’t think it’s as simple as that, although that perception hasn’t really done me any harm.I have covered fashion shows quite often as a documentary photographer, over the past 20 years, and they suit me down to the ground. All the well-heeled people, who are, generally speaking, there to show off, are very photogenic and unselfconscious and keen to be photographed. What’s not to like?The atmosphere was completely different at the most recent shows I photographed, however. It won’t surprise anyone to hear that all the models were on their phones, locked into their own little worlds. Getting a decent picture of that is quite a challenge. It’s funny, because before smartphones were around, the models always seemed to have bananas in their hands, which they would be eating, and which seem to have sort of slipped away. Now they hold their phones instead. I wonder if they give them the same sustenance.I’ve been told that authenticity is highly prized in fashion at the moment, and asked whether that’s why so many fashion types like my work. Well, that’s news to me. I don’t go round analysing things like that – it’s not what I’m interested in at all. I just do the pictures.

Indeed, it’s not insignificant that the film is the first Hollywood studio movie to feature a majority Asian cast since The Joy Luck Club in 1993. Yet to evaluate it solely on the basis of representation\u0026nbspis to do it a disservice and to further narrow the parameters of how we’re allowed to talk about movies that feature “erse” actors.Chu’s film is somewhere between My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a Jane Austen novel: meticulous and hilariously alert to social structures, family dynamics and money, with a plucky underdog heroine. Rachel Chu (Fresh Off the Boat’s Constance Wu) is, by her own admission, “so Chinese I’m an economics teacher with lactose intolerance”. A game theory specialist raised in New York by a single mother, she agrees to take a trip to Singapore with her boyfriend Nick Young (an extremely dashing Henry Golding) to attend a wedding and meet his family. Nick’s mother, the elegant, sneering matriarch Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), does not approve, for her son, as the title indicates, is crazy rich, creating an opportunity for Chu to explore new money versus old.As far as pure romcom spectacle is concerned, it’s a sugary delight a Chinese-language cover of Coldplay’s Yellow is gooey perfection. Golding has a real leading man quality and, crucially, nails the brooding smoulder. The writing is also very funny, particularly regarding Eleanor’s decidedly un-American cultural expectations. “Your room is ready … for you,” she tells her adult son.Still, this romcom fan had her reservations. Yes, the clue’s in the name, but the film embraces the idea of capitalism as inherently romantic, indulging in sweeping, swooning, tourist board-approved vistas of Singapore’s most luxurious\u0026nbspdestinations. Like the Fifty\u0026nbspShades of Grey movies, there’s so much glittering surface that it feels like the dazzle might be a distraction by design."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/122f4e1c7db8a7012633a8191382aee2d832fadb/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83693c280e8d10ebed13c6b374a80cbc","title":"tamal rays recipe pear eclairs","story":"Make the most of the first autumn pears with a super-light choux pastry treatI used to be mad about eclairs as a child. I must have got through my own body weight in them, but it wasn’t until many years later that I realised they came in versions other than the standard chocolate and whipped cream.Choux pastry can be daunting if you’ve never made it before, but follow the steps below and you should be fine. There will be enough here for a few extra shells, just in case a few go wrong in the oven.The trickiest bit in this recipe is getting the choux pastry right: the paste needs to be loose enough to pipe easily, but firm enough to hold its shape – a bit thicker than toothpaste. This isn’t a quick recipe, so you’ll probably want to set aside the afternoon. They’re worth the effort, though, and once you know how to make choux, you can go and experiment with all sorts of fillings and toppings.For the choux pastry75g salted butter60ml whole milk90ml water1 pinch table salt100g plain flour4 large eggs, 2 of them separatedFor the pear jam2 conference pears, peeled and grated (about 260g) – save 1 tbsp of juice in a separate bowl for the icing70g caster sugar70g light brown sugarJuice of 1 lemon1½ tbsp apple pectin40g dark rumFor the custard135g whole milk135g double cream20g cornflour2 large egg yolks(left over from the choux pastry mix)60g caster sugar60g light brown sugarFor the icing3 tsp lemon juice1 tbsp pear juice1 tbsp rum200g fondant icing sugarGreen food colouring (optional)Cocoa powder (optional)Start with the hardest part: the choux pastry. Add the butter, milk, water and salt to a medium saucepan over a medium heat and bring to a boil. Add the flour, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mix forms into a ball of dough. Now for the work! Set a timer and continue to stir for four minutes. This bit is really important, so don’t be tempted to skip this step. As you stir, it will gradually lose water, which will billow off as steam. Take the choux paste off the heat and tip into a mixing bowl to cool. There will often be a thin layer of paste stuck to the base of the saucepan. This is normal (though a bit of a pain to clean off) don’t try to scrape it into the dough.Beat two eggs with a fork, then separate the yolks and whites of two more eggs and set both aside. Gradually add the beaten whole eggs to the dough a little at a time, and fully mix in before adding more. You’re aiming for a cohesive paste with no lumps that’s easily pipeable but also holds it shape – something slightly thicker than toothpaste. I find that the amount of egg required can wildly vary whenever I make this. If you still haven’t got to a loose enough mixture after using both the eggs then add some of the egg white from the separated eggs.Heat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7. Pop the paste into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm nozzle and pipe straight lines of the choux on to a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper. Dip your finger into some water, and use it to dab down the point of choux that will have formed at the end of each piped line. Bake the choux for 15 minutes, then take out of the oven, poke a hole in each choux case to allow the steam to escape, and return to the oven for two minutes more to dry out. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.While the choux is baking, make the jam. Put all the ingredients in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to a boil and heat for a few minutes until the water has boiled off– 104C on a thermometer. You can also test it by dropping a small amount of the mix on to a plate that has been chilling in the freezer - the surface should wrinkle slightly when prodded.For the custard, add all the ingredients to a saucepan over a medium heat. Stir constantly and cook until the mixture thickens. Set aside to cool.Gently fold together the custard and jam so that you can still see distinct pockets of each in the mix. Pop it, in another piping bag, snip off the end and fill each eclair through the hole you made to release the steam.Make the icing: mix the juices, rum, icing sugar and food colouring (if using), You can use a piping bag fitted with a flat head nozzle to pipe the icing on to the eclair. Or, for a more rustic finish, use a palette knife to spread it over the eclairs.

It was Liverpool’s fifth straight win, only the third time they have started the season so immaculately, and perhaps the most frightening thought for the teams playing catch-up is that Mohamed Salah has still not quite found his most exhilarating form of last season.Not that Salah was too shabby during those long spells when Liverpool overwhelmed their opponents and repeatedly opened up what is supposed to be one of the better defences in the top ision. Once again, the front line of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané shimmered with menace. Yet there is also growing evidence that Liverpool can no longer be considered a lopsided team. The partnership between Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk is flourishing and until the five minutes of stoppage time, when the substitute Erik Lamela scored for Spurs, it was difficult to think of another period when Alisson, the away team’s goalkeeper, was in sustained danger.It was certainly unusual to see Spurs being outplayed this way and a particular ordeal for Michel Vorm, deputising for the injured Hugo Lloris in goal. Vorm’s frailties were exposed for both of Liverpool’s goals, scored by Georginio Wijnaldum and Firmino, and his mind seemed scrambled during parts of the second half. If anything, it was a surprise Liverpool restricted themselves to no more goals, the only criticisms being that their final pass was often lacking and their finishing not clinical enough. The final score hardly does justice to the gulf that existed between the sides. “The performance was better than the result,” was Jürgen Klopp’s take. “This was by far the best performance of the season.”For Spurs, it was the first time since the closing stages of the 2015-16 season that they have lost successive fixtures in the top ision. Lloris may have disgraced himself recently off the pitch but, if Vorm continues being this vulnerable, Spurs will long for their first-choice goalkeeper to return. Harry Kane’s performance did little to shift the perception that he needs a break and Mauricio Pochettino could not possibly argue it was deserved when Lamela, a substitute, caught out Alisson with a low, angled shot in the third minute of added time.Almost inconceivably, Spurs could have salvaged a draw, with Mané lucky not to concede a penalty in the final seconds for tripping Son Heung-min, another substitute. Spurs were entitled to grumble because it was a clear foul. A draw, however, would have been a travesty. “This type of game shows we need to improve – a lot – if we want to be a contender,” Pochettino said.Klopp talked about Liverpool having “85 brilliant minutes” and Pochettino must be acutely aware his team could have lost far more heavily. Klopp could also reflect on the incident, inside the opening 40 seconds, when Firmino turned James Milner’s cross into the far corner only for the goal to be disallowed, harshly, for an offside decision against Mané, who did not get a touch but was deemed to have been interfering with play.When Liverpool did take the lead, in the 39th minute, Klopp could have been forgiven for thinking it was overdue. Pochettino, in turn, must have been alarmed by how often his players were making life difficult for themselves and even Christian Eriksen, such an elegant mover of the ball, will have to take some culpability bearing in mind it was his carelessness that gave away possession close to the penalty area and led to the corner.All the same, Vorm should have done much better when Milner swung the corner into the six-yard area. Did Milner deliberately aim it so close to the goalkeeper? It felt that way and Vorm’s attempted punch succeeded only in flicking the ball towards the back post. Eric Dier could not get enough distance with his defensive header. Wijnaldum looped his header over Kieran Trippier and when Vorm clawed it away the goalkeeper was a foot behind the line.In fairness to Vorm, he did spare his team, at 0-0, when Dier got a backward pass horribly wrong and left Salah with a run on goal.That period of the game was also notable for Jan Vertonghen trying to chip Alisson from just inside the Liverpool half. It was nowhere near coming off and felt strangely symbolic of his team’s dishevelled performance.Liverpool, in stark contrast, looked full of confidence, chasing down their opponents and encouraged by the sheer number of times that Spurs gave up the ball inside their own half. Mané set up the second goal with a surging run on the left. Vertonghen’s attempt to cut out the cross succeeded only in turning the ball against the post and Vorm was on the floor as the rebound rolled his way. He could not adjust in time, the ball squeezed through his hands and Firmino had a simple finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668d2da44dfe0500cf14d799b19642d9d865dfaa/0_130_3399_2040/master/3399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0142202ac15e9d7a4f3d47d09d289172","title":"newcastle v arsenal manchester city v fulham clockwatch live","story":"League One: Portsmouth look set to leapfrog Peterborough United and go top of League One after doubling their lead at the ABAX Stadium.

Thanks for joining me, bye for now.Here’s Jürgen Klopp: “We were the deserved winner of that game today. They could have scored a second goal at the end but for 85 minutes, we were dominant.”“Coming back from abroad, having one training session and sticking to our plan so well, I was really impressed. We had to be compact in midfield, because Spurs are strong playing between the lines.”“It’s unbelievably difficult – after an international break, playing Tottenham at 12.30pm. Tough game, two very good teams, good to watch – we could have decided it earlier, but I’m fine with the result.”It’s actually Pochettino up first, and he’s a little spikier than usual, suggesting Spurs should have had a late penalty.“They were the better team. We competed, we were close – and it should have been a penalty at the end, Mané on Son. We were so far away, not in terms of the result, but the performance. We need to be more consistent. I am not worried, I promise you – we need to win, we need to work. We will try and find a solution.”He then gets a little irritated by suggestions this is his toughest time as Spurs manager. “Don’t worry about me, I’m good,” he says in reply.Hoping to get a few words from Jürgen Klopp after the latest slew of betting ads. The big man should be in good form after winning at Wembley for the first time. After that, don’t forget to join Barry Glendenning for the clockwatch:I’ll be back later on for Watford v Manchester United, which should be half-decent. This is a nice insight on Javi Gracia’s methods from Simon Burnton:The next month will continue to test Liverpool’s growing title credentials. They host PSG and Southampton in the next week, then Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, before a brutal eight days as we head into October – Chelsea (A), Napoli (A), Manchester City (H). If they still have a perfect league record after that, they’ll be favourites.Spurs won’t play at Wembley again until 3 October, when they face Barcelona – these are their fixtures before then:Lamela’s goal and that late penalty shout disguised what was a bad day for Spurs. They never had a coherent plan, and could have had few complaints if they had lost by four or five goals. As for Liverpool, Klopp will rightly be annoyed by their wastefulness in front of goal, but they were the better team from the first minute, and passed their first big test of their title ambitions in impressive fashion.It’s faintly absurd that Liverpool only won by one goal, but win they did, and deservedly so. They’re top of the table, with five wins from five.95 mins: Rose launches it into the box, and it rebounds to Son, who should probably hit it first time, but tries to open up a better angle in the area. Mané makes contact with his heel and Son goes over – he looked slightly off-balance, and doesn’t appeal. Replays suggest Mané might have got away with one, but it’s a difficult call for the referee to make. VAR, anyone?94 mins: Eriksen’s delivery from deep is cleared. Spurs will have one more chance from a long throw...94 mins: Van Dijk concedes a clumsy foul, and Spurs have a free kick. How on earth have Liverpool not closed this game out?!And from it, Spurs get within a goal! Lamela chests the cross down at the far post, and lashes the ball into the opposite corner!92 mins: Two of the five added minutes played, and Spurs force a corner, Rose’s shot deflected behind...90 mins: Mané fires high and wide with Wijnaldum in support. Wijnaldum and Milner have been terrific in midfield – they’ve been everywhere.89 mins: This game is drifting to a close as the Liverpool fans entertain themselves in the away end. Joel Matip is on for Alexander-Arnold, with Gomez shifting to right back.There’s a choice crop of 3pm fixtures this afternoon – Newcastle v Arsenal and Manchester City v Fulham among them. Join Barry Glendenning for the clockwatch straight after this:“Just a quick one to say credit to Liverpool,” says Alistair Donegan. “Poch got formation and personnel all wrong - three slow centre mids and no Son - and Liverpool have destroyed us. Expect it to be 3-0 by the time I press send.”On the bright side, it’s still only 2-0. 85 mins: And here’s why – Lamela gets a yard of space 12 yards out, and is inches from cutting the deficit in half! Liverpool have had 12 shots on target Spurs have had one.84 mins: Salah is eager to get on the scoresheet and tries the same trick again, with Sturridge in space. Klopp is furious with him.83 mins: Salah slaloms through the Spurs defence but can’t get any power on his shot...82 mins: Two more changes – Wanyama, back from a knee injury, is on for Eric Dier. For Liverpool, Daniel Sturridge replaces Keita.80 mins: Vorm saves well from Salah, who cuts onto his left foot as Liverpool walk through the Spurs midfield again. Moments later, Mané fires a weak shot at Vorm.“Harry Kane looks completely out of sorts, like he’s carrying an injury,” says Kari Tulinius. “When he’s fit he can be relied on to convert half-chances and get himself in dangerous positions – but on current form he’s nearly a passenger.”It was noticeable from that Eriksen cross – it wasn’t straightforward, but Kane at his sharpest would be burying that.76 mins: Those stoppages have taken what edge there was out of the game. Now Dier is down and getting treatment.As tweeted to me by Tony Cowards (possibly not his real name), Alderweireld’s shirt doesn’t have a Spurs badge on it. Anyone know why? 70 mins: Klopp isn’t happy on the touchline – Henderson was about to come on for Keita, but Firmino is down after being poked in the eye by Vertonghen. It seems he’s been told he can’t change the substitution – although eventually, Henderson does come on for Firmino. For Spurs, Son is on in place of Harry Winks.68 mins: Lamela looks to set Lucas free with a long free kick, but the Brazilian is offside. He is looking like Spurs’ biggest threat, dropping into that space between Gomez and Alexander-Arnold.66 mins: Chance! Kane has struggled to get involved, but has a sniff here as Eriksen lashes a cross-shot across goal. It’s behind him and he swings a heel at it, but doesn’t get enough contact.65 mins: Lucas tries a slide-rule pass to Trippier, but he’s 20 yards away.63 mins: Liverpool break upfield, three on two, Mané strolling forward with Salah and Keita in tow. He opts to play in the latter, and Vorm tips his shot over the bar. He should have scored, and this could get embarrassing for Spurs.62 mins: Gary Neville is absolutely roasting Joe Gomez for a minor, inconsequential lapse of concentration.61 mins: A Liverpool free-kick leads to a goalmouth melee, but Vorm manages to reel the ball in under pressure.60 mins: Dembele is coming off, replaced by Erik Lamela. As it stands, Tottenham’s midfield consists of Harry Winks, but I assume they’ll reorganise.56 mins: It’s looking very much like five league wins from five for Liverpool. So – is this Their Year?Liverpool build up slowly before Robertson finds Mané down the left. He tears past Trippier and fires in a low cross that’s turned onto the post by Vertonghen. Vorm flaps clumsily at the rebound, allowing Firmino to tap in from about an inch out.Liverpool double their lead, Vorm not covering himself in glory again as Firmino toe-pokes home!50 mins: Spurs hit the post! Lucas looks isolated near the left-hand touchline but bustles past Gomez, finds space suddenly opening up, and pings a shot off the near post! That would have been very much against the run of play.49 mins: Vorm rescues Spurs here though, saving well from Mané after Salah had eased Dembele off the ball! A lively start to this second half...48 mins: Almost a second weird goal for Liverpool, as Robertson’s mishit cross pings off the bar. Vorm was nowhere near it.47 mins: Gomez nearly lets Lucas in from nowhere, but he can’t sort his feet out as Van Dijk sprints back, and the ball bobbles through to Alisson.46 mins: Dier has dropped into the back three, on the right hand side.The second half is go. No changes at half-time for either team.Surely Spurs have to get Son Heung-min on, sooner rather than later?Take your pick:Giorginio Wijnaldum’s first away goal in the Premier League gives Liverpool a deserved half-time lead. More soon.45 mins: One added minute. Vorm has to race off his line to clear Keita’s through ball to Mané, who was in acres.44 mins: Spurs haven’t really tested Alisson, but have also left space in behind. Not ideal, and if Liverpool had been more clinical, they would be two or three behind.42 mins: Milner kickstarts another dangerous Liverpool break, playing Wijnaldum in down the right. He has Firmino in support but delays his decision, then shoots weakly across goal.41 mins: That’s the fifth goal Spurs have conceded in the league, and all of them have been headers.Milner swings in the corner, and Vorm makes an awful hash of the punch, spilling it across goal. Dier heads clear, but Wijnaldum heads it back on target. Vorm paws it away, but the ball was a foot over the line!Liverpool lead from a corner, and Michel Vorm has to carry the can for this one.36 mins: Now Spurs have a chance to break – both teams seem determined to play on the counter – and Vertonghen has Kane and Lucas ahead of him. Instead he tries to lob Alisson from 40 yards. Do I not like that, Pochettino says with his eyes.34 mins: Keita intercepts in midfield and Mané can run at the back four – but he stumbles and can only scuff a shot that Vorm saves easily.32 mins: Keita bursts into space down the left but his cut-back is intercepted. Both sides are struggling to find the killer pass here.30 mins: Spurs are more threatening now, Eriksen getting in behind on the right and trying to pick out Lucas in the middle. Liverpool clear for a corner which Van Dijk thunks away.28 mins: Eriksen lines it up but opts to swing the free kick towards the far corner, where Alisson collects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9885be5398f4aa0270d132126b30af1237354deb/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da2e3258af98e7f2f2db315c6fbd0ccc","title":"blind date amber ellie","story":"What were you hoping for?My future life partner and co-parent to our children.

There’s no fault there. I just wish it hadn’t startedI don’t think there’s malice. I mean, it would be wrong for me to hold on to it if there were.

How I had cancer a few years ago, and how we tried and failed to have children and lost pregnancies through IVF. I wonder if we maybe looked like a sad couple who needed saving, or people so desperate we couldn’t contain ourselves?As it turned out, you’d apparently wanted to be a surrogate since you were little, had loved more than anything the experience of your own pregnancy, but didn’t want more children, so this was, well, ideal.I think what stings the most is not that you couldn’t do it in the end, but that you sought us out, telling us you really wanted this, for you, for us. Did you just like the sound of your own voice saying you were going to be a surrogate? Had you not thought through any, all, of the details at this point?On finding out about you through a mutual connection, and sharing the news with my husband, I felt a palpable sense of joy from him. One I hadn’t seen in a long, long time. I think he’d given up hope, and given up wanting hope, because it was too painful to be let down. The three of us had positive and exciting conversations. We arranged to meet, the date was on. Just you and me, because that was easier – let’s not make it too massive at this point, was the thought. Only it was, already, from the minute you appeared: how could we not think this ridiculous option might be our chance?

You won’t have the same problem with an audiobook. You may even find yourself so enthralled that you run an extra mile without noticing Last year, when Peter Johnston turned 50, he had a life crisis. The Stockport native had a successful career as an IT consultant, a loving wife, two young daughters, and plenty of friends to go to the pub with most evenings. But on his 50th birthday, as he went into his bathroom to shave, he remembers not liking what he saw in the mirror.“I was evidently overweight, pale skin, bumps all over my face – you name it. I didn’t look good at all.” He admits that it’s probably a phase that most men his age tend to go through, a “realisation that you’re now definitely old, and that it’s going to be more difficult to keep up in the same way I used to be able to”. Which scared him, especially because he wanted to be healthy enough to play with his daughters and be a good dad for them as they grow up. He decided to take up jogging, with the aim of running his first half-marathon before his 51st birthday. He bought new running shoes and gym clothes, and his wife helped him set up a music playlist on his phone. He was all set to go, but he found his runs difficult.Not because he wasn’t able to endure them, but rather, that listening to music was not right for him. “After a while, I’d get bored – especially when you’re listening to the same tracks again. Don’t get me wrong, I love ACDC, but there are only so many times I can listen to Shoot to Thrill. Or, when you aren’t feeling a track but you can’t change it without interrupting your run,” he says. “Worse,” he adds, “when you’re in a busier area, like a high street, and you want to change the song, you have to keep jogging, while playing with your phone and making sure you don’t run into anyone. It’s a nightmare.” A work friend recommended that Johnston change his tune not to other forms of music, but, rather, to audiobooks – full-length books told through high-quality audio narrations, and presented in formats similar to podcasts. The medium has grown rapidly over the past five years, particularly on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones – and Audible now provides the world’s largest selection of audiobooks. According to the UK’s Publishers’ Association, around one in 10 Brits are now listening to audiobooks, while spending on the medium has more than doubled in the past five years to a total of £31m. Research commissioned by Audible from University College London earlier this year showed that audiobooks produced a stronger emotional and physiological response compared with visual storytelling mediums such as TV and video streaming, regardless of the genre of content being listened to. For Johnston, listening to audiobooks has multiple benefits. For starters, he says: “I’m actually reading a lot more.” He started off with Yuval Noah Hari’s Sapiens: A History of Humankind, which Johnston described as one of the “most thought provoking listens” of his life. “When you’re running, and listening to what’s basically the origin of human thought, why we do what we do, it’s pretty amazing,” he says. “I was listening to it while running through the countryside one weekend, and I was so engrossed in it, thinking about what was being said, and how that shaped the world around me I’d forgotten about my distance completely. I’d run a mile longer without even realising.” And it’s not just while running that he’s found audiobooks useful. Like millions around the world, he also listens to audiobooks when doing general day-to-day activities such as driving, doing household chores, and even when he’s relaxing in the bath. His favourites tend to be non-fiction titles, with one recently being Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which he stumbled on while browsing recommended titles on Audible. “It’s such a fascinating book,” says Johnston. “And it’s told in a really interesting and engaging way that’s humorous, but also really exciting. I wasn’t really that good at science in school, but I learned more about quantum physics from listening to that book while doing the laundry the other week than I did in four years of studying it at school.” Johnston will turn 51 in October. Since his birthday, he’s 12kg lighter, leaner, and says he feels “better than I’ve ever done in my life”. And that’s not just in his physical fitness, but, thanks to audiobooks, mentally too. “I’ve been able to discover all these things that I otherwise wouldn’t have the time to go out looking for,” he says. “I can browse through the library on my phone, or just type in a subject I find interesting one day and voila – I’ll find loads of books I can listen to at the tips of my fingers.”“Audiobooks aren’t just a way of keeping me entertained while I run miles,” says Johnston. “They’ve given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.”Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5751f6f7b7ecd2ba3270482a83a0b8ffa12e52ee/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eb846ee51df60643226b1156fc7ee7","title":"ex cbi chief paul drechsler lambasts eu leaders and uk over citizens rights","story":"Paul Drechsler says politicians should be ashamed citizens’ rights in UK and Europe have not been guaranteedThe former president of the Confederation of British Industry has said European leaders including Theresa May should be ashamed that they have not guaranteed the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals in Europe in the event of no deal on Brexit.Paul Drechsler said leaving more than 5 million people in limbo went against basic British and European values.“It’s an absolute scandal, two-and-a-half years in, that citizens of Europe in the UK and UK citizens in Europe still do not have an unambiguous, unconditional guarantee they will be OK no matter what.“We should be ashamed of the fact that we sweep that aside,” he said, of all involved in the Brexit negotiations.“Leaving people hanging by a thread of uncertainty is totally against British values, totally against European values,” he said.Mr Drechsler also said it was time to bury the “lies” about immigration and to tell people it was Britain’s lack of controls – not Europe’s – that led to the influx of people from Poland and other east European states after 2004.He also backed Theresa May’s Chequers proposal but called on the prime minister and EU leaders to drop their red lines and make a bold step to secure a deal. “Red lines are the enemy of a good deal for both parties,” he said. “History tells us when great political leaders put their minds to it, they can achieve extraordinary things.”Drechsler said the future of EU citizens in Britain was the most important issue for businesses in London as they would be able to adapt to whatever Brexit deal is done – but would not survive without EU workers of all skills.Drechsler is now chairman of London First, the umbrella business group for the capital, which has called on the government to introduce a six-year visa to allow for the continued flow of workers “at minimum or above minimum wage”.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, recently pledged that EU citizens would not be removed from the country if there was no Brexit deal, but he did not say what employment and social rights they would retain including the right to bring in non-EU family members.Drechsler said he believed Raab’s promise was genuine but said it behoved EU leaders to go much further.“For too long we have used EU citizens and British citizens in Europe have been used as a negotiating chip. All leaders should be ashamed that two-and-a-half years on this is still going on,” he said.“This is one of the great lies that people came in because of the lack of controls. Two-thirds who have come in the last 12 months did not come from the EU. It’s time we were honest with people about the positive role and contribution, our industry, research, tech, they make.“The UK has totally failed to manage people into this country for ever. Every other country in Europe does, they register them on arrival, they have a process of controlling their way to get benefits. What do we do? We leave the doors open, we don’t even track people coming in and out.”Drechsler said the business community backed Chequers, but said a deal could only be struck if that proposal was modified and both May and the EU dropped their red lines.He rejected calls from Brexiter MPs, including ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, to pursue a Canada “plus plus” deal saying the deal was about getting two trading entities thousands of miles apart closer together whereas Brexit was a separation of two entities that had been aligned for 40 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82cf77037533cef7f8eb08505856d1c85a8eb42e/0_522_7320_4391/master/7320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8edeb7e05d70785b0164685a3b5270","title":"labour figures slam claim that michael foot was paid by soviets","story":"Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock and John McDonnell condemn re-emergence of claim eight years after ex-Labour leader’s deathSenior Labour figures and the family of former party leader Michael Foot have reacted with anger over the re-emergence of the explosive claim that he was a paid Soviet informant.Neil Kinnock, who succeeded Foot as Labour leader, said his predecessor had been a “passionate and continual critic of the Soviet Union” in response to the allegation that MI6 believed Foot had been a paid informant.Labour’s current leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and Foot’s descendants were among those to condemn the publication of the claims eight years after his death. Foot successfully sued the Sunday Times when it published similar allegations 23 years ago.The story comes as Britain’s relationship with Moscow are yet again at a low ebb after two Russian nationals were charged over the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The pair have since said they were in the city to visit its cathedral.The original allegations about Foot date back to the claims of Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky, who alleged that the former Labour leader had received clandestine payments from the KGB and had been classed by the organisation as an “agent” and “confidential contact”.The fresh claim appears in a new book, The Spy and the Traitor, by the Times writer Ben Macintyre and also featured on the newspaper’s front page on Saturday.Kinnock said Foot had always been an opponent of the Soviet Union’s “internal and external despotism”.“He would never have served their purposes,” he said. “When these allegations were made against him in 1995 he sued the Sunday Times and won substantial damages. He has been dead for eight years. Repeating such claims without any substantive additional proof is filthy.”McDonnell told the Observer: “Michael Foot was a good and honest socialist whose only desire was to serve our country. Elements of the British media are sinking to new lows in debasing standards of journalism in this country. They used to be called the gutter press. Now they inhabit the sewers.”Corbyn tweeted on Saturday: John Foot, a great nephew of the former Labour leader, tweeted: “My great-uncle Michael Foot was a lifelong anti-Stalinist. Friend of Orwell ... Ludicrous to claim he was a Soviet spy. Sued successfully for libel around this when he was alive. No evidence. Shameful and cowardly.”Chris Mullin, the former Labour minister who worked with Foot, said he believed the claim was “cowardly ... given that Michael Foot is in no position to answer back”, adding: “He was a good, honourable man and a democrat to his fingertips.”Macintyre’s new book states that MI6 agents had been told about Gordievsky’s claims in the summer of 1982. It also says they concluded that Foot had not been a “spy or conscious agent”, but had been used for “disinformation purposes” and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money.It says that they were prepared to warn the queen, should Labour have won the election in 1983. “Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election,” it states. “It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the queen would have to be informed.”The Times’ coverage of the story suggests that had the new revelations been known at the time that the allegations first emerged, “it is unlikely Foot would have resorted to the libel courts”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f4c3889f57a0c7f098ca17be6ef1173a11ac57/0_0_2585_1551/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02bdbb2a419b40b7609d5b1398462667","title":"birmingham beyond the blade podcast","story":"In our second episode, we travel to Birmingham and hear from a group of parents about the role of fear in driving incidents of violent crime.

Our main thing is effort in our team, we’ve let ourselves down in the last couple of games. I think we showed a little bit of what we can do tonight. We should be proud of ourselves but plenty more work to do.”Few had given the Springboks any chance of winning the game, having lost their last two matches and seemingly dropped below the standard that drove them to a 2-1 series win over England in June.Mindful the All Blacks have scored 38 or more in each of their Rugby Championship games this season, they knew they would need to score more than 30 themselves to have a chance.The Springboks started poorly, going 12-0 down inside the first 20 minutes as Jordie Barrett and Smith were put over as the All Blacks showcased their superb ability to offload under pressure.The problem with wanting to do everything at speed, however, resulted in poor decision making with the Springboks pouncing on errors deep inside All Blacks territory to score three unanswered tries within 11 minutes to earn a 21-12 lead.From then on, the All Blacks were chasing the game and while they struck back with Ioane’s first try, the Springboks went into half-time with a 24-17 lead following Handre Pollard’s only penalty.Replacement winger Kolbe intercepted a pass from Anton Lienert-Brown to give the Springboks a 14-point lead two minutes into the second half, which proved to be the advantage they needed as the All Blacks came storming back.Taylor and Savea crossed from lineout drives to set up a nail-biting finish that ended when Damian McKenzie lost the ball in a tackle.“You’ve got to give them all the credit in the world the way they defended in that second half,” All Blacks captain Kieran Read said.“We threw everything at them, my boys kept working hard but the South Africans defended outstandingly well and obviously deserved their win. They put us under pressure and we didn’t respond the way we needed.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115413646ca37c04ef5b8638884408fd3e44a305/0_131_3065_1839/master/3065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a65739f9a5df32f9261b2947e9bb37a","title":"lewis hamilton singapore f1 gp pole","story":"Lewis Hamilton took pole for Mercedes with a consummate lap under the lights of the Marina Bay circuit. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was in second place with the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel in third. Hamilton took the pole with a time that smashed the track record by more than three seconds.Hamilton was quickest on the first hot laps in Q3, threading the needle in Singapore with extraordinary skill in a time of 1min 36.015sec. His middle sector was particularly strong, taking every possible inch of track to the very limit with the walls looming over his car. Vettel could not match that run and was a huge sixth-tenths back, behind Verstappen in second, three-tenths down.Ferrari had been strong all weekend but they had no answer when it mattered. Hamilton could not improve on his second run in Q3 but nor could his competitors. He had done enough on a lap he described as magic and secured what had looked like an unlikely pole and once again put all the pressure on Ferrari to comeback at him.Valtteri Bottas was in fourth with Kimi Räikkönen in fifth and the second Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo in sixth.Hamilton’s seventh pole of the season is his fourth in Singapore but only the second time he has claimed the top spot here during the turbo-hybrid era. He has three wins at the Marina Bay circuit and if he can convert pole to victory, he will match Vettel as the most successful driver at the Singapore Grand Prix.It is his 79th career pole, scored against the odds and may prove crucial. He leads Vettel by 30 points in the world championship and will have been hoping to minimise the advantage Ferrari were expected to have on a track that does not play to the strengths of the Mercedes.The twisting challenge of the 23 slow-to-medium-speed corners is not what their car has been optimised for and in practice they appeared to be on the back foot. Ferrari were quickest in two of the three practice sessions, with Vettel heading a one-two in the final run on Saturday morning, half a second clear of the Briton in third. However, Hamilton found another level during qualifying to pull a remarkable result out of the bag. Vettel, in contrast, was left wondering why he was so far from his rival on track.Hamilton took an unlikely win here last year, when Vettel was eliminated after a crash into turn one. However, the pace and balance the Ferrari has shown it will remain a formidable competitor in race pace. The Scuderia’s car is particularly strong out of slow corners, Hamilton will be looking to hold his lead into turn one but will then face a sustained attack in what is a gruelling meeting with temperatures up to 50C and high humidity.Hamilton had played down the team’s chances, knowing the track has not suited the Mercedes in the past. But the team were confident they had found a setup for their car that was working well here and the technical director, James Allison, is confident they had good long-run pace for Sunday. If Hamilton can come away with a win, he will have made another big step towards his fifth title.The Force Indias of Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon were in seventh and ninth respectively. The Haas of Romain Grosjean was in eighth with Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg in tenth.Räikkönen topped the time sheets in Q2, with Vettel in sixth after he encountered traffic on his hot lap.

Moeen, who is a Muslim, made the allegation in his autobiography, which is being serialised in The Times newspaper, saying the apparent reference to Islamist militant Osama bin Laden came during his Ashes debut in Cardiff.“It was a great first Ashes Test in terms of my personal performance,” said Moeen, who scored 77 and took five wickets in what was his first Ashes match. “However there was one incident which had distracted me. An Australian player had turned to me on the field and said, ‘Take that, Osama’.“I could not believe what I had heard. I remember going really red. I have never been so angry on a cricket field.”In reaction to the allegation, a Cricket Australia Spokesperson said: “Remarks of this nature are unacceptable and have no place in our sport, or in society.“We have a clear set of values and behaviours that comes with representing our country. We take this matter very seriously, and are following up with the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) as a matter of urgency to seek further clarification around the alleged incident.”Moeen claims he spoke to his England coach, Trevor Bayliss, about the slur, who raised it with the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann. Lehmann then sought an explanation from the player, who denied making the comment.“Lehmann asked the player, ‘Did you call Moeen ‘Osama’?’ He denied it, saying, “No, I said, ‘Take that, you part-timer.’“I must say I was amused when I heard that for there is a world of difference between the words ‘Osama’ and ‘part-timer’,” Moeen writes. “Although I couldn’t have mistaken ‘part-timer’ for ‘Osama’, obviously I had to take the player’s word for it, though for the rest of the match I was angry.”Moeen said the player approached him at the end of the series, at which point he denied making the comment and claimed “some of my best friends are Muslim”.“I did not argue with him,” writes Moeen. “But I was so clear that is what he said. Why should I invent it out of the blue? I’ve got nothing against him. I have never had any fights with him before. I did not even know the guy. And I thought his denial was a standard response.”Earlier this week, Moeen told The Times he had no sympathy for Australia’s banned cricketers and that he finds the whole team “rude”.Australian cricket was thrown into turmoil earlier this year when captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft were banned after a ball-tampering scandal during a Test in South Africa.Much of the cricketing world reacted with a mix of anger and schadenfreude, with media pundits and former players suggesting Australia had brought themselves undone with the aggressive way they played the game.“Everyone you speak to ... they are the only team I’ve played against my whole life that I’ve actually disliked,” Moeen told The Times.Moeen, who had a terrible 2017-18 Ashes in Australia but returned to form to help England beat India 4-1 in the recent test series, said he felt no sympathy for Smith, Warner and Bancroft.“I’m someone who generally feels sorry for people when things go wrong but its difficult to feel sorry for them,” he said. “The first game I ever played against them, in Sydney, just before the 2015 World Cup, they were not just going hard at you, they were almost abusing you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0475d82b915d5d95a2ca13bb353a3bed944484a0/0_107_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58ce2dc3b636e0744704a5a9e5126464","title":"wallabies stunned as argentina post historic victory","story":"Australia slumped to their first home loss to Argentina in 35 years, falling 23-19 in Saturday night’s Rugby Championship Test. The Wallabies were once again left wanting in key departments as an energetic Los Pumas outfit continued their stunning rise under new coach Mario Ledesma.Not since 1983, in the first Test meeting between the two nations, have Argentina tasted victory on Australian soil. But former Wallabies scrum coach Ledesma masterminded a drought-breaking result that will pile enormous pressure back on his old boss Michael Cheika.A long-range penalty from Emiliano Boffelli with three minutes to go sealed a famous victory for Argentina in front of a poor crowd of just 16,019 at Cbus Super Stadium on the Gold Coast.However, Israel Folau bombed a golden chance to win it for the Wallabies after the siren. Folau had an unmarked Bernard Foley to his right but inexplicably chose not to pass the ball to him and instead coughed up possession as he tried to score himself.Australia spent most of the second half searching for the points that would have given them the lead after Dane Haylett-Petty’s 54th-minute try reduced the margin to 20-19. But repeated turnovers and penalties – trademark deficiencies of the Wallabies in recent years – saw them come up with nothing in what proved a miserable night at the office.It didn’t start that way though – three tries in the space of eight minutes early in the first half set the tone for a frenetic clash. First, the Wallabies crossed for the opener after some gorgeous openside play from Haylett-Petty and Reece Hodge to set up Will Genia.Los Pumas responded quickly. Hauled down just short of the tryline, a prone Jeronimo de la Fuente popped up a ball for Nicolas Sanchez to streak through and score. Four minutes later, Folau found himself in space and made the most of it, burning four Argentine defenders with right steps before planting down in the left corner.But the Wallabies could not find another try for the remainder of the half despite enjoying good field position, with their malfunctioning lineout handing Argentina a series of reprieves.The visitors eventually made the most of it, destroying the Australian defence with an energetic 36th-minute counter-attacking burst that finished with Bautista Delguy shrugging off a Haylett-Petty tackle to go under the posts. Sanchez extended Argentina’s lead to six points with a 48th-minute penalty, and they were never headed from there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de45c7d40100dfe550da00c289e807b135e06d16/0_342_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15c5481577d60e65688f1cc8de2478fc","title":"vuelta a espana simon yates goes for victory in decisive stage 20 live","story":"7km to go: Quintana is falling back, with Yates, Mas and López beginning the climb up Coll de la Gallina. Quintana is looking for teammate Valverde but the Spaniard is still 32secs back.8km to go: As it stands, Yates will be 2mins 11secs in front in the GC standings, a gain of more than 30 seconds. Mas has also taken third from Kruijswijk.9km to go: Valverde is part of a 10-man group around 30secs back and increasing. The Spaniard hasn’t shown he has the legs to go with Simon Yates.10.5km to go: A four-man group has now formed out front with Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott), Nairo Quintana (Movistar), Enric Mas (Quick Step) and Miguel Ángel López (Astana). The final climb approaches.14km to go: Simon Yates is bearing down on Quintana and López and, whisper it quietly, could have a stage victory here.16km to go: The Colombia duo of López and Quintana are descending, seven seconds in front of Yates and Mas, who also fancies a podium. If Valverde can’t get going here, and he doesn’t look like he can, Yates could be home and hosed with the real battle for third place.17km to go: And there is the red jersey pulling away and Alejandro Valverde cannot go with him. Enric Mas is the only man who follows the leader with those two closing in on Quintana and then López.17.5km to go: Kruijswijk is part of the group, 17secs behind López and Quintana and may have to push himself soon if he wants to hold onto that podium. The leading duo are about 1km from the top of the Coll de la Comella.18km to go: Impressive stuff from López who has designs on a podium finish as we’ve seen little of Steven Kruijswijk who holds third at present.20km to go: Apologies for the delay there, Eurosport decided to broadcast a Contador feature and about five minutes of adverts... Anyway, Quintana managed to remain in front but now López has accelerated past his countryman on the climb. Simon Yates is part of a group 10 seconds back.27km to go: Simon and Adam Yates both have Quintana in their sights and it’s only a matter of time before the Colombian gets tagged. It was a surprise attack, his second of the stage, but just like the first it hasn’t really worked. The next climb, the fifth of six, is a cat 3 up Coll de la Comella and Mitchelton-Scott could start to take control soon. 30km to go: Quintana has about a five-second lead but doesn’t seem to be getting a significant enough of an advantage of the Mitchelton-Scott chasers. Alejandro Valverde nowhere to be seen as yet. 31km to go: Quintana is off down the descent and has grabbed the race lead as the peloton absorbed the breakaway. Adam Yates is the Mitchelton-Scott rider who has gone with him. 34km to go: López launched an attack just before the peak there but Mollema went with him and took the bonus. Here comes Quintana!35km to go: The question is, when will Movistar make their move? Quintana had a dig in the second ascent but nothing really happened. There are still two big climbs so they have plenty of time but Astana’s move probably wasn’t part of the gameplan. It’s all become further stretched and less predictable than 10km ago. The peloton is 34secs behind Majka who has 1.1km to go on this climb.36km to go: There’s another battle in the peloton with Adam and Simon Yates setting the pace at the front of the peloton, forcing Movistar to follow suit. Majka has opened up a little gap.36.5km to go: Majka, De La Cruz and Mollema now lead with Kwiatkowski dropping back. López, meanwhile, is 21secs behind. Astana are mixing things up. They have around 2km to go until the peak. 37km to go: Astana are picking off riders on by one as they hone in on Kwiatkowski, Majka, Mollema and De la Cruz out in front. The gap is now under 30secs.37.5km to go: That Astana breakaway, including López, has now caught Vincenzo Nibali, 30 seconds behind the lead group. Plates are beginning to shift here.38.5km to go: Astana continue to make Simon Yates work for this, four riders have dragged Lopez up to join them in an attack and they look to be heading for the front group. Somebody is going to have to react...39km to go: It’s a Team Sky 1-2 at the front with Kwiatkowski supported by David de la Cruz. Astana have put Miguel Ángel López at the front of the peloton, driving the pace up the climb.40km to go: The peloton is now under a minute off the leading group. The gap is closing by the kilometre. Team Sky’s Michal Kwiatkowski has the race lead in what looks a very nasty climb. 42km to go: In case you haven’t been counting this is the fourth of the six categorised climbs. 44km to go: And with that Herrada is caught by the chasers and the 16-strong super group has been reformed. Astana still bossing the peloton, Michelton-Scott on their shoulders.46km to go: Herrada has started his climb back up the cat 1 Col de Beixalis and doesn’t look overly delighted with that development. It is steep.Results from the Coll de Ordino (42.3km)50km to go: Herrada descending all on his own with a 22sec lead and the twisty route heads down towards the other side of the Col de Beixalis. The peloton is now 1min 15sec adrift, slowly but surely closing that gap.52.5km to go: The peloton has gained around 30secs on the leaders, with Astana’s pace bringing the gap to 1min 27sec. Not wanting to jinx it but you feel something could happen soon... someone is going to have a go... (please don’t hold me to that).55km to go: Herrada is off into the sunset as nobody fancies following him for now. Astana are continuing to push the pace of the peloton. Simon Yates and Mitchelton-Scott tucked in just behind them.56km to go: We have a new stage leader with Cofidis’ José Herrada making a break and opening up a 10sec gap on the super group. The Spaniard has 500m of the climb remaining. 57.5km to go: Trek’s Gianluca Brambilla is racing on his own at the moment, stuck 1min 15secs behind the leading super group of 15 and 40secs in front of the peloton.58km to go: The Yates brothers weren’t particularly happy with the TV camerabike there, gesticulating for the driver to basically do one, with the vehicle drifting too close to the front of the peloton possibly giving Astana a fraction of a tow.59km to go: Astana have assumed the lead of the peloton and are now pushing the pace. They have young Miguel Ángel López fifth in the GC, 31sec behind Steven Kruijswijk in third.59.5km to go: We’re at that stage where everything is well-formed and everybody is just waiting for someone to make a play. A slightly sad aspect of this route is that 2015 champion Fabio Aru has falled 31mins (yes, minutes) off the lead and is struggling big time. The camera won’t leave the poor bloke alone.60.5km to go: Back with the peloton and it’s Michelton-Scott leading the pack with Movistar on their shoulder. Rafal Majka has also been confirmed as the beneficiary of a juicy three bonus seconds after rolling through an intermediate sprint at 30.2km nobody really sprinted for...62km to go: To confirm the riders who have joined the leaders: Dario Cataldo, Omar Fraile (Astana), Nicolas Roche (BMC), Nelson Oliveira (Movistar), Amanuel Ghebreigzhabier (Dimension Data), Ilnur Zakarin (Katusha Alpecin), David de la Cruz (Team Sky), Jai Hindley (Team Sunweb) and Jesus Herrada (Cofidis). What was six is now 15.63km to go: De Gendt is still at the front of the leading group, pushing the others up the Coll de Ordino. But the six are about to be joined by the counter-attack including Zakarin and Movistar’s Nelson Oliveira, who could become very interesting. The peloton have started ascending and are just under 3mins back.65km to go: The Coll de Ordino looms, a cat 1 climb. Everything has calmed down a bit now with the six riders out in front, one counter-attack 15secs back, including Ilnur Zakarin and Nelson Oliveira, a third led by Gianluca Brambilla a further 50 seconds and then the GC contenders at the front of the peloton, 2mins 30secs off the lead.70km to go: Just to confirm the six riders at the front of the stage: Thomas De Gendt (lotto Soudal), Vincenzo Nibali (Bahrain Merida), Rafal Majka (Bora-Hansgrohe), Michael Woods (Team Education First), Michal Kwiatkowski (Team Sky) and Bauke Mollema (Trek). The GC battle is around 2mins further back. 73km to go: De Gendt claimed that climb, with Mollema second, and looks to have all-but sealed the Mountains classification. The leading riders are descending with De Gendt 2min3sec ahead of third group led by Gianluca Brambilla of Trek and also featuring UAE Team Emirates Fabio Aru and Movistar’s Andrey Amador.76km to go: Movistar starting to manoeuvre their pieces with Andrey Amador and Winner Anacona moving towards the group chasing De Gendt. 78.5km to go: He may be keeping his powder dry for later but Quintana hasn’t really managed to escape from Michelton-Scott. George Bennett of LottoNL-Jumbo also putting in some strong work. De Gendt remains out in front with less than 1km of the climb remaining.

But plans to turn it into a sustainable tourism hub will help protect its people and wildlifeIn the far north of Argentina lies a vast and extremely hot lowland known as the Gran Chaco. Were you to find yourself in it, as I did, you might kayak across a lily-filled lagoon and stumble into a solitary mansion peeking out above an endless sea of green.It was here, at Estancia La Fidelidad, that eccentric rancher Manuel Roseo lived until 2011, when he was brutally murdered by criminals hoping to take his large (and little-touched) property. Thanks to the quick actions of Argentinian conservationists, provincial officials and the federal government, that tragedy had a silver lining with the birth of a new national park that could just shine a light on a forgotten South American wilderness.El Impenetrable national park opened to the public in August 2017, following a telenovela’s worth of drama that included not only Roseo’s murder but the hunt for his missing heirs and a long legal battle to expropriate his land. At 128,000 hectares, it’s now the largest national park in northern Argentina and a beacon of hope for the entire Gran Chaco, which fans out into Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil (where it is connected to the Pantanal region) and is South America’s second-largest forest ecosystem after the Amazon.While the Amazon has become a rallying cry for environmentalists, the bulbous silk floss trees, towering cacti and bushy bramble of the Chaco are disappearing in relative silence. Never as well-known – or as protected – as the Amazon, the Chaco is fast becoming the domain of cattle ranches and soya farms.When my plane landed in the regional capital Resistencia (via Buenos Aires) I had expected a dusty frontier town. Instead, I found a surprisingly lush city that fashions itself as an open-air art museum.Resistencia’s neat and orderly streets are home to some 630 public sculptures, thanks to the Unesco-supported Bienal Internacional de Esculturas (sculpture biennial), and its residents frequent places like the eclectic El Fogón de los Arrieros, a cultural centre-meets-cabinet of curiosities with walls lined with outsider art that puts on evenings filled with tango, jazz and opera.I hadn’t come all this way to tarry in Resistencia, but found it hard to leave. I knew that the transition from this arty enclave into the wilds of greater Chaco province would be stark and startling, and that my ultimate destination, 250 miles away, would be far removed from the comforts of modern civilisation.I spent one evening in town before hopping in a 4x4 (arranged by Daniel Gaona, of Vagabundos Viajes), the following morning. The landscape outside my window on the road out of Resistencia was pancake-flat and swampy green. Salmon-coloured roseate spoonbills waded in muddy puddles, while howler monkeys paraded through riverside trees. Then, rather jarringly, large cattle ranches and soya farms interrupted the pristine surroundings.The World Land Trust claims that one hectare of Gran Chaco forest is lost every minute to these twin causes, yet there remain large tracts of land where South America’s big five – jaguars, pumas, tapirs, giant anteaters and giant armadillos – still roam free. To get there, I had to bump down the dirt roads that penetrate the untamed bush of this “impenetrable” forest, trading the thick, sticky air of the Chaco’s eastern half for the skin-sizzling heat of its arid core.I chose to follow La Ruta de la Cultura Qom, a heritage route launched in 2013 to drive tourism to little-visited communities of the Qom, an indigenous group native to these forests. In the village of Fortín Lavalle, I met Juan Honorio Arguelles of Fundación Gran Chaco, an NGO working with local indigenous communities on reforestation and sustainable development projects.Arguelles introduced me to three local weavers the foundation sponsors and we joined them on a walk through prickly forests to gather the palm fronds they use to weave their baskets. As we strolled through the densely textured vegetation, the women pointed out medicinal plants they use: the shiny leaves of the cocu help with gallbladder problems, a tea made from molle leaves soothes bronchitis and the wispy “old man’s beard” is a moss that tackles everyday foot odours.“The forest has always provided the essentials for the indigenous communities of the Chaco,” Arguelles explained. “Our goal is to give them the tools they need to organise themselves, share their culture and have a sustainable existence right here, because the future lies in the forest.”I travelled west that afternoon from tiny Fortin Lavalle to the agricultural city of Juan José Castelli, the gateway to El Impenetrable. I spent the night at its only lodge, the modern Hotel Portal Del Impenetrable, before departing, at long last, for the park.El Impenetrable is a thick expanse of semi-arid and riparian forests with an herbaceous aroma and the kind of plants and trees that stick up for themselves, with spiky trunks and thorny branches. The Bermejo and Bermejito rivers border the park, making it a wet oasis in the otherwise dry region.Birding is a top draw (there are roughly 350 species here), and to spot some I decided to camp under the shade of gnarled, 300-year-old algarrobo trees at Campamento Los Algarrobos, a riverside campground near the village of Nueva Población, on the park’s south-west edge.Paddling down the murky green Bermejito that afternoon in one of the camp’s kayaks, I spotted great black hawks, little yellow cattle tyrants, slender anhingas (snakebirds) and prehistoric-looking southern screamers.Back on the coral-coloured land the following morning, I ran across white-lipped peccaries (a hog-like animal), a sunbathing yacare caiman, a fast-moving geoffroy’s cat and a massive hole dug by a giant armadillo – though it, like most of the park’s big game, proved elusive.Leonardo Juber, El Impenetrable’s 36-year-old superintendent, told me that many of the animals here are so used to being hunted that they’re not yet habituated to harmless wildlife-watchers. He plans to open a series of three-sided animal hides with attached campsites along at least two of the park’s lagoons to make wildlife viewing more viable.“The Chaco is one of the regions with the most bioersity not only in Argentina, but in all of South America,” he said as we hiked the short Sendero Conejo de los Palos, one of the park’s first trails. It traverses a plain of large, columnar cardón cacti, and is a popular area for Chacoan mara (a rabbit-like rodent).Back in Juan José Castelli the next evening, I made a beeline for Finca Don Miguel. This new farm-to-table restaurant is emblematic of the region’s tourism hopes. It lies on the family farm of rising chef Alina Ruiz and specialises in regional cuisine, including roast squash, jerky stew and fantastic alfajor cookies made from the seeds of algarrobo trees.The gregarious Adrián Contreras joined me for dinner. A fast-talking transplant from Buenos Aires, he’s in charge of Master Plan El Impenetrable, a project to turn this undeveloped region into a hub of sustainable tourism. He told me that step one (due for completion in the first half of 2019) is to build an interactive interpretation centre in Miraflores, a village near the park entrance, and to make the local Qom and Wichí communities caretakers of four new eco-lodges on the park’s edge. The communities will receive appropriate training, equipment (like kayaks and stoves) and spaces to sell their crafts.Contreras admits that there is still much work ahead to arm El Impenetrable with the infrastructure it needs (and deserves) to lure the less intrepid. But it’s an ambitious plan, and it may be exactly what the Gran Chaco has been waiting for: a new economic driver that sees the forest as an asset worth keeping.• The trip was provided by Gran Chaco tourism (chaco.travel)Getting thereAerolineas Argentinas operates several daily flights between Buenos Aires and Resistencia, taking 90 minutes and costing from about £80 return.

But a combination of warmer oceans and more water in the atmosphere could make the devastation of 2017 pale in comparison  There is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane or tropical storm – yet. The highest level – the top of the scale for the most powerful, most devastating hurricane or tropical storm capable of destroying entire cities like New Orleans or New York – is a category 5 storm.Meteorologists and scientists never imagined that there would be a need for a category 6 storm, with winds that exceed 200 miles per hour on a sustained basis, sweeping away everything in its path. Until now, such a storm wasn’t possible, so there was no need for a new category above category 5.This combination of warmer oceans and more water in the earth’s atmosphere – whipsawed by sustained periods of drier and wetter conditions in regions of the world that create superstorms – is now starting to create storms with conditions that look precisely what a category 6 hurricane would look like.No one in America has ever experienced the wrath and fury of a category 6 hurricane, which now genuinely seems possible and realistic. We’ve been lucky. Unofficial category 6 hurricanes have appeared in other parts of the world, and we’re seeing much stronger storms on a regular basis. It’s only a matter of time before one hits the US.When it does, it will come as quite a shock. The devastation we saw in 2017 in Houston, several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico may actually pale in comparison.Jeff Masters, one of the most respected meteorologists in America, has begun to wonder publicly about the potential for a category 6 hurricane. He launched a lively debate among his colleagues with a provocative post in July of 2016 on the Weather Underground – a thought-provoking piece that prompted the Weather Channel and others to weigh in with their thoughts and theories as well.“A ‘black swan’ hurricane – a storm so extreme and wholly unprecedented that no one could have expected it – hit the Lesser Antilles Islands in October 1780,” Masters wrote to open the post. “Deservedly called The Great Hurricane of 1780, no Atlantic hurricane in history has matched its death toll of 22,000. So intense were the winds of the Great Hurricane that it peeled the bark off of trees – something only EF5 tornadoes with winds in excess of 200mph have been known to do.”Masters then made the startling claim that such a “black swan” hurricane was not only possible now but almost certain to occur more than once. He said that such storms should more properly be called “grey swan” hurricanes because the emerging science clearly showed that such “bark-stripping” mega-storms are nearly certain to start appearing.“Hurricanes even more extreme than the Great Hurricane of 1780 can occur in a warming climate, and can be anticipated by combining physical knowledge with historical data,” wrote Masters, who once flew into the strongest hurricane at the time as one of Noaa’s “Hurricane Hunters” in the 1980s. “Such storms, which have never occurred in the historical record, can be referred to as ‘grey swan’ hurricanes.”Masters based his bold prediction on research by two of the best hurricane scientists in the world – Kerry Emanuel of MIT and Ning Lin of Princeton – who published the most detailed hurricane model in history in August 2015. Emanuel and Lin’s hurricane model was embedded within six different worldwide climate models routinely run by supercomputers.“The term ‘black swan’ is a metaphor for a high-consequence event that comes as a surprise. Some high-consequence events that are unobserved and unanticipated may nevertheless be predictable,” they wrote in Nature Climate Change. “Such events may be referred to as ‘grey swans’ (or, sometimes, ‘perfect storms’). Unlike truly unpredicted and unavoidable black swans, which can be dealt with only by fast reaction and recovery, grey swans – although also novel and outside experience – can be better foreseen and systematically prepared for.”Lin and Emanuel said their research showed that not only were grey swan hurricanes now likely to occur, one such devastating hurricane would almost certainly hit the Persian Gulf region – a place where tropical cyclones have never even been seen in history. They identified a “potentially large risk in the Persian Gulf, where tropical cyclones have never been recorded, and larger-than-expected threats in Cairns, Australia, and Tampa, Florida”.Emanuel and Lin showed that the risk of such extreme grey swan hurricanes in Tampa, Cairns, and the Persian Gulf increased by up to a factor of 14 over time as Earth’s climate changed.In the event of such a storm, city officials may have no idea what they truly face. At least one city planning document (from 2010) anticipated that a category 5 hurricane could cause 2,000 deaths and $250bn in damage. But it could be far worse.“A storm surge of 5 meters is about 17 feet, which would put most of Tampa underwater, even before the sea level rises there,” Emanuel told reporters. “Tampa needs to have a good evacuation plan, and I don’t know if they’re really that aware of the risks they actually face.”A city like Dubai is even more unprepared, Emanuel said. Dubai, and the rest of the Persian Gulf, has never seen a hurricane in recorded history. Any hurricane, of any magnitude, would be an unprecedented event. But his models say that one is likely to occur there at some point.“Dubai is a city that’s undergone a really rapid expansion in recent years, and people who have been building it up have been completely unaware that that city might someday have a severe hurricane,” Emanuel said. “Now they may want to think about elevating buildings or houses, or building a seawall to somehow protect them, just in case.”Following Masters’s provocative post, many of his meteorologist colleagues weighed in. The Weather Channel predicted that a category 6 hurricane, and a change in the scale to accommodate it, may be on its way.“Jeff Masters got the entire weather community thinking: could there be a Category Six hurricane?” Brian Donegan wrote on the network’s site. “Last year, Hurricane Patricia reached maximum sustained winds of 215mph in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.”Whether we call them category 6 hurricanes – or simply category 5 hurricanes with really fast, violent winds that are up to 60mph above the upper end of the current scale that can appear literally overnight over warm oceans – we need to be ready for these superstorms capable of taking out cities like Dubai or Tampa. They are here, right now. The devastation we saw in Houston, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in the fall of 2017 is a clear warning.We ignore the implications at our peril.Adapted from This Is The Way The World Ends, copyright © 2018 by Jeff Nesbit.

If you’re not already receiving it by email, subscribe.At first glance, Thursday wasn’t a good night for the progressive “insurgent wing” of the Democratic party in New York: their gubernatorial candidate, Cynthia Nixon, lost by a 30-point margin to incumbent Andrew Cuomo. Their other statewide candidates for lieutenant governor, Jumaane Williams, and attorney general, Zephyr Teachout, came up short, too.But down the ballot, the primary results offered a significant silver lining: challengers crushed a group of state senate Democrats who for years had allied with the senate’s Republicans, handing them control of the chamber in Albany, the state capital. Six of the eight members of the now-defunct group, known as the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), went down in defeat.The group’s leader, Bronx senator Jeff Klein, lost despite spending more than $2m on his re-election race. H was brought down by Alessandra Biaggi, a 32-year-old former Hillary Clinton staffer.New York City senators Tony Avella, Marisol Alcantara, Jose Peralta and Jesse Hamilton, and David Valesky upstate, were the other losers from that group.The string of wins for their challengers is all the more remarkable when you consider that in New York state legislative races, incumbents almost never lose. Over the last decade, there has never been a year when more than three legislators lost.At an election night party in Brooklyn organized by the liberal Working Families party, liberals disappointed by the governor’s race quickly turned to touting the senate results as they sipped beer and nibbled Caribbean food.“We wiped them off the map,” party political director Bill Lipton told the , as he made the rounds making the case that the night’s results weren’t all bad. “We didn’t checkmate Andrew Cuomo, but we completely remade the game around him.”Nixon, too, praised the “brilliant insurgent campaigns” even as she conceded to Cuomo in her own race.“The blue wave is real, and it’s not only coming for Republicans, it is coming for Democrats who act like them,” she said in her concession speech.To make the wins count, Democrats will have to flip one more senate seat in November to claim full control of the state legislature.The IDC was a convoluted formulation for the start, allowing a select group of Democrats to trade their support for Republican leadership for more funds for their districts.In part because it was so arcane, attacks on the group for years failed to penetrate with voters. That changed this year, as activist groups made the successful case that New Yorkers should reject politicians they labeled “Trump Democrats”.Jessica Ramos, 33, another first-time candidate, won by a healthy 10-point margin over Peralta in Queens. “The IDC better be dead,” she told reporters at her victory party, according to the Queens Chronicle. “New Yorkers are pissed. They’re tired of being lied to. They’re tired of government not working for them. They’re sick of it.”With the victory of Molly Kelly in the Democratic primary for governor in New Hampshire, a record 15 women have now won gubernatorial nominations this year.There are currently only six women serving as governors.The female nominees are a erse group – Kelly, a former state senator, was considered the party establishment favorite and defeated an opponent who ran to her left. Stacey Abrams in Georgia could be become the country’s first black female governor, and Christine Hallquist in Vermont would be first transgender woman to hold the job.Look out for a special piece by the ’s David Smith next week on the gubernatorial race in Georgia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969987086584aa3b89073759a7698c4b9b274186/0_6_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c1dabd91259209a7f35a0120b87d3ac","title":"palestine israel us peace plan saeb erekat","story":"Chief negotiator Saeb Erekat says US is trying to change terms of reference: ‘I don’t think they will ever introduce a plan’The US will not present its long-awaited plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace any time soon and is instead trying to unilaterally change the terms of reference for any future proposal, a senior Palestinian official said on Saturday.Echoing deep scepticism among the Palestinians, Arab countries and analysts, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, said the Trump administration was siding with Israel on the core issues of the decades-old conflict, burying all chances for Middle East peace.“I don’t think they will ever introduce a plan,” Erekat said in Jericho. “The whole world is rejecting their ideas. They are already implementing their plan by changing the terms of reference.”Doubts have mounted over whether Trump’s administration can secure what he has called the “ultimate deal” since December, when the president recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the US embassy there.Jerusalem is one of the major issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both sides claim it as a capital. Trump’s move outraged the Palestinians, who have boycotted Washington’s peace efforts, led by the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The US has also cut off aid to the Palestinians and to UNRWA – the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees – and has ordered the PLO office in Washington shut, further angering Palestinian leaders.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday welcomed the latest US moves.Erekat said it appeared the US has accepted Israel’s positions on other main issues of the conflict, and not just Jerusalem, including the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees from wars dating to 1948 and Israeli settlements on land Palestinians envisage as part of their future state.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, told Reuters Washington was prepared for Israeli criticism of the plan and that both sides can expect parts they will like and dislike. He provided no further details.Greenblatt, a chief architect of the initiative, said US negotiators had entered the “pre-launch phase” of the plan, despite the boycott by Palestinian leaders, but declined to specify a time frame.The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It regards all of the city as its eternal and inisible capital.US officials have so far been non-committal about whether their plan would endorse the creation of a Palestinian state beside the state of Israel – the goal of previous rounds of negotiations, the last of which collapsed in 2014.“They are telling us ‘peace based on the truth’,” Erekat said.Palestinians have limited self-rule in the West Bank but Israel controls most of that territory and has expanded its settlements there. Most countries deem the settlements illegal, though Israel disputes this. It withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, which is ruled by the Islamist Hamas movement.“The only thing this administration did since it came to office is just to take Israelis and Palestinians off the path to peace, off the path of the two-state solution,” Erekat said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77aa3e5ef9ebaff7a6b14c6c11ee04537dfe7d13/0_88_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b72009dc9be2b92e501a4fd33aea47b","title":"return to refugee camps 30 years on dina nayeri","story":"Dina Nayeri was eight when she and her family fled Iran. Are today’s refugees treated with more dignity?There have been days, months, when I’ve eaten meals provided by charities, governments, good people. When I was 10, I lived in a refugee camp outside Rome, a temporary safe space for transients seeking asylum outside Italy. The Italian government had leased the building from a hotel owner though our clothes and sheets were those of refugees, we lived on a hilltop, in the husk of a pretty hotel.Each day, the residents of hotel Barba were served soup, pasta, coffee, meat, bread. In the mornings, we stampeded for jam. We were given three meals at precise times. When my mother found an English school an hour away by bus, we had to find a way to claim our lunches or they would be lost. She enlisted the help of an Afghan grandmother – she would save our lunches for us, we would eat them for dinner, then we would make sandwiches out of our dinners, hang them in a plastic bag over a balcony and take them to school the next day. The process was embarrassing and very visible. The bringing in of the lunches, now cold, to the canteen at dinner time, the packing away of the fresher dinners. The hotel served hard, round bread rolls and we filled them with peas and mashed potatoes, with pasta and chicken, slices of meat under carrot, letting the gravy soak and soften the bread overnight. To this day, leftover sandwiches evoke survival for me – they bring dread, the pleasure of having solved a puzzle, and also shame.A few years later, after my family had been granted asylum and sent to Oklahoma and I fancied myself an American teenager, I began volunteering at a local food bank. My friend and I were assigned to the storeroom. Poor mothers or single men would arrive in the front, sign in at the desk, tell their stories to more experienced volunteers, and we, the teenagers in the back, would receive instruction about which category of grocery bundle to make. Everyone got the same things, with a few extras for babies and some substitutions for allergies. They never saw our faces, the silly adolescents who flirted and sang while we chose their food: tuna or chicken, white or wheat, pulp or no pulp. I got rid of all the chunky peanut butter first, thinking I was being kind. I was grateful that I didn’t see their faces, that I could avoid the downcast eyes as I loaded their bags into open trunks.Accepting charity is an ugly business for the spirit. It rubs you raw, especially if you were once someone with pride and lofty goals, someone who shook hands and locked eyes. My mother and I used to talk about the irony of so many of the world’s refugees coming from the Middle East – we are such prideful people, and a refugee is the most abject creature of all: stateless, homeless, without control over her own food, education or health. Asylum seekers is so mild a phrase – we weren’t politely seeking, we were ravenous for it, this animal need for safety for our bodies. How do we survive the memory of it?After Oklahoma, I spent two decades working on my pride. I accepted no charity from friends. When we went out, I ate little. When one of their parents paid, it felt like a big deal, as if I had lost control. I didn’t borrow change for vending machines. I did accept the charity of universities, as it was hidden from view and kinder. Later on, I allowed men to pay for meals, telling myself that my company was enough to compensate – that this is how the world’s least indebted women behave and so should I.In my 30s in New York, I volunteered to help a friend, a well-meaning finance type, serve Thanksgiving dinner at a homeless shelter. I showed up in a stained T-shirt and old jeans, my hair in a ratty bun. There was no question of what to wear I knew that tonight I would offer food to a stranger, and that stranger would, for a moment, be humiliated. She would look at my clothes, my posture, for a reason to say: “Who cares what she thinks?” And it was part of my job to give her that reason quickly. I remembered that at hotel Barba, a young man serving soup would call out: “Zuppa! Zuppa!” He’d make a clown of himself, so we could laugh sometimes, he would sit for a chat, eat some soup, ask how we were. The zuppa man was beloved at hotel Barba and I imagined myself in his shoes. I stuck $10 in my pocket, leaving my wallet behind.But Manhattan do-gooders don’t know the quiet bargains that the poor make in the space of a glance. When I arrived at the shelter, my friend looked me up and down. “Are you depressed?” he joked, eyeing my stains. Behind him, bankers and lawyers in Chanel shoes and white silk shirts, leather handbags still on their arms, dished out mashed potatoes and uneasy smiles to tired men and women wearing the grime of the city. Later on, when the residents invited the volunteers to join their table (a plea for dignity), the volunteers declined out of concern (“Will there be enough?”). They dashed off to a fancy restaurant instead, ordered pork belly and congratulated themselves for not staying (“It would’ve been overstepping”), then complained about the tourists crowding the door. I confess that I ate a few bites of that turkey dinner, and I ate the pork belly, too, and I let my friend pay, humiliating as it was given my stained T-shirt, my sweaty hair. I hated him that night, but I was also grateful to be in his company. I went home and threw it all up.Now, a few more years have passed. I’m a writer in London, a mother, a confused immigrant. A lifelong chameleon, I’m reimagining my identity again. Am I still a refugee after so many years of assimilating?I spend a lot of time thinking about hotel Barba. In 2011, I went back. It had become a proper hotel, with pretty curtains and nice sheets. I know now that Barba was a “low hardship” camp. I hate that term. It’s condescending and a lie. The accurate description is that it was something other than hell. It wasn’t Moria in Lesbos, with its raw sewage and midnight wars, its five-hour food lines and shared tents on open soil. Officially, hotel Barba was a refugee camp. But I call it a hostel, because it wasn’t a camp. It wasn’t a hotel, either. The difference between each pair of words is subtle, a private calculation of shame and place and dignity.Late last autumn in a London cafe, I spoke with Paul Hutchings about life in the camps and the possibility of my returning to one. He co-founded Refugee Support, a charity that goes from camp to camp revamping the way they distribute aid. Right away, he started up about dignity and shame. Like me, he had stayed up nights thinking about humiliation. Hutchings met John Sloan in October 2015 while volunteering in the Calais camp. The two men noticed that the act of offering food and clothing, these undeniably first-order needs, had become so urgent and frantic that the “how” was forgotten. The only people who seemed aware were the refugees Hutchings saw it in their eyes, in their gait. Though they had already lost so much, they were losing more with every jacket tossed from a truck-bed and every ill-fitting pair of trousers they would have to barter away. In Calais, provisions were handed out from the backs of vans. One day, a van would arrive with, say, large jackets and park in one part of the camp. Another day, a different van with men’s jeans, or T-shirts, would park in another corner. Refugees lined up as a volunteer tried to keep order, and another asked their size. They received one item and were asked to go. Some tried to negotiate, claiming to have a sick friend, a parent too weak to stand in line. Others fought and yelled and grabbed. Items were trampled on the ground. Some went away empty-handed. No one felt good about what had just happened.“Wouldn’t it be nice,” said Hutchings in the cafe, “if we could give people food and clothing without taking away their dignity?”“Why is that so hard?” I asked.“Because people want every hour and dollar they give to be stretched thin.” Hutchings told me that his biggest problem was the volunteers, donors, and their lofty expectations. Many donors want to assign criteria to how their food is given out. They want their money feeding as many as possible, to make sure you spend it only on eggs and bread. They want to police. They don’t care about the “how”. Even the most good-hearted volunteers want to feel thanked. Refugee Support began its work in April 2016 at Alexandreia camp near Thessaloniki, Greece. They set out to open a food store, then a clothing store, a well-designed, peaceful marketplace stocked with donations, where a person of note wouldn’t be ashamed to shop. When Hutchings showed me photographs, I thought: my mother, an Iranian doctor, would shop there. My grandfather, a landowner, would be proud to run into a neighbour there. It was a far cry from the item-specific trucks.At first, residents made appointments and collected prepared baskets of food, thoughtfully arranged with necessities for each family. Everyone received the same thing, regardless of allergies, habits or taste. But people didn’t have the same needs, and soon there were grumblings, barter, waste.Hutchings and Sloan decided to display the goods and give people the respect of choosing for themselves. The store’s currency would be points distributed weekly like income – 100 points per adult, 50 per child, 150 for pregnant women. Store prices would be pegged to market prices (20 points per euro). Sanitary items would be free. If residents wanted to spend all their points on chocolate spread, they had that right.On his phone, Hutchings showed me designs for Katsikas, the newest camp, near Ioannina, closer to the Albanian border than to Athens. He spends time thinking of the aesthetics, whether people will like it – he cares that they like it. He has sales data, too, and a list of what he needs to stock each week. Yes, the customers (his word) buy some butter biscuits, but they don’t sacrifice milk for it.“You know what I love?” Hutchings asked. “When they complain about the selection. Because that means they’ve forgotten they’re in a camp. They’re just people in a store, with money in hand, complaining about yoghurt.”“I want to go,” I said.“We have rules,” he said, “We need to keep absolute equality between people, so there’s no hint of special treatment. We don’t allow socialising or friendships. Volunteers can’t even accept a cup of tea or enter the private rooms.”“Are there Iranians there?” I asked. “Or Afghans who speak Farsi?”“There will be at Katsikas when it opens,” he said.“I want to go without your rule,” I said, thinking of that long-ago turkey dinner that everyone turned down. If this is about pride, I have to be able to accept a cup of tea.“The complicated thing is that dignity changes as different needs are met,” Hutchings told me a few weeks later, as we drove on a pitch-black highway, slick with rain, away from Athens. “When you arrive from Lesbos, dirty, tired, starving, dignity is that package of shampoo, deodorant, eggs, coffee, bread. So we offer that on arrival. Then, when you’ve showered and slept and cleaned up, that package becomes humiliating. You want your tea, not coffee. You remember you hate eggs. That’s when you want choice. After you’ve lived in a camp for a few months, the store with fake money and strict friendship rules becomes humiliating, too. Why can’t you befriend the clerk? There’s a shelf-life to this. We don’t stay at any camp because we don’t want to contribute to the camp becoming permanent.” We were visiting two camps on this trip, but our ultimate destination was Katsikas. I had put on a brave, eager face, but I was afraid of what I would see and remember.Just before Christmas 2017, 450 refugees from 10 countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq, arrived at the empty camp at Katsikas. Awaiting them were Isoboxes, residential containers in a gated field, each kitted out with kitchenette and bathroom, beds on metal frames. Almost everyone was arriving from Moria, the hell in Lesbos, and from similar inhospitable camps on the islands. The store staff prepared for opening day. No one expected chaos they knew that when you grant people dignity, they become dignified. The refugees walk through the store, looking they choose olive or sunflower oil, the one they prefer. They are treated as the doctors and teachers and craftsmen they once were.On my first day, the store opened as usual, 10.30am until 1pm. It was clean and whimsically decorated, with cheese graters as light fixtures, little plants here and there, vegetables neatly piled in rows. It looked like a food cooperative in south London. An iPad served as the sole point of sale, though later a second “register” was added with pad and paper. Behind the produce was the storeroom, left open so volunteers could fetch nappies and extra bags. No one worried about theft. Outside, a long hallway featured art by camp residents, including a haunting sketch of a laden boat at night, refugees on open water. Tables and chairs were set up where families waited their turn. Here was the first difference between this store and any other: only one family could shop at a time.Another point of difference: no one, no matter how compelling their story, ever gets an exception. On my second afternoon in the store, a young couple, newly pregnant, came back after their shop. The husband said he counted the items and it came up 50 short. Nothing could be done. “It’s not about the inidual,” Hutchings said. There could be no whiff of case-by-case judgments, or the possibility of favouritism, on the camp.For most of my time at the store, I bagged groceries, just as I did in Oklahoma. This time, I had no say in what went into the bags. But after the second family passed through, I noticed other peculiarities of this store: in a way, we did tell them what they could have, because we controlled the points. The envelope full of paper money is largely symbolic, since almost everyone spends all that they have on the first market day after the points are issued. They hand over the entire envelope and the volunteer keeps track of their shopping. At some point the volunteer says, “Only 10 left” or, “You’re 10 over”, and the family begins to make trade-offs. Private discussions are had. Children jump in, biting their nails. Juice boxes are sacrificed.The first time this happened, I realised I had bagged too soon. I had been over-zealous. I had to stop, wait to see what would be put back. I had bagged the children’s bananas, and now I remembered how rare bananas were in Iran, how desperate I had been for them and how that desperation lasted all through my teenage years, after bananas became ordinary. I wanted to ask Hutchings if we could just let them have it, but stood by, feeling useless and ham-fisted as the parents explained that the bananas would have to go back.Later on, as a young Syrian mother and I were trying to arrange her six sacks in a chubbily occupied buggy – the baby leaning forward, accustomed to sharing his space – I heard the familiar, easy sounds of Farsi. An older Iranian couple entered, handing over their envelope (200 points, no children). I listened as they spoke in the language of everyday shopping. “How much” is this or that? “Is the olive oil worth the price?” It was beautiful to enter this brief fantasy. For 10 minutes, they were a couple in some European city, doing their weekend shopping.Then they went 10 points over. The wife bit her lip. “We have to put the biscuits back,” she said.The husband scanned the items.“But we’d be five under.” I imagined them back in their Isobox with their cups of tea, the cardamom they had smuggled from Iran. Butter cookies are just the thing with tea.They took a tomato paste and stood at the register.Then I did something stupid: I said hello in Farsi, wished them a good day. They stared at me, stunned, said polite hellos. I realised I had punctured that brief fantasy of a normal life that Hutchings had envisioned perhaps this was the reason for the no chit-chat rule. The fact that I had understood their private negotiations made plain that they were part of a charade, that this was a charity shop. I begged the universe to rewind by five seconds, to make it so I wasn’t the same as those Thanksgiving volunteers in New York, the ones whose help had come at such high costs.I started bagging their things and, for a second time in my life, was glad for having dressed shabbily.When the store was closed, I walked through the rows of Isoboxes, knocking on doors. It was intimidating and thrilling. Again, I asked myself, what the hell am I doing? Who would answer? Would they speak Farsi? Would they invite me in? I memorised the door numbers for the Farsi households.A kind couple in their 30s opened the first door. I had found them through their daughters, who were playing soccer outside. I’d heard delighted shrieks in the language of my own childhood, and made a beeline for the sound. “Are you police?” the older girl asked. “No, I’m an Iranian lady looking for other Iranians.” She gave me their Isobox number. The parents invited me in. Hutchings sat with us, happy to listen without understanding as they told us the story of their escape. After several hours, the talk turned to the store and they said something I would hear from every other Iranian at Katsikas: get basmati rice. They pulled out the rice from the store, then the rice they had bought with their own money. The husband compared the grains. “See how much longer?” Hutchings nodded. It was simply that a volunteer had found a good deal on this rice. “Can I come back tomorrow?” I asked the couple. “Yes,” the husband said. “Actually, you will come back thrice. Things always happen to us in threes. Three boats before Moria. Three tries before getting here. Always three.”Before we left, they showed us videos of Moria, toilets overrun by sewage where people also bathed, tents on raw earth, children begging to leave. The husband asked for help with the immigration process. I didn’t know what to say – the photos were scenes from a nightmare, and I felt so obtuse for having revealed my own asylum story. Hutchings kept his face neutral. “I’m sorry, we can’t help. We don’t know asylum law. Yes, we’ll look into the basmati.” Later, he told me that it’s a mistake even to provide reassurance, because the residents grasp at every hope. The videos and pleas for help happened in every Isobox I visited.By now, we are accustomed to horrifying footage from refugee camps. We forget the psychological damage of purgatory. This waiting space, in which you can never go back to your old life and identity, but haven’t been told yet what your new one will be. Will your children have to learn German, Italian or English? Will you work in your old profession again? Will 2030 find you lecturing in a university again, or driving an Uber, washing dishes, cleaning homes with a fraction of the books you once owned? These questions torture the mind, yet the world says: “They made it out! They’re safe. We did it!” Then they toss food out of truck beds, provide shelter in tents. But charity and welcome are different things.The next day, I knocked on a door and found a group of women having tea and rolling dough. They were Afghans and Iranians, and immediately they called me inside. They had heard about me. They gave me tea. I made myself comfortable on a pillow between two motherly ones. They had an old pasta maker acquired in Ioannina and were turning all their flour into pasta. They pointed to a small room where thin ropes of dough were drying on a bedframe, the mattress stashed away somewhere. “This is for Iranian noodle soup,” said one of them. “We’re making enough for everyone.” The women told me that every night they got together in someone’s Isobox for prayer and dinner. I promised to join them. Later that night, I found the same group, with their daughters and granddaughters, including one who had been born in the camp, having a birthday party, dancing and cheering.Before we arrived at Katsikas, Hutchings and I had stopped at LM village, near Kilini, a camp that Refugee Support had just left. Perhaps it was better for me to see the ghost of the store before I saw the living one. I wanted to go there because it was built in the carcass of an old holiday village, much like Barba. I hoped that it would rub away my calluses and I’d regain something of those days. Hutchings’ store was a shambles, clothes trampled on the floor, children rummaging through, a Greek worker on her phone, oblivious. Hutchings walked through the wreck of the store he had built, shaking his head, his shoulders dropping.The commander of the camp followed us around, nervous. He thought that Sloan and Hutchings had left because of his behaviour and he was trying to appease. They hadn’t, of course. But he was a fiery sort, and when Refugee Support left, the refugees barred the gates in protest, thinking the commander had shut the store down. He turned to me as we walked: “Dina, when you’re in the car, tell him every 20 minutes to come back to LM.” He was silent for a while, then said: “Tell him every 10 minutes to come back.”Hutchings didn’t respond. He seemed to be working through larger questions. Was his hard work gone? Did the refugees carry it away with them, their spirits stronger now?At LM, we ate with a Syrian family. The commander joined us. We couldn’t bear to touch the meagre food, knowing it had been bought with precious euros. But the family had refused to let us go the elderly mother of 10 grabbed my backpack and held it to her breast. We would have insulted them. This wasn’t like that New York Thanksgiving: they needed this food. Nevertheless, pride wins over hunger and we stayed.On my last day in Greece, as the store was closing and I was saying my goodbyes, a bewildered man in his mid-40s wandered into the waiting area. I could tell by his face he was Iranian. I greeted him in Farsi and he looked relieved. He said he had just arrived. He had no clothes, no food. He wasn’t registered at the store yet. The volunteers looked at his papers and agreed to keep the store open so he could shop. They told him to return at 3pm and they would open the men’s clothing store so he could have his 10 items. He was larger than average. I hoped he would find something.Since he knew nothing of the point system, I helped him choose his food. He got eggs, rice, a kilo of bananas, oil. Then he put back the oil. He got cookies and pistachios, milk. He put back the milk. He didn’t get much else. As his last 20 points wouldn’t buy oil, he bought four juice boxes instead. He left happy, nodding his thanks to everyone.As I started for the car, I thought of how nervous I had been to revisit this strange waiting place, this limbo that had shaped me, that was now shaping thousands of others from my home. We would be for ever linked and defined by it. And how much I had forgotten that was now clear and urgent. I remembered something else. I ran back into the camp, found a door and knocked. I had knocked on this door twice already. Yesterday, the husband had said, “No need for goodbye. Remember?

But they’re not – they’ve got this rather selective deficit,” says Brian Butterworth, professor of cognitive neuropsychology at University College London.Do you find it impossible to calculate tips in restaurants? Does the prospect of calculating how many tiles you need for your kitchen fill your with dread? Do you struggle with calculating change? Have you always struggled to remember maths tables?Then, there’s a chance you suffer from dyscalculia, a specific learning disorder in maths.This week, researchers in Northern Ireland published research which found that many children are suffering from this developmental condition but are not aware of it.A team of academics at Queen’s University Belfast examined the performance of more than 2,400 primary schoolchildren and found that some 112 children had a specific learning disorder in maths.However, just one of these children had been previously diagnosed with dyscalculia.The prevalence of the condition is estimated to be about 6 to 6.5 per cent. While this rate similar to dyslexia – which affects reading and spelling – there is far less awareness of dyscalculia.In fact, the research team estimates that a child with dyslexia is more than 100 times as likely to receive an official diagnosis and educational support than one with dyscalculia.So why are so few children being diagnosed?Máirín Barry, a former lecturer on special education needs at the UCD school of education, says there is far less awareness of the conditions even among specialists.While it was first identified in the 1970s, there is still relatively little known about dyscalculia. “We have a lot of catching up to do in terms of our understanding of dyscalculia,” she says.“The priority was literacy – to get everybody literate and able to leave school with the ability to read and write.“Dyscalculia is much more hidden because people accepted that not being able to read and write was a major obstacle, but not being able to do maths is much more socially acceptable.”If it is diagnosed at a younger age by an educational psychologist, there are techniques to help children to develop a better “number sense” through use of physical counting materials.The education system, she says, doesn’t always recognise this.“You’re trying to make sure that numbers seem real to children – because they find them so abstract. They have no real sense of numbers.“So, our support systems needs to be more open-minded in helping these children to get a better understanding of numbers.”Without learning support, numeracy problems can be reinforced at school. “Traditional teaching methods, while very effective at developing calculation skills if you have a good rote memory, tend not to develop good understanding of maths,” says Barry.“This continues through the system, and you end up with people who in their daily lives agonise over how to pay a tip or how much material to order.”Another issue, at least in the past, is the rigid, diagnosis-driven way special education supports have been delivered. Up until just over a year ago, schools were not able to apply for resource-teaching hours for dyscalculia.Under a new system, schools now have much more flexibility to use supports depending on the level of need in the classroom.Among adults, dyscalculia can be hard to spot as it is compounded by other factors, such as maths anxiety and poor teaching methods. The issue of hidden difficulties with numeracy also raises the wider issue of maths anxiety.Many adults presented with a maths problem either clam up or else proudly wear their poor maths ability as a badge of honour.Dr Pádraig Kirwan, head of Waterford Institute of Technology’s department of computing and mathematics, sees this regularly among Irish students. “In China and other Asian countries, they don’t seem to have this an issue on anywhere near the same level. Maths is a treated like a subject in the same way as any other.”He suggests there may be cultural or teaching issues that lie behind some of the wider anxiety around maths.Kirwan, for example, recalls his daughter being taught a basic maths technique in primary schools that was wrong. “I was able to correct it for her, but other children in the class didn’t have the benefit of that.”For those who genuinely suffer from dyscalculia, it presents real lifelong problems.Research in the UK has shown that adults with numeracy problems – of which people with dyscalculia are one group – are significantly disadvantaged.By the age of 30, those with low numeracy have lower employment prospects, earn less, are more likely to suffer from physical and mental illness and are more likely to get in trouble with law.There is often a general assumption that women are affected more than men, and that maths and maths anxiety contribute to the barriers that keep women underrepresented in the Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths).In the case of dyscalculia, however, Dr Kinga Morsanyi – who led the team of experts from Queen’s University Belfast’s school of psychology behind this week’s research – says they found no gender differences, either in the prevalence of dyscalculia, or of exceptionally high performance in mathematics“In society, there is sadly a widespread notion that you need a special talent to be good at maths, and that struggling with maths is normal for some people, but this is not the case and it’s not something we would accept if a pupil was unable to read,” she says.“It is important to raise awareness of dyscalculia, as numeracy difficulties often lead to problems in later life, including greatly reduced employment opportunities, increased health risks and an increased risk of involvement with the criminal justice system.”Brian Butterworth, professor of cognitive neuropsychology at University College London, and an expert in dyscalculia, has said the biggest challenge for dyscalculia agrees that getting wider recognition for the condition.“Kids who can’t learn arithmetic are regarded as being stupid. But they’re not – they’ve got this rather selective deficit,” he told The  recently.“Recognition would mean that sufferers would have access to specialised help, just as sufferers from dyslexia do. Specialised help would raise their mathematical competence and make them more able to cope with the demands of a numerate society.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3629452.1536954953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach denies u turn on mandatory open disclosure for doctors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has denied that he and the Government performed a U-turn on whether to introduce mandatory open disclosure in the health service. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has denied that he and the Government performed a U-turn on whether to introduce mandatory open disclosure in the health service.An amendment allowing for voluntary open disclosure was inserted into the Bill instead.Dr Gabriel Scally’s report for the Government into the controversy around the non-disclosure of smear test audit results to women with cervical cancer tested by the CervicalCheck screening programme criticised the policy and practice of open disclosure.He described the policy and practice as “deeply contradictory and unsatisfactory.”The Northern Irish public health expert said there was “no compelling requirement” on doctors to disclose and that it was left up to their personal and professional judgment.Mr Varadkar said the Government would introduce mandatory open disclosure – one of 50 recommendations made by Dr Scally – that would compel doctors by law to admit any mistakes to their patients.“I explained that before,” the Taoiseach said on Friday of the events last year. “It wasn’t a U-turn. We made a particular set of decisions that we would ensure that it was policy first and it has been policy for a very long time.“Secondly, that we would legislate to protect open disclosure on a voluntary basis and that we would then legislate after that for mandatory open disclosure. That is what we are going to do. That’s what is in my party’s manifesto back in 2016, long before the CervicalCheck scandal broke and was also in the programme for government.”Dr Scally is continuing his investigation in one of the foreign labs used by CervicalCheck to examine Irish smear tests.Clinical Pathology Laboratories, the US laboratory that Dr Scally found outsourced Irish smear tests to five other US labs without the HSE’s knowledge, examined the smears of Lorraine Walsh and Irene Teap, the late wife of Stephen Teap.CPL, which was used by CervicalCheck from 2010 to 2013, was also the lab that settled the High Court action taken by Limerick women Vicky Phelan over a misinterpreted 2011 smear test.Ms Walsh, Mr Teap and Ms Phelan are the patient representatives who engaged with Dr Scally on behalf of the 221 women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy.About 300,000 smear test slides were reported by CPL to CervicalCheck.Dr Scally has said he is satisfied that the quality management processes were “adequate” in CPL."},{"url":null,"title":"housing activists stage sit down on luas tracks in dublin city centre","story":"  September 13, 2018Balaclava-wearing garda\u0026iacute helping remove protesters only inflames an already tense situation   September 13, 2018Notice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunction   September 13, 2018Protesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre property "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3629655.1536946768!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps call for ban on irish fishing vessels after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Court ruled in October 2016 that the so-called Voisinage Agreement, an informal arrangement dating from the 1960s and limited to small fishing vessels, had to be provided for in legislation if it was to continue.  Photograph: Chris FurlongGetty ImagesIrish fishing vessels should be excluded from UK waters as soon as Britain leaves the European Union next March unless the Government resolves a dispute over fishing rights, a committee of MPs has recommended. In a report on fisheries after Brexit, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee says Ireland’s unilateral suspension of a mutual fishing rights deal was causing hardship to fishermen in Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court ruled in October 2016 that the so-called Voisinage Agreement, an informal arrangement dating from the 1960s and limited to small fishing vessels, had to be provided for in legislation if it was to continue. The Government introduced a bill to address the issue but its passage through the Oireachtas was delayed after fishing groups warned that its wording could allow large British vessels to fish in Irish waters.“We are disappointed that the Voisinage Arrangement has been unilaterally suspended in Ireland. While Irish fishermen have access to waters in Northern Ireland, fishermen in Northern Ireland have suffered hardship through exclusion from their habitual fishing grounds. This needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency,” the committee’s report says.“We recommend the Government structures talks with the Irish Government to establish the future of reciprocal access for Northern Irish vessels under the Voisinage Arrangement. “If the Irish Government does not give a clear commitment to pass, within six months of publication of this report, legislation which restores reciprocal access, the Government must discontinue access to UK waters for Irish vessels from March 30th, 2019. “If the Irish Government does pass legislation to reinstate the Voisinage Arrangement, then the UK Government should consider whether the arrangement should also be put on statutory footing in UK law.”The report also calls for an early resolution to the dispute between the British and Irish governments over the delimitation of maritime borders in cross-Border Loughs Foyle and Carlingford.

We encourage the participants to make draw them with big eyes, a smile, give them a name and use bright colours.“In the 4 hour workshop we use a varied approach which includes hypnotherapy, NLP, art therapy, education and desensitisation alongside immersive therapy where they hold the tarantulas, capture and release a house spider and hold a house spider.”Using art therapy is seen as a treatment which causes far less emotional distress than traditional remedies based on persuading patients to directly confront the spiders.The ‘Phobia Guru’ warns that as the fear is often learned from parents, it can easily be passed on to a child who can then develop general anxiety disorder.There is also the danger of an arachnophobic being involved in an accident, like a car crash, if a spider appears in front of them while they are occupied with another activity.All of Mr Cox\u0026#39s clients have been able to touch a tarantula or help capture and release a house spider after the session.Mr Cox, who himself used to suffer from a fear of heights and public speaking, also uses his psychological training to help arachnophobes face the creatures in the ‘Spider Courage Experience’.Phobias are more pronounced than fears, and can become overwhelming and affect day-to-day life.Fears and phobiasAn Anxiety UK spokesman said: “Art could play a role in the treatment of spider phobia in that a client with this fear may find it helpful, as part of the graded exposure process, to draw a spider and in doing so, become accustomed and eventually overcome any fear associated with this activity thus enabling them to then move on to the next step, which might be seeing a spider in a jar, for example, placed at the far side of a room.”Please review our commenting policyComment: There are worse vices than McDonald\u0026#39s, but it\u0026#39s an easy target for the pious eliteNASA launches $1 billion ICESat-2 mission to uncover the depth of melting ice sheetsMerkel coalition in crisis once again over intelligence chief as more far-Right protests plannedFrance may have apologied for atrocities in Algeria, but the war still casts a long shadowSailor \u0026#39killed wife and sank catamaran to inherit estate and end marital strife\u0026#39Inside the warring Tory tribes: from the Thinking Brexitettes\u0026#39 Crumpet to the Silent AssassinsFormer British soldier jailed for nearly 8 years in Turkey after being accused of fighting against Islamic StateSweden refuses to deport Palestinian who firebombed a synagogue for fear he will be Israeli targetA gleaming example of how to have your cake and scoff it in one go: why Killing Eve is the best British thriller in yearsComment: What Putin and Corbyn have in common: they\u0026#39ll sacrifice truth for powerWoman killed as stolen lorry crashes into houseFuture of Europe: Why in Emmanuel Macron the EU have their greatest saviour - and biggest liabilityComment: These extremely innocent Russians aren’t the first tourists to be smeared by BritainAggressive goats, with taste for human urine, are airlifted out of parkCarrie Hope Fletcher on bullies, body image and bringing Heathers to the West EndShare your Spitfire memories for The \u0026#39s celebratory project Comment: It\u0026#39s a triumph of the radical Left that only the Dalai Lama is now allowed to speak \u0026#34the truth\u0026#34Quick silver: The life and times of one very special Spitfire Mark IX We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"future europe emmanuel macron eu have greatest saviour biggest","story":"Emmanuel Macron - Europe\u0026#39s lone prizefighter.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”Amal\u0026nbspClooney\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeoffrey Robertson over the Elgin Marbles (Getty)The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

It is brave and it is self aware to realise that more of the same in contemporary British politics isn’t going to cut it.“The bit I don’t like is that it is called this ‘movement for moderation’. Part of the problem is that the centre feels too insipid, too safe, too boring, too politics as usual, when in fact centrist thought, and small ‘l’ liberalism, can give rise to radical ideas that disrupt elites, disrupt closed shops, ideas that can really change things. That is the market in which the Lib Dems should be operating.”Another former Lib Dem staffer thinks it is not only the as yet unlaunched supporters association that will soon be needing a new name. It will be the whole party itself:“All this stuff, having registered supporters, changing the rules so a non MP can be leader, they’re setting it up so that the party can be negotiated away into a new party. You don’t change the rules so that a non-MP can be leader unless you’re thinking about closing the party down.”Becoming the home for the army of radical centrists that must, surely, be out there somewhere, is one thing, but there are more pressing problems which people inside the party have come to think might not be solvable.“There has been polling done to work out whether the party is toxic, and the results suggest it is,” said a former adviser. “The polling company, Populus, one of the seven groups they break the electorate down into is ‘left wing intellectuals.’“They used to be our core vote. ‘Left wing intellectuals’ voted for Charles Kennedy when they didn’t like the centrist Labour party. They were the main swell of support. Those people are gone. When we polled it in February 2017 we were at 10 per cent with them.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union “It means we don’t really know what we are any more. Are we like the German FDP? Sensible, reliable, and an adjunct to government?“Or are we a Charles Kennedy style opposition party that opposes everything?“Kennedy constantly attacked Labour from the left, on civil liberties, on Iraq, on detention without charge. That stuff chimed with the voters we then lost in 2015, and they haven’t come back. They are now enamoured with Corbyn.“That was our base, and the polling shows we have become toxic with them. The party’s soul is with Charles Kennedy, but the future of the party is as an FDP.”The idea of setting up a registered supporters association, which is what ‘Momentum for moderates’ would be, is something that the party has considered doing for years. Tim Farron looked into it even Nick Clegg looked into it. Party insiders suggest Sir Vince now imagines it will be his legacy.But they still fall well short on quite what a Momentum for moderates would do or stand for.\u0026nbsp“If you want to talk about the need of something new in the centre, it can’t be an existing brand,” said one former Lib Dem adviser, who worked for the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, during the years of coalition.“You have seen movements everywhere, whether it’s Macron, Momentum, or the alt right in America, movements that work in conjunction with, alongside, in support of, and parallel to politicians have had success.“But what we need is to be more radical about the platform, the offer to voters.“Look at Labour under Ed Miliband. You’d see people from the left writing a 5,000 word essay in the New Statesman about, ‘Why Labour must have something to say on immigration.’ And everyone agreed, but then they didn’t have anything to say.\u0026nbsp“The problem you might have is that everybody will say, ‘the centre needs to be more radical’, everyone will agree, but then you won’t have any radical ideas or policies.“People need to work out what the big spending measures the party would take are, what new environmental policies.“It might seem very Lib Demmy, but people actually do moan about how parties don’t represent them, about how the voting system is unfair and all that, so that is an area where we could offer change.“There are lots of people in Westminster, in and around politics who, if not sympathetic to the Lib Dems themselves are sympathetic to Lib Dem ideas. There’s environmental charities, people who are interested in the reform of broken systems like tax, or the electoral system.“And it just has got to feel a bit younger, a bit edgier. That is where Momentum has had success. Momentum is viewed as being only young people, but it really isn’t. It’s full of all sorts of people, some of whom have been around for decades, but the way they put themselves across makes people think it’s young and edgy.”Next weekend at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, you can be certain that hundreds if not thousands of the nation’s youth will assemble for an eve of conference rally, fully energised, mobilised and committed to the Corbyn project. But Liberal Democrats do not feel their chance has passed.How the Lib Dems will overhaul the broken immigration systemThe time to form a new centrist party is nowLet non-members vote in Lib Dem leadership contests, Cable saysLib Dem leader Vince Cable denies he is planning to quit partyFormer Lib Dem HQ now palatial £36m Westminster mansion with 10m pool“Not everyone under 25 in Britain is a socialist, or attracted to pretty hard left views,” said one former staffer. “But they do want some kind of significant change, and most of them want no Brexit so there is a market there.Privately, Lib Dems hope that Momentum for moderates might attract 100,000 members. But if the party decides it wants to survive the party will need to change too.“They’ve got to overhaul the party’s processes,” said one ex staffer. “Things like the leader not being able to sack anyone. Lord Rennard is still there because we can’t get rid of him. And the leader can’t set policy, which means they can’t announce policy.“We will see how we get on in the Sunday papers. But if you’re not in power and you can’t announce policy then what have you got to offer the media? They’ll just go to Labour instead.\u0026nbsp“Who will the interviews be with on Sunday, Vince or Keir Starmer? If it’s not Vince then we’re not in the conversation any more.”The Lib Dem fightback has been promised at every party conference since 2015 and, over the coming days, don’t expect 2018 to be any exception. But the starting point gets further away, and the questions more challenging. It will need plenty of momentum, and there is no time for moderation.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/dog-beer.jpg  width= 1966  height= 1474  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/dog-beer.jpg","title":"wetherspoons price rises brexit no deal tim martin","story":"Created with Sketch.Pub chain said it will hike prices rather than cut costs on staff and serviceClick to followThe IndependentWetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for no-deal BrexitJD Wetherspoon has reported a jump in sales in the last year, but warned prices are likely to rise over the coming 12 months.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

They are very resilient and they seem to be full of empathy and intuition around people who might need their support.\u0026nbspToday the family live near Lewes, East Sussex, in a converted chicken shed that they have refurbished into an open-plan house.\u0026nbspZoeli is now 20, Sky is 17 and Levy, 15.\u0026nbspThe children and their parents have their own bedrooms but much of their time is lived around a vast table in the main living space that can seat 20 and was made by a local carpenter.\u0026nbspThe Kalahari (Image: Free Press Image)\u0026ldquoEverything happens around that communal table, says Rolf.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt is where we eat, work and talk.\u0026nbspThe family have their own vegetable garden, rely on solar energy and heat their hot water on a wood-burning stove.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWhen the kids have parties it is so lovely to see that they always move out and end up sitting around the fire making music, says Renata.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt is as if they are still trying to stay as much connected to the natural world as they can.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWinters family and Mark Rylance (Image: Ilona van Genderen Stort\u0026#8232)Interestingly, while her travels have inspired Zoeli to take a degree in anthropology, which she will begin in two weeks\u0026rsquo time, she has chosen to do so at Goldsmiths, University of London.\u0026nbspWe don\u0026rsquot make them feel we expect anything of them, says her mother.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot mind what they become or where they do it.

That is probably more difficult, it is longer and more complicated but it is a more concrete solution.We are growing, and we are allying with other European countries to change the E.U. from within. If we leave, it would be the end of hope.Vivienne Walt, who interviewed Mr Salvini, told France24 afterwards: The whole issue of an exit is over for now. You don\u0026rsquot hear these leaders say that. They are saying, we will change this form within, which is a lot more subversive prospect than bailing out.Salvini pledged to keep Italy inside the EU and change the Brussels-led bloc from within (Image: )Earlier this week, tensions erupted at a behind-closed-doors sesion at a European conference on security and immigration in Vienna.\u0026nbspMr Salvini published a video of a tense exchange between himself and\u0026nbspLuxembourg\u0026rsquos foreign minister\u0026nbspJean Asselborn during a debate on migration.In the footage, Mr Salvini says: In Italy there\u0026rsquos the need to help our kids have kids, not to have new slaves to replace the children we\u0026rsquore not having.Mr Asselborn, who is visibily irritated by the Italian\u0027s remarks, fires back with a French curse: Merde alors!On Tuesday, Mr Salvini lashed out at Brussels for not taking sufficient action to curb Europe\u0027s migration crisis.Speaking to the BBC, he said: Brussels has been promising us help and assistance for years and has been doing nothing.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what kind of cataclysm is so scary that youd move to the middle of nowhere just to avoid it?It could be natural disasters, or someone [the US] ticked off, Rodney says.One of 54-year-old Rodneys biggest fears is that North Korea will attack America with an electromagnetic pulse  weapon.EMPs can be triggered by detonating a nuclear warhead above the Earths surface - creating a burst of radioactive energy which can disable all electrical devices in a huge radius.Well be knocked back 200 years, he says. Everybody should be prepared.If Rome fell, then the US can fall too.As such, Rodney left civilisation to start a new le at the end of the world, along with 11 other family members, hoping to escape Armageddon by cutting themselves off from society and becoming self sufficient.That means living without electricity, running water or any shops for miles around, but for Rodneys family, and an increasing number of people like them, it seems like a small price to pay for guaranteed survival.Fear has driven Rodney and his we, Kaye, to take up arms and teach their family how to shoot - in case their home is ever attacked.Rodney oversees an armoury loaded with guns and even explosives - which the family will turn into landmines to defend their 40-acre property when society falls apart.Kaye, meanwhile, sleeps with a loaded pistol by her bed, and in her wardrobe she keeps a tomahawk - a small axe designed for hand-to-hand combat.In case the worse comes to the worst, she says.The family stockpile isnt just limited to weapons, however.Over the years, Kaye, 55, has also stowed away thousands of tins, jars and boxes of food in a storage shed dedicated to keeping the family fed and watered in an emergency.Jam, canned in 1978, is still resting on the shelf and preserved leftovers are kept in a fridge just in case.The children go to school but, otherwise, most of their time is consumed by the never-ending chores which keep the family going.Twice a week, water has to be fetched from a well on the other side of the compound, and Lakotas mum, Shareena, spends hours every week driving her kids to and from the bus stop where they can catch a ride into the nearest school.Hours every day are also spent preparing food for the ever-growing stockpile, and anything - including reeds from local rivers - can be pickled and put to good use.There is also livestock to feed - pigs, chickens and turkeys - and a pack of over 30 specially bred wolf-dogs to look after.Its a lot of effort, and her prepper lestyle has even cost Kaye her relationship with her dad, who doesnt understand why she is so keen to sacrice so many of her comforts.For others, being prepared means more than just stocking up on guns and tinned food.In South Dakota, you can find a former weapons depot consisting of row upon row of 575 secure, blast-proof concrete bunkers.A growing community of preppers from all over the country are currently in the process of buying them up and converting them into homes to flee to.Suzy has recently bought one of these bunkers with her boyfriend, Mark.The pair are planning to sell their house and move so they can be nearer to their shelter as they do it up - and eventually get married in it.Suzy discovered the bunker complex after watching a YouTube video about the collapse of civilisation.One of the guys at work was telling me about certain cataclysms that may happen, so I started investigating, Suzy says.When the cataclysm happens, people will go crazy - robbing the stores and such. So [the government] will round everyone up.Theyll put them in a camp,  her boyfriend Mark interjects. And youll get a chip in your hand. Now theyve got you.These fears of a domineering post-apocalyptic government are what drove the pair to Vivos X point, the bunker complex dubbed the worlds largest survival community.Up to 5,000 like-minded survivors will be able to fit in the collection of reinforced concrete shelters, and site owner Robert Vicino is trying to sell a chunk of his safe haven to as many preppers as he can.But Suzys decision to up sticks and move into a windowless bunker has caused all sorts of problems with her family.Theyre not on board, she says. They think Im crazy. I think theyre all going to perish.And shes not the only one to fall out with loved ones over a bunker.Milton, a friend of the couple who they met while shopping for a bomb shelter, broke up with his we because she didnt support his decision to buy a £25,000 bunker.Were going through the orce process now, he says. The bunker was the straw that broke the camels back.However, not all preppers are so extreme, and gearing up for the apocalypse doesnt always have to be a chore.One company, Ready To Go Survival, has managed to tap in to a lucrative market of high-earners who want to insure themselves against Armageddon without giving up their home comforts.Founders Roman and Fabian run their business out of Fabians garage, in Austin, Texas.They sell survival gear, like radiation-proof outfits and gas masks, targeted at middle-class professionals concerned that the US might be attacked.Already, theyve sold over 5,000 haz-mat suits - designed to keep you alive in a chemical, biological or nuclear attack and priced at 100  each.They also sell protection kits for dogs, in the form of little bags filled with canine medical essentials which you can strap to your pet.It takes 90 minutes for the average family to pack up and evacuate their home, Roman says. We want to take that down to 90 seconds.Its about prepping for the small stuff. Start with basic necessities and then grow from there.However, as relaxed as Roman may sound, hes still very serious about prepping.Downstairs in the garage, he keeps his motorbike ready to go at all times, and he knows he can escape from the city in mere minutes  he need to.Prepping is already mainstream, business partner Fabian says.

as a new solution to the bitter impasse over how to keep the Irish border open.Mr Raab was also said to have angered No10 by sending Mr Barnier into a rage recently by challenging the EU to impose a hard border in Ireland  there is no deal, as the UK would refuse.Two of the nine backbench Tory MPs at the boozy No10 dinner have told The Sun that the very senior official told them that Mr Raab “has been a fucking nightmare ever since he arrived”.The rising star was promoted into the key Cabinet job in July after David Davis walked out.One of the MPs in the room said: “It was an utterly extraordinary thing for such a senior aide to the Prime Minister to say about a Cabinet minister. We were stunned.“The tension No10 is under trying to make the disastrous Chequers plan work is clearly getting to some of them.”The senior official last night adamantly denied making the comment.But he did admit using sarcasm during the dinner that “could have been wilfully misunderstood”.A No10 spokesman said: “It is 100% nonsense and did not happen”.Sources close to Mr Raab insisted it was “utter rubbish” that he is conspiring with Mr Barnier for a customs border down the Irish Sea, or that he has gone rogue during talks.Mr Raab and Mrs May are in lockstep over her red line not to see the UK ided up in any way by the Brexit deal, the source added.It emerged yesterday that British negotiators have handed Mr Barnier new data about internal UK trade, on his request.The figures give a detailed breakdown of the volume and type of trade in goods that takes place between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Ireland’s ambassador to the EU, Declan Kelleher, said Mr Barnier wants the data to show his version of the backstop won’t create an Irish Sea border.He said: “The backstop in no way changes the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the UK. It’s not a border down the Irish Sea.“Essentially it would involve addressing issues such as technical controls at the ports between Northern Ireland and Great Britain which already exist.“Nothing revolutionary is being proposed here, it’s simply a question of building on what’s already been achieved.”An EU source told The Sun that officials would look at it with a view to seeing whether checks could be moved away from the border or aided by technology.They said: “We can’t de-dramatise it by ourselves. We’re still open to the UK coming with something but as time goes by it looks less likely.”A second source added: “The UK has provided us with some of the data, which we’ll look at together with them.“This data will be helpful to better understand trade flows between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”British negotiators have reportedly given their EU counterparts assurances that they will compromise on the backstop after the Tory party conference.But EU officials are still wary of the fact that any compromise on the border could be torpedoed by eurosceptics.A diplomatic source said: “The real question is what will happen with the domestic dynamics in the UK.“The Tory conference is a huge political risk factor to the final stage of the negotiations.”Mr Raab and Mr Barnier held their weekly talks over the phone yesterday after plans for a face to face meeting were cancelled.The Brexit Secretary said: “While there remain some substantive dferences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have just been telling my family, you can think of all the superlatives in the world and they wouldn’t be enough.“I am so glad I have done it, it’s the perfect dress rehearsal for next year.“Parachuting itself is ever so enthralling.”The retired Salvation Army Officer from Dorset jumped from 10,000 feet at Old Sarum airfield near Salisbury, Wilts.He previously had only jumped from 865 feet during the war.Read was only 20-years-old when he parachuted on June 6, 1944 helping to clear a route for British troops to liberate France from the Nazis.Not long after qualying as a parachutist in 1944 Read was told he would be dropped into the occupied French region to clear a path for the British soldiers coming by boat.However, he and his fellow troops landed in a field flooded by Nazi soldiers after there was confusion about the drop zone.Hundreds of men were never found after parachuting into the River Dives and being sucked into the mud.Read said he vividly remembers D-Day and the “hazardous” mission.He said: “We landed on time, but we were in the wrong place. There was a field and the Germans had deliberately flooded it with water from a nearby river.“When I dropped into the water I wasn’t aware of anyone near me at all. It was quite some time before I linked up with anyone else.“It was quite hazardous, 192 men from one battalion died in the area.

The ­family’s beloved pet dog was also killed by deranged Michael Stone.Josie herself was left with such severe head injuries that medics at she scene thought she was dead before finding a faint pulse.This little girl was a fighter.It must have been horrendous for both of them.Josie couldn’t speak for a year after the attack, had to have an operation to put a titanium plate in her head and her recovery was slow. It was all about small ­victories, and it was down to the tenacity of a little girl who just wanted to live a normal le.Now she is flourishing.Josie has become a successful artist, is engaged to her soul mate Iwan Jones and recently bought the family home in Wales where she spent her early childhood before they all moved to Kent where the attack happened.The house is full of happy memories and Josie dwells on events like her mum bringing home Rosie the pony when she was just five years old and teaching her to ride.Rosie is now a grand old lady of 27 and one of the most ­important things in Josie’s le.The feisty little pony is a link to her mum and little sister and played a massive part in her recovery. Learning how to ride again gave her confidence and a sense of freedom.Josie graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2009 and built up her own art business, first by selling handmade cards at fairs and now producing beautul ­textile landscapes.I’ve met Josie several times over the years, most memorably shortly after the accident when she was still coming to terms with the double tragedy of the death of both her mum and sister.She was shy and wary but gradually I gained her confidence and we spent a lovely afternoon together with her dad Shaun and Rosie the pony.I caught up with her again this week, and I’m always struck by her positivity and her refusal to be thought of as a victim.She very much lives in the moment and always tries to seize the day and be positive.Josie is a walking testament to the power of the human spirit and her mum would be very proud of her beautul, talented, happy daughter.LOTS of speculation already over who will be heading Down Under for I’m A Celebrity in November.Names being bandied around include EastEnder Danny Dyer, Corrie’s Michael Le Vell and former Strictly pro Brendan Cole.GMB’s Kate Garraway is keeping mum about rumours but she would be a hoot, although the person I’d really like to see there is my pal and TV colleague Dr Hilary Jones, who we’ve mocked up in the jungle, pictured.A team player and an action man, he also has a filthy sense of humour, doesn’t suffer fools gladly and would dispense medicine and advice when the insects start to bite and tummies get upset after being fed a diet of ostrich bum.And at the risk of objectying the good doctor, I would pay good money to see him in his skimpies having a shower at the famous waterfall.The ambitious project was first discussed in 2004, when I was rector of Dundee University. It’s wonderful to see it spring to le.Inevitably, costs spiralled. But hopefully the increase in tourism, business and the jobs created will more than offset the £80million price tag.As a proud adopted Dundonian, I want the V\u0026ampA to be a museum for everyone. I hope schoolchildren will enjoy the exhibits, friends will meet there for coffee and everyone in Dundee will think of it as their own.It’s here and I can’t wait to celebrate.IT’S a bit icky – and frankly unbelievable – that Corrie has Jim McDonald pretending his current girlfriend is his dead daughter in order to wreak revenge on his clan.More Game Of Thrones than a game of dominoes down the Rovers... and I can’t take it seriously., so I am. I’ve missed him bellowing “ELIZABETH!” and talking about being in the big house, so I have.I just wish they hadn’t oversensationalised his  because the character is big enough not to need such an OTT comeback.It did get me thinking as to who else I would like to see back in Soapland.And one fab character sprang to mind. I’m sure you recall Emmerdale’s Paul Lambert, who made a huge impact during his five years in the Dales.Paul was played by the ridiculously handsome Mathew Bose, who must have a painting in the attic because he hasn’t aged a day since leaving school.Surely his  is long overdue. His family are still in Emmerdale, including dad Rodney Blackstock, auntie Diane Sugden and his half-sisters. There are lots of layers to Paul, too.His alter-ego is drag queen Thelma Louise, while he and his boyfriend Jonny were the first characters in a primetime drama to have a civil partnership, back in 2008.Surely such an interesting character should be welcomed back to Emmerdale with open arms.We will know more tomorrow night, but I’m spending far more time than is good for me speculating about how it’s all going to be resolved.IT’S been a long time since I considered Jacob Rees-Mogg an amusing anachronism, a bit like a pocket watch.Behind this softly spoken throwback to the Victorian age is a flinty hard-liner who would deny a raped woman the right to an abortion.He’s hell-bent on a rock-hard Brexit, and he doth protest too much about not wanting to be Prime Minister for it to ring true. So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even the Daily Mail mocked them for not having the numbers to bring down Theresa May, a proper candidate to put up against her or a credible Brexit plan. Hence their head-in-hands despair as they realised their cack-handed attempt to convince voters they could turn Britain into some 19th century Little England paradise was doomed. To borrow a trending phrase, they’d wrapped a suicide vest around their project and handed the detonator to any onlooker with half a brain. The thing about these militants from the Rees-Mogg Tendency is they know what they hate – any attempt to harmonise with the EU. But not what they want, apart from a blue passport and Land of Hope and Glory sung at every school assembly.  Now the PR managers from Vote Leave can no longer keep them locked in the cellar like demented relatives, they’ve emerged into the light and been seen for what they truly are. UKIP soulmates with a Tory seat. The “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists” that David Cameron referred to. They’ve talked the EU-hating talk but now it’s time to walk it, they’ve gone lame. That red bus bearing the \u0026pound350million-a-week lie about funding an NHS they would like to dismantle, has driven off. The fog thrown up by Nigel Farage’s cigarette smoke has cleared and they’ve emerged from it like the worst Stars In Their Eyes acts, poor impersonations of serious politicians, exposed as the third-rate charlatans they are. Remainers on the left, like me, admitted the EU was flawed and had some sympathy with people like Dennis Skinner who’ve always seen it as an undemocratic capitalist club.

The plan,  approved by a consultation of members, would allow non-members to vote in leadership elections and allow non-MPs to stand for the party’s leadership. At the party’s annual conference, held this weekend in Brighton, the Lib Dem leader told a members-only meeting: “We are doing well. We’re recovering from a bad period in our party’s history. “But we’re not recovering fast enough, or going far enough.” He said the Lib Dems risked losing ground to newly formed centrist parties unless starts to engage with more people - including young people who share the party’s values, but don’t want to get involved in traditional party activities. “The ground that we occupy will be occupied by other organisations,” he said.   The plan, seen by the Mirror, would create a new “supporter class” in the party, similar to the Labour party ’s “Registered Supporters” - who could pay a lower membership fee in order to vote in leadership elections.  Sir Vince confirmed the rule changes would allow party members who are not MPs to stand to be party leader. And the plan would scrap rules that prevents new members from standing for office until they have been members for at least a year.

The former Royal Bank of Scotland boss was pictured smirking in one of his classic cars – and he has plenty to smile about after it emerged his pension pot is worth \u0026pound17million. He has already raked in \u0026pound6million since quitting in disgrace a decade ago, with a \u0026pound2.8million lump sum. But it is a very dferent story for the millions of ordinary households who are on average \u0026pound23,400 a year worse off thanks to the crash that Goodwin and other gambling bankers caused.  And he seems to be showing little remorse over the 90,000 RBS jobs lost or the billions of pounds forked out by taxpayers to rescue his doomed bank. His clear disregard for those left trailing in the wake of the devastating financial disaster as he enjoys a \u0026pound450,000 a year pension, according to analysis by independent pensions expert John Ralfe, last night sparked fury. Robin Hood Tax campaign director David Hillman said: “Goodwin \u0026shysymbolises the height of \u0026shyunfairness. “After driving his bank into the ground, he walked off with a golden handshake. “No wonder he’s still grinning from ear to ear 10 years later.”  Goodwin was pictured by the Mirror behind the wheel of his \u0026pound12,000 rare 1988 BMW 635CSi with the apt plate 666 – the number of the beast in the Bible. Wearing shades, he drove off from his large house in \u0026shyEdinburgh’s plush Grange area. The BMW is believed to be one of a number of classic cars he owns. He has also been seen driving a convertible Triumph Stag to play 18-hole golf at his golf course at \u0026shyArcherfield in East Lothian, with fees of \u0026pound30,000. The crash happened after Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers dramatically collapsed, sending the world’s financial system into meltdown. Britain’s big banks were plunged into chaos by the \u0026shysubsequent credit crunch, leading to a \u0026pound130billion bailout.  RBS, which had morphed into the world’s biggest bank through a wave of \u0026shyquestionable \u0026shytakeovers, was rescued from the brink of collapse the following month. For those at the wrong end of the \u0026shyfinancial scale, the crash caused nothing but misery as the Government dipped into the public purse to save the banks. Crippling austerity has unleashed anguish on millions of the poorest. And yet no senior banker has been jailed in the UK for the scandal. For many, Goodwin \u0026shypersonies those who \u0026shyprofited from the boom times before the crash and walked away from the mess scot-free. During his eight years in charge, the former accountant turned RBS into the world’s biggest bank by assets, a \u0026pound64billion global Goliath with 200,000 staff. Insiders claim after he was named as Forbes’ Businessman of the Year in 2002 it instilled a “supreme arrogance” in him. One source said he believed he could “walk on water” and added: “He was seen as some kind of banking demigod.”  Critics say Goodwin’s reign was marked by reckless lending and a series of takeovers, including NatWest and the disastrous acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Ambro in 2007. It is claimed RBS paid over the odds and failed to carry out sufficient checks. The bank lavished profits on luxuries such as an \u0026pound18million company jet and a permanent suite at London hotel The Savoy costing \u0026pound700,000 a year. But despite the carnage left behind by the RBS, Goodwin insists he has done nothing wrong. Author Ian Fraser said: “Despite the fact he has been ostracised by the public, he has been accepted by elements of the Scottish establishment. “But then, Fred would expect nothing else. Perhaps the most shocking aspect of the RBS story is that he remains \u0026shyunrepentant and defiant.  “He still believes he wasn’t responsible and blames others. His lack of remorse and humility has been a common trait throughout this whole affair.” An acquaintance of Goodwin’s \u0026shydisagreed, insisting: “He felt deeply wounded by what people said.” In 2012, Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood, which had been handed to him by Tony Blair. He was also reportedly turfed out of the family home by we Joyce after she \u0026shydiscovered he was having an affair with a colleague. The couple, who have two children, orced in 2016. The \u0026shyFinancial Services Authority, cleared Goodwin of any \u0026shywrongdoing over the collapse of RBS. But he is being sued for up to \u0026pound3billion by Taiwanese \u0026shyshipping magnate Nobu Su, the billionaire chairman of Today Makes Tomorrow. He accuses Goodwin, along with two former colleagues and the bank, of “hijacking” TMT’s accounts and using them as “unlimited cash machines”. It is believed to be one of the biggest lawsuits ever against a UK inidual. As Goodwin continues his high le today, Shadow \u0026shyChancellor John McDonnell is due to address a rally organised by the coalition 10 Years On outside the Bank of England.  He will say: “One of the key lessons to be learnt from the crash is that never again must we allow finance to become the master of the economy, rather than its servant.” A campaigning pensioner is fighting for thousands of people who lost money in the fall of Northern Rock. Dennis Grainger, 72, said the Government is making \u0026pound9.6billion profit on the \u0026pound37billion used to bail out the Newcastle-based bank. But he added: “They are saying that is going to keep the profits to offset the losses they made on RBS and other banks.” Crash fatcats who went on to get fatter Adam Applegarth Under him Northern Rock was transformed from a sleepy Newcastle building society into the UK’s fth biggest mortgage lender. But risky policies, including 125% Together mortgages, were its undoing. Fears for its future led to customers queueing outside branches to get their money out. Applegarth, paid \u0026pound10million in the five years before it collapsed, sauntered away with a \u0026pound760,000 pay-off. In 2009, he began advising US private equity firm Apollo Management.

A new \u0027uglier\u0027 crisis is around the corner Analysis by Richard Murphy , Professor of Practice in International Political Economy at City, University of London ON September 15, 2008, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial crisis began. Ten years later, that situation has not really ended. Worse, many economists — me included — think a new crisis may be around the corner. So what happened, why, and what might happen next time? Lehman crashed because it had run out of money. Within weeks, the crisis had spread. In October 2008, then Chancellor Alistair Darling was told Royal Bank of Scotland was just hours away from also running out of cash. And RBS going down was not an option.  Lehman Brothers was not a high street bank, RBS was. So too were Lloyds, HBOS and Bradford \u0026amp Bingley. All were heading the same way as Northern Rock, which had collapsed a year earlier. Mr Darling could let the banks fail — as the US had let Lehman Brothers fail — or bail them out. But the truth was that he had no choice. If RBS went down, millions of people in the UK would have had no access to money. And that might also have been true of hundreds of thousands of businesses. If a bank like RBS failed, it was likely others would go down. On average most British households have no more than three days food in stock. People and supermarkets without banks would have meant panic and food riots. So Mr Darling bailed out the banks, as any responsible Chancellor would have done. But most of us have been paying for that ever since. Between 1998 and March 2008, the Government borrowed \u0026pound186billion to keep the economy going. From April 2008 to March 2018, the Government borrowed \u0026pound990billion. The dference is, roughly, \u0026pound25,000 a household. You paid through austerity. Only two groups were protected. One was pensioners. And I cannot argue with that. The other group was bankers. And that was just wrong.

The horric footage shows a lorry smashing into a row of parked cars while the driver peers down at his mobile phone while on the motorway. Lorry driver Tomasz Kroker had been changing the music on his phone when he ploughed into stationary traffic in 2015. He killed Tracy Houghton, 45, and her sons Ethan, 13, and Joshua, 11, as well as her partner\u0027s daughter, Aimee Goldsmith, 11.   Surrey Police released the distressing footage in a bid to stop drivers using their phones at the wheel, Get Surrey reports.  Josh and Ethan\u0027s dad, Doug, said the youngsters had been planning on playing Pokemon Go in Hyde Park when they got back from their holiday. He said: I thought that was the worst day of my le, my kids being killed. But I think it was three weeks later when I went to the funeral director\u0027s and actually saw them, dead, cold, in their coffins. Aimee\u0027s dad, Mark, said the children couldn\u0027t wait to get home to play Pokemon and said they hugged and kissed before getting into the car. In the video clip, Aimee\u0027s mum, Kate, recalled in tears how the police had knocked on her door and told her her daughter had been killed in a car accident.  I continue to see drivers using their phones and it sickens me, she said. If they had seen the devastation they brought my family, or to other families, by using phones, illegally... distracting themselves from driving a potential weapon... Would they be as sickened as we are?

The driver - and others who tried to get out of the queue - was branded selfish and idiotic by a lorry driver who recorded video of the scene in Cheshire.  Dozens of drivers were stuck on the M6 after five vehicles collided and one transporting cows overturned, forcing police to close the motorway, the Manchester Evening News reports.  But it appeared a number of motorists became impatient and decided to avoid the wait by turning around and driving in the direction of oncoming traffic.  Mobile phone footage shot by the lorry driver, who asked to remain anonymous, shows him berating the motorist, who then decided to re-join the queue. Traffic had been brought to a standstill after a five-vehicle crash near junction 21A of the southbound carriageway of the M6, the Croft Interchange shortly before 11am on Thursday. One of the vehicles was towing a trailer containing a number of cows. No motorist or animals were harmed.  However given the nature of the incident recovery of the vehicles took a while, with traffic being halted for a time and delays lasting several hours. The HGV driver who shot the footage says he could not believe someone was using the hard shoulder to try and get off the motorway in the wrong direction when the emergency services needed access to the crash scene. The 52 year-old from Eccles said: I just couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. As a lorry driver you see some stupid things on the roads but this was another level.

Dr Chris Busby, 73, was arrested and held for 19 hours under the Explosives Act before being released after neighbours reported his 29-year-old housemate was acting strangely. Devon and Cornwall Police arrived at his address on Bridge Street in Bideford, Devon, with fire engines, ambulances, hazardous materials vehicles and an explosives van all swarming the area.  Dr Busby is a regular expert for Russian state channel RT and has previously claimed Britain may be behind the Salisbury poisoning, reports Devon Live .  He was questioned by police, who suspected him of making a bomb but all that was found at his home were innocuous chemicals for research into radiation.  Dr Busby is one of the experts used by the Kremlin-backed Russia Today news channel, which yesterday broadcast an interview with the two suspected novichok hitmen Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. The scientist has previously accused the U.S of using depleted uranium weapons in Iraq causing cancer and birth defects.  He has also appeared in YouTube videos blaming the assassination plot to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with the nerve agent Novichok as a \u0027false flag\u0027 operation.   Dr Busby believes the pair were really targeted by Britain or the U.S, who he has accused of trying to frame Russia because they fear President Vladimir Putin is beginning to break up the American monopoly on oil.  In one video he says: \u0027Just to make it perfectly clear, there\u0027s no way that there\u0027s any proof that the material that poisoned the Skripals came from Russia.\u0027  After searching the house, Devon and Cornwall Police said a number of items were found which required expert analysis and also reported officers feeling unwell and subsequently being evacuated from the property. Concerned about the situation and the well being of his house mate, Dr Busby made the five hour drive back from Wales, where he was mending his yacht, to his daughter\u0027s home in Great Torrington. But around 11pm on Wednesday night, there was a knock on the door. Dr Busby said: Two policemen came in and said \u0027we\u0027re arresting you under the explosives act 1883\u0027. They handcuffed me, marched me off to the car and drove me to Barnstaple police station where they slung me into a cell.  They said that they\u0027d found chemicals that you could put together to make a bomb. I told them I\u0027m a scientist - it\u0027s even written above my front door - so you might imagine I have chemicals in relation to what it is I do. Inside his home, a former pub, is a makesht laboratory containing chemicals from Dr Busby\u0027s former rented lab in Wales. Dr Busby said he purchased the chemicals from a colleague who was retiring. He said: We\u0027re talking mostly about chemical associated with working on living systems. Somewhere or another there\u0027s a bottle of nitric acid which they said is capable of making a bomb, which no doubt it is.  If you know what you\u0027re doing you can make a bomb out of more or less anything. You can detonate that  you have a detonator, but I don\u0027t have a detonator. In regards to the claims of police officers feeling unwell within the property, he said he had no idea how that happened. He said: I think it was hysteria - what with the Skripalls and novichok and all that nonsense, they thought that the Russians had come...and thought \u0027oh my god, I\u0027m going to die\u0027. But it was probably just a panic attack. Dr Busby believes that due to his work on nuclear science, which he believes is a threat to the nuclear industry and military, that the search of his property was an attempt to damage his reputation.  He says the police entered his property without a warrant and has asked the police for the full log details of the incident. He added: I want to see all the data on this. I want to see who phoned in, what they said, what you did. I want to know who decided to break into my house without a warrant and what evidence they had to do that. Dr Busby was released from police custody at about 6pm yesterday evening. Around the same time, Devon and Cornwall Police issued a statement explaining that no further action would be taken on the matter.  The statement said: Police have confirmed that enquiries taking place at a property in Bideford are not being treated as criminal, but as a matter of public safety. One man was arrested under the explosives act but has since been released with no further action being taken. Police were called at around 11.30am on Wednesday 12 September following concerns for the welfare of a woman in Bideford. Initial enquiries led officers to attend an address in Bridge Street, Bideford.  Whilst at the address, some of our officers complained of feeling unwell and were immediately removed from the scene and a cordon put in place. The ambulance Hazardous Area Response Team  attended and treated these officers, all of whom are unharmed and have since ed to duty. Following searches within the property, a number of items were found which required expert analysis from specialist officers and an Explosive Ordnance Disposal  team.

The bizarre club sees people uploading photos of themselves - and the only real rule is that there is a lamp in the picture. It has sparked a big online debate with many questioning whether they would be upset  their partner was posting or commenting on the risqu\u0026eacute pictures.  Plymouth Live\u0027s Katie Timms took a look into the world of the lamp lovers, read her article in full below.  Katie\u0027s findings Before I start, I just want to say I am not a serious member of this group - to any relatives of mine who read Plymouth Live, it\u0027s okay, we don\u0027t need to have \u0027a talk\u0027 about this.  The hottest topic on social media at the moment is a raunchy Facebook group iding hundreds of people. However, it\u0027s pretty secretive and most of us will never get access to it.    As a journalist, naturally I felt the need to investigate the page after reading about it on Plymouth Gossip Girls .  The now deleted post on the popular lamp-and-other-things-loving page, which received around 1,000 comments, saw half of the women claim they would be furious  their spouse was a member, while the other half thought it was a bit of fun. The group sees thousands of explicit pictures uploaded to the page. The only catch is that a lamp has to be visible in the image. While the original group is invite only, I stumbled across a \u0027private\u0027 spin-off group that everyone can request to join, which is pretty much the same thing and has almost 20,000 members.  Upon joining the group, named Lamp Lovers [heart] Cameltoe , I glimpsed hundreds of filthy pictures and comments which I will now have to attempt to bleach from my mind.  The more I scrolled the worse the pictures got. There were bare breasts, crotch shots and a lot of bums, with even raunchier comments. Occasionally there would be a picture of a man holding a lamp, fully clothed and smiling, but somehow I felt like that wasn\u0027t what the main aim of this group was for. People appreciate these pictures anyway. The group description invites people of all shapes, sizes, and genders to upload pictures and states that everybody\u0027s shape and size is encouraged to be shown.

The Duchess, 36, has been made a patron of ious organisations, including Action For Children and the East Anglian Children\u0027s Hospices, but had yet to step out and launch her own solo charity project.  But according to a royal source, all that is about to change as Kate prepares to launch her very first charity campaign without the help of her other family members .    The source told The Daily Mail that the campaign will be focused on helping disadvantaged children who have been failed by \u0027broken Britain\u0027.  In order to achieve this Kate will work with experts in fields such as health, education and academia to help families tackle issues such as addiction, anti-social behaviour and mental health. She will avoid using public policy, but instead wield her convening power to bring together these experts under the Royal Foundation to discover why vulnerable families are not getting the help they need.     Their findings will be published by Kensington Palace in the new year.  The campaign is set to be a lelong project for the Duchess, who reportedly wants to be able to look back over the next five, 10, 15 and 20 years and see what dference she has made. Kate is said to have privately acknowledged that critics are likely to question what she, as an incredibly privileged young woman, could possibly know about poverty.  However she is adamant that it is her duty to use her position to look at issues which affect the nation on a long-term basis. In the past she has often spoken out about the importance of helping vulnerable children. Earlier this year, she gave an impassioned speech in which she spoke about breaking the inter-generational cycle of disadvantage. She said: We all know how important childhood is, and how the early years shape us for le.

The MP she said she felt mixed emotions as she received the Jo Cox Award at the No2H8 Crime Awards, backed by the Daily Mirror. Ms Berger, 37, told of her pride at her relentless battle being recognised, but also the poignancy of the award being in memory of her murdered friend and colleague. The Liverpool Wavertree MP said: “I feel honoured to receive the award, but at the same time wish it didn’t exist.”  She added of the awards ceremony, in Central London on Thursday night: “It was inspiring to hear so many stories of people across our country stand\u0026shy\u0026shying up to counter hate and promote tolerance.” Ms Berger is Jewish and has taken a strong stance against anti-Semitism, and in April won a standing ovation in the House of Commons.

Kelly Sibbick, from Cleethorpes was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u0027s disease just a year after her sister Mandy Wilkins passed away from the disease aged just 43.  Kelly\u0027s family say that they are heartbroken by the news, although they always feared that there was a risk she may develop the debilitating condition as relatives have a long history of developing the disease at a very early age. They have already lost four family members before the age of 45 to Alzheimer\u0027s Kelly\u0027s mother, her auntie, her cousin and her sister Mandy. Kelly\u0027s daughter Jamie-Lee Sibbick said that the news has hit the family hard, but had also helped to pull them together to provide Kelly with as much support as possible.  Jamie-Lee said: When we found out that mum was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u0027s disease it was really hard on us all, but something that we were sort of expecting, as we had been picking up on dferent things in the weeks prior, such as her being more forgetful. We know how the disease can affect you, having gone through all of this before with many of our family members, including our mum\u0027s sister Mandy, who passed away just last year. Our plan is to just rally around her as much as we can, so that we can support her and keep le as normal as possible. With my Aunt Mandy, she deteriorated at a very rapid pace, but we are hoping that now that mum has the medication that she needs, things won\u0027t be as severe and we can keep her at home for as long as possible. Mandy was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 37, and despite clinical trials in a bid to combat the condition, passed away in September last year with her family by her side. Kelly has a five-year-old daughter Evie, who has been finding it very hard to understand what has happened to her mum. Her family say they are hoping that over time she will eventually come to terms with her mum\u0027s condition. Jamie-Lee continued: It is nearly impossible to explain to my little sister what is happening with mum. I mean how do you tell a five year old that their mother has dementia? Because she doesn\u0027t understand she keeps saying things to mum like \u0027your so forgetful\u0027 and wondering while she forgets to do things, but in a way I think that kind of helps, because mum just wants to be treated the same as she always has and that is what Evie will do. Her sister Jodie Wilkins, who works as a carer and has a lot of experience dealing with people with Alzheimer\u0027s disease, says that she fears the worst, but with her families experience, feels that they can make things as easy as possible for her. She said: The best thing for us to do is to keep Kelly\u0027s mind focused and carry on with le like we normally would.

Emma Murray had hoped to get her three-year-old into the same establishment that his 14 cousins attended.  She told Belfast Live : It\u0027s not the closest, but I have 14 nieces and nephews that have gone to Bunscoil Bheann Mhadagain, and some to Colaiste Feirste in West Belfast.  That\u0027s the reason I put him down - because he would have been the only one in the family that didn\u0027t attend it. Despite hand delivering her application while at the school collecting nieces and nephews, the part-time classroom assistant said little R\u0026uacutea was refused a place. And a subsequent appeal did not help either.  The 30-year-old said: I have done nothing but cry my eyes out over it. They sent me an email after the tribunal to say they are standing by their decision, that he didn\u0027t get it. It\u0027s basically because I am not falling into social disadvantage criteria and they told me that. I am a single parent and said \u0027I do fall into that category\u0027, they said \u0027you don\u0027t because you are a single parent that works\u0027. It makes me feel angry and like I should quit my job, because  I quit my job, I\u0027ll get everything else handed to me and my child would have got a place in nursery. They said in the tribunal he would have got a place  I didn\u0027t work. The New Lodge woman said she works 24-hours a week as a classroom assistant for the Education Authority at Trinity College on the Antrim Road. But someone has to look after her son while she\u0027s there, so she pays \u0026pound150 a week for daycare.  She added: I work 24 hours a week and earn at most \u0026pound700 a month. It\u0027s not a big income. I do get some help from tax credits. I struggle in day-to-day le, but I don\u0027t want to not work. Emma said the huge saving a nursery place would make her is not the only reason she wants a place for R\u0026uacutea. He\u0027s three years and eight months which means he\u0027s ready for primary school next year and will miss out on a year of nursery, she added. I have him in a daycare at the minute. I worked in one for 11 years and a daycare and nursery are completely dferent. When he goes to primary one, he\u0027s going to be behind and disadvantaged. He\u0027s going to have no structure. I can only teach him so much in the house. R\u0026uacutea\u0027s rejection from the naiscoil has left Emma feeling really disheartened because her family has always supported the Irish language school. It\u0027s just a kick in the teeth when you are told you can\u0027t have a place because you work, she added. Emma said the closest two nurseries to her home are New Lodge and the naiscoil - and that she is in the catchment area for both. But neither have a place for R\u0026uacutea.

Serena Fowkes says there is absolutely nothing wrong with her 13-year-old son Ryan Wild\u0027s hairstyle, which is shaved along the sides and slicked up.  She claims the way her son was treated by Hall Park Academy, in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, was disgusting and a form of bullying.

The writer, who is well known for penning the Oscar-award winning movie The Queen, has accused Tony Blair of lting lines from the 2006 movie and using them in his autobiography, My Journey. The book was published five years after the release of the film and Morgan, 55, has subsequently suggested Mr Blair\u0027s memory of the time had sort of become blurred with the movie.  The Queen starred Helen Mirren as Britain\u0027s monarch , dealing with the aftermath of the tragic death of Princess Diana . Michael Sheen starred alongside her, stepping into the shoes of former prime minister, Tony Blair. Morgan, who has earned a total of 13 Emmy nominations for his work on Netlix royal show The Crown , revealed all during a recent interview on US radio, reports The  . He said: There came a moment after the film that I wrote, The Queen, had come out where Tony Blair was asked about his audience with the Queen.  And in his book, his autobiography, which, of course, came out many years after we made The Queen, Tony Blair, when referring back to that critical period in the aftermath of Diana\u0027s death, used a number of expressions and quotations that seemed to me to be very familiar because they sounded like my dialogue. And I remember thinking \u0027Well hang on a minute. That can\u0027t be right\u0027 He added: I mean, I think we were all pretty confident we knew what Tony Blair represented. We knew what the Queen thought. But surely he didn\u0027t say the very things I\u0027ve written [in the script] that he\u0027d said.  Morgan then telephoned his colleagues to check whether they had read Blair\u0027s autobiography and whether they thought his words sounded like the scene from the film. He described the situation as being both funny and sobering It\u0027s both funny but also sobering because you suddenly realise that, once you watch something on film, it becomes that thing. It becomes the way it was. And so much of what I write can\u0027t be exactly the way it was because I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m just guessing. And then for Blair, in this particular instance, to have taken those imaginations or guesses and to reconstruct them as the truth was confusing in his account.

Mrs Whitmore, who is teetotal, posed for photographs with her husband, the teapot and a glass of champagne for Mr Whitmore - though he usually prefers Tetleys bitter. She said: The teapot is a family heirloom. It was Frank\u0027s great-great-grandmother\u0027s. We kept it on top of the pine unit on a shelf. It\u0027s sacred to us, our little teapot.

His mother Maria Riselli , decided to store the ticket in a glass jar where she could see it was still safe every time she walked past it. Mr Riselli, 50, from Gloucester, scooped \u0026pound24,501,283 in the must-be-won Lotto after the jackpot rolled down to those who had matched five numbers and the bonus ball. He trusted to his mother when it came to the important task of looking after the ticket while he waited for Camelot’s offices to re-open after the Christmas break to confirm the scoop.

Hidden in living room cabinet - but they did not know they had won  A group of NHS hospital catering staff from Port Talbot won \u0026pound25m on the Euromillions in November last year. The syndicate all took early retirement - but they didn\u0027t know they had won when the draw was made. Ultra-organised syndicate leader Julie Saunders, 56, asked her husband to go and buy the ticket on Friday as they were all working. The day after the draw they were visiting her father in a residential home and he told her just one ticket had won the jackpot. She said ‘it could be us as we haven’t checked yet’ – little did she know the ticket hidden in the usual spot in her living room cabinet was the winner. Julie went home and checked the numbers and called Camelot straight away before letting the other members know of their amazing win.  Read the story here.  5. Hidden in we\u0027s underwear drawer  Melvynn Wright hid his winning ticket in his we\u0027s underwear drawer - and splashed out the cash on a new mobility scooter for her. Melvynn we Anne and their four daughters scooped a le-changing \u0026pound1 million after their numbers came up on their syndicate ticket. The 74-year-old revealed he was so scared he would misplace the ticket before Camelot veried the victory, that he stashed it away among Anne’s undergarments.  Retired transport manager Melvynn, from Madeley, told the Stoke Sentinel : “I checked the numbers and they just jumped out at me.  I went to my we and told her come down and check them again. “I always said I would win one day. I just had to keep the faith.  Read the story here.  6. Hidden in a lantern while they went on holiday  Alison and John Doherty won almost \u0026pound15m on the National Lottery in July 2016. The couple, from Elderslie in Renfrewshire, Scotland, discovered they had won but still headed off for a pre-booked family holiday to Florida the next day. They kept their winning ticket hidden in a lantern while they were abroad. She said: He  made me get on the phone to Camelot straight away. Waiting for the winner adviser to call me back was the longest hour of my le. When they did I was screaming again when the phone rang. She added: I put the original ticket inside a hurricane lantern candle holder I have in my bedroom. I also made a photocopy and hid that in the box that John keeps his work boots in, just in case. I wasn\u0027t taking any chances. 7. Hidden in car glove box for a month The winner of a €4.4 million lotto jackpot prize kept the precious ticket hidden in the glove compartment of their car for a MONTH. The delighted punter, from Donegal, who remained anonymous, finally collected a massive cheque at Lotto HQ in Dublin on Thursday. The golden ticket was purchased for the draw on Saturday, January 13. Speaking at Lotto HQ, the winner explained: “I keep all my Lotto tickets in the glove box. “Once I found out I won I stored the ticket in the glove box of the car during the day while I was at work. “But I took the ticket into the house at night time. That piece of paper has clocked up some mileage over the past month.” 8. In her handbag for a week  Donna Stickley walked around with a lottery ticket - worth \u0026pound21m - in her handbag for a week before she and her husband realised they had won the jackpot. After checking the ticket during a shopping trip in Slough a week after buying it Mrs Stickley discovered they had won some money when she was told to call Camelot as the shop couldn\u0027t pay out prizes over \u0026pound500. Mrs Stickley, who works at engineering firm MacGregor Industries Limited as an office manager, says she will use the winnings to buy a new handbag - and get the old one framed. 9.

Helene began off Cape Verde but has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it makes its way east. The storm could bring gale force winds, sending debris flying, disrupting travel and cutting power to thousands of homes and businesses.  The Met Office said: Storm Helene is expected to push north-east towards the UK late Monday, before clearing quickly to the north of Scotland through Tuesday morning. There remains large uncertainty in Helene\u0027s exact track, however a spell of very strong winds is expected, initially for parts of south-west England and west Wales, then later south-west Scotland and the south-east of Northern Ireland.  Winds are likely to gust to 55-65 mph quite widely in the warning area, with possible gusts of 70-80 mph in exposure. It said the dangers are:  Injuries and danger to le from flying debris are possible. Road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible.

Ex-hurricane Helene and newly-formed Joyce are predicted to bring 80mph gales, torrential downpours, flying debris and floods next week. A \u0027danger to le\u0027 warning has been issued across swathes of the UK with fears roads, airports and other transport networks will be thrown into chaos. But the \u0027tropical\u0027 nature of the storms will also see the mercury possibly hit as high as 30C after the weekend, according to forecasters.  The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for wind across north-west and south-west England, Scotland and Wales from Monday night until Tuesday lunchtime. However the systems have not officially been named as \u0027storms\u0027 yet by the forecaster. Spokesman Grahame Madge said the level-one yellow alert may be upgraded depending on the path and severity of the storm. He said: “The UK’s weather will come under the influence of ex-hurricane Helene although there are other systems in the Atlantic which may mody this particular one. “There is a warning out from Monday night with Helene expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain mainly across western Britain through Tuesday morning.  “We expect to see winds of 80mph in the worst affected regions, however across eastern Britain it may just be blustery and otherwise warm with some fine weather. “At the moment we are on a yellow warning but we will continue to monitor the situation and things may change due to the uncertainty of how this will pan out.” Helene began off Cape Verde but has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it makes its way east.

On Friday morning, Tropical Storm Helene was bearing down on the Azores Islands in the Atlantic. The government of Portugal had issued a tropical storm warning for the archipelago.   The US National Hurricane Center said: A turn toward the northeast is expected over the weekend. On the forecast track, Helene will pass near or over the Azores late Saturday or Sunday. Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph  with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48 hours. Gradual weakening is expected after Helene becomes a post-tropical cyclone over the weekend. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles  from the centre.   The warnings were issued as Hurricane Florence wreaked havoc on the US East Coast, flooding homes with a 10ft storm surge.  An Environment Agency spokeswoman said: “Environment Agency staff will monitor the situation, working closely with the Met Office. “We encourage the public to take care by the coast when there are storms and high winds forecast.” AccuWeather meteorologist Renee Duff warned Helene could be the first in a barrage of storms to hit the UK through the second half of the month.

We\u0027re given tips to combat this - turn off smartphones at night, don\u0027t watch television before bed and avoid caffeine late in the day.  But it turns out that the nation is actually enjoying 43 minutes more shut-eye than we did four decades ago. Scientists say our sleep rose from seven hours and 23 minutes to eight hours and six minutes in 2015. It means most adults go to bed half an hour earlier than in 1974 and get up almost 15 minutes later.  This follows a major report in 2016 warning that sleep deprivation was costing the economy \u0026pound40billion a year and raising the risk of premature death by 13 per cent. Experts from the University of Oxford compared data from the 1970s and today, showing their time in bed asleep and awake. They calculated sleeping time by looking at results from studies involving thousands of people, showing how long they spent asleep and awake. The results showed a signicant increase in the amount of night rest which most people enjoyed. However the unemployed saw the biggest rise, sleeping an extra hour than they did in 1970.  Those in work slept around 45 minutes longer and the retired around 27 minutes more, but there was no major dference between men and women. In the Journal of Sleep Research, they said: There is a view that sleep has declined over recent decades and that sleep deprivation has reached epidemic levels and this has led to public concern. But our analysis shows sleep has increased in the UK over the last four decades by more than 40 minutes on average. This could mean because a number of people work from home, giving them the chance to have more time in bed. Another theory is that we spend more time in bed watching TV or using computers so may be more likely to nod off earlier.

But Zasha Whiteway-Wilkinson, 24, left was stunned and felt like she was drowning when a doctor told her that she was seven months pregnant. She had put on about 1.5 stone  over six weeks, but put her weight gain down to her lestyle.  Zasha told Gloucestershire Live that she had been eating absolute garbage after moving home and she had joked to her dad feel my stomach, it\u0027s proper turning over the day she found out she would become a mum.   Within hours, however, Zasha, of Cheltenham, was told that her stomach troubles were actually a baby in her womb and she would give birth in two months.  Here, Zasha tells her story about her weight gain, the moment she found out she was pregnant and what le has been like after giving birth to a son, Isaac, and becoming a mother.     You hear about all the time about women who had no idea they were pregnant and always wonder How didn\u0027t they know?. I thought the same, until it happened to me. I once had a friend whose mum did not know she was pregnant until her labour day... with twins! It made national news , and the first thing anyone would ask is How didn\u0027t she know?. My story is not quite as dramatic, but for me finding out I was pregnant at seven months was dramatic enough to blow up my whole world.  I first discovered I was pregnant almost a month after my 21st birthday on July 7, 2015. I had recently accepted a job as an admin assistant at an engineering company in Hereford, where I lived at the time. I had also recently finished university, achieving an undergraduate degree in journalism from the University of Gloucestershire, which I thought I would never be able to use when I found out. At around four or five months pregnant I crashed my car - came over a hill too quickly in the rain, spun out and drove straight into a 40mph sign. I spent the next couple of months repairing said car completely unaware of the possible stress I could be causing to the fetus taking shelter in my stomach.  Feel my stomach! It\u0027s proper turning over!   Being the responsible adult I aspired to be, excited about the opportunities I would gain now I had this fancy new office job - I booked myself an appointment at my local doctors\u0027 surgery to ensure I was healthy for my new grown up le. I remember every minute detail of that day like it was yesterday. I had been joking around with my dad that morning about having had stomach troubles, Dad, feel my stomach, it\u0027s proper turning over!, before heading over to Hereford County for my check up. Obviously the doctor asked all the usual questions, Could you pregnant?. I said: No way I\u0027ve not been with anyone in over four months. And I\u0027ve had the contraceptive injection since January anyway. I\u0027d put on about 1.5 stone in about six weeks, but had been eating absolute garbage since I\u0027d moved back home. She came back into the office with a very serious look and I thought Oh God, I\u0027ve got an STI, gross. My very own Gabriel, this blond, middle aged doctor delivering the news that would change everything, waved this blue test in my face and said It\u0027s positive. I\u0027m certain. It came up in seconds. Cue silence as I looked at her waiting for her to tell me I had some gross incurable disease.  What we need to talk about now, is whether you\u0027re going to go forward with it - or put a stop to it, she said. Go forward with it? What was she on about? Why would I go forward with some gross disease? Sorry? What\u0027s positive? Your pregnancy test. It came up instantly. I felt my breath quicken, as I felt my heart go into my throat, I felt like I was drowning. There was absolutely no way I could be pregnant, I\u0027d been careful, I was on contraception and I hadn\u0027t had a partner in months anyway. She asked  I was okay and to be honest, no I bloody well wasn\u0027t. I\u0027d just been offered a great new job - how could this be happening to me?! My hands trembling I said I was going to call my dad, he had barely picked up when bless his soul, his 21-year-old daughter began hyper-ventilating through muffled sobs as she broke the news that she\u0027d become just another statistic. Asking me  he should come home I breathed out a confirmation, my whole world was crumbling and I wanted my dad. What were my options?  A part of this story, , is that as I\u0027d been a student throughout most of my pregnancy I had hardly been looking after myself. I\u0027d been drinking , eating absolute garbage , and on a fairly low but not insignicant 10 a day smoking habit. Anyway, as much as I\u0027d like to pretend I\u0027m a model, respectable person - this sort of behaviour pattern doesn\u0027t stop overnight.  So the first thing I did after leaving that doctors office , was smoke a full pack of 20 and devour three bags of pork crackling. will have it known that after that pack of smokes I quit cold turkey for two years .   I met my dad in Costa coffee in The Old Market shopping centre in Hereford and sipped my way slowly through an orange slushy thing. Uncontrollably crying into my drink as we talked through my options. At the time I still thought abortion might be an option as I just about hit that three and a half month cut off, but the idea of doing that to something which as referenced in the cult classic film Juno, had fingernails, would bring another stream of tears rushing out.  Adoption was never really an option for me due to personal family circumstances - it just wasn\u0027t something I was comfortable with and my family made clear from the beginning that  I were to go down that route they would want to adopt the child themselves. I had absolutely zero desire to recreate an EastEnders plot line, so I plugged that train of thought immediately. This rationale left with me with only one option. I was going to have a baby. It was like a snowball effect, except the snowball was on fire  Fast forwarding, I\u0027d come to the assumption that I was three months pregnant, no more than four. So when I saw my GP that day he had a feel around my stomach and offered up his professional opinion as 15 weeks , which although terrying was not altogether unsurprising. It did eliminate any hopes I may have had of terminating the pregnancy however.  He told me that the next step was to arrange a \u0027dating scan\u0027, this and a blood test would also tell me whether the fetus had downs syndrome or spina bida - which I could not comprehend how this was now a worry for me when only that morning I\u0027d thought I might just have a simple case of norovirus .  There seemed to be no urgency from anyone to help me arrange this scan, I spent many hours on the phone and no-one seemed to care. I\u0027d literally just spent my 21st birthday at Harry Potter World! I didn\u0027t have any idea what I was doing! It was only when as a passing comment to a lovely lady on the NHS antenatal helpline, that this fetus was doing flips in my podgy stomach that they seemed to perk up a bit. They said that the baby would only be moving noticeably  I was 21+ weeks gestation. There goes another month and half. She booked me in for the following Monday, it was currently Friday.  Manic Monday   Monday came and I lay on the bed as the midwe slathered my chubby tummy in the blue goo. Looking at that scan made the whole surreal experience very, very real. There was my baby, my unwanted, unexpected, unbelievable little human baby. She said that I was too far gone to date accurately, but she put the date somewhere in the region of 27.5 weeks gestation. Just like that I\u0027d lost another month and a half - this was absolutely ridiculous, I felt that I might as well have just dropped then! This calculation meant that date of contraception was bang on January 12, 2015 , and it was anything else it was closer to Christmas, but I knew this was an impossibilty. What this means of course is that when I\u0027d been tested in January before I got on contraception, I\u0027d had a false negative pregnancy test and got straight onto the injection thinking I\u0027d be protected, when in reality I was already pregnant. This date was set though, this is what they were going to base their dates on for the future, they believed I\u0027d give birth on October 3, 2015. Due date  The run up to the due date was manic. In a perpetual state of panic I set about redecorating my childhood bedroom to cater for both me and my imminent little le. The closer I got to my due date, obviously the bigger I got. But to the untrained eye I just looked like a big girl, I was about 13.9 stone by nine months pregnant . It became an effort to climb up the stairs, but hiding my pregnancy was still easy, I began to wear pure stretchy fabrics leggings, bulky t-shirts, massive hoodies etc. I wasn\u0027t ashamed of my baby, but I didn\u0027t want anyone to say anything that would hurt me when I was already feeling so vulnerable. My due date came and went and I was booked in for an induction on October 15, 2015. I didn\u0027t know anything about induction but I did know I wanted to meet my baby. I never bothered finding out the sex, I didn\u0027t care and figured what was the point - I\u0027d find out in two months anyway! The induction process involved an on-call midwe inserting a pessary and gel into the vagina, they did this twice over six hour periods. Once they had done this they strapped me up to this heart rate monitor, .  I haven\u0027t heard many happy birth stories, so I don\u0027t like to say mine was bad or particularly dficult - How can you measure one person\u0027s pain on another? Shortly after the second pessary, I started bleeding and I started being sick. Sick enough that it completely made up for my total lack of morning sickness early on! I couldn\u0027t keep anything down, I had started the process at about 9pm on the 15th, and by the time my dad was allowed in to see me at 9am on the 16th, I can tell you that I had definitely felt better. Cold sweats, the shakes and the vomiting had me wanting to go to the Winchester and wait for all this to blow over. I had initially wanted a drug free birth but given that  I\u0027d had the energy to throw a chair at anyone who talked to me - I would have, so I accepted anything and everything they threw at me. When the time came to offer me an epidural  I happily said yes. Anything, anything to stop this pain. So they plugged me in to the epidural and inserted a catheter and within 10 minutes, the absolutely crippling contractions, combine with violent bouts of sickness and enough sweat to fill a bath - stopped.  I was no longer in labour, and my baby was in distress   This seemed like a great thing but skipping through the story a little bit, turns out I\u0027d had too much happy juice and I was no longer in labour, and my baby was in distress. My previous optimistic mood went through the floor as I quickly signed my section paperwork and was wheeled off to theatre. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped to something like 50 beats per minute  I remember correctly. The normal pulse is 120-160 beats per minute. When they wheeled me into theatre they told me that the strength of the epidural meant that they wouldn\u0027t bother with any more anaesthetic, but when it came to it I needed two spinal injections and then a general anaesthetic to finally knock me out. The whole saga had been dramatic enough, it seemed only fitting enough I needed enough drugs to knock out a horse before this rollercoaster could finally come to stop.  Is it alive?  When I woke up I was so thirsty, my first sentence was, Water. Is it alive? It seems crazy but given the circumstances I just didn\u0027t believe that the universe wanted me to have this baby. I didn\u0027t do pregnancy properly and I couldn\u0027t even do the birth properly, something women have been doing forever and I just kept messing it up. Obviously this is nonsense but there\u0027s no harsher critic for anyone than the voice inside their head. Anyway, my baby was alive, he was a little boy and he\u0027s called Isaac and he is absolutely perfect. Two months previously I hadn\u0027t even known about his existence and now I couldn\u0027t see an existence without him. The love for him wasn\u0027t instant, I knew I\u0027d die for him but I didn\u0027t love him immediately. I don\u0027t believe in love at first sight and I didn\u0027t feel that I\u0027d had enough time to get ready for him, let alone love him. It didn\u0027t take long, I think it was the first time I cried post birth - about 10 days? I realised it wasn\u0027t about growing to love my boy, my boy was love.

The Uranus Examiner seems like the perfect pun - but some people say the name really stinks. It promises to get to the bottom of all stories, but people are ided on the issue and some have threatened to boycott it. The mayor of nearby Waynesville, Luge Hardman, said she found the title a little hard to stomach.  No. I\u0027m sorry. But the innuendo of that title puts the city up for public ridicule, she said. The title was launched in the small Pulaski County town on Wednesday, a week after another Missouri paper, the Waynesville Daily Examiner, was shut. Owner of the nearby Pulaski County News, Darrell Todd Maurina, said: That name does not indicate a serious newspaper.  Already on Twitter , people have been cracking jokes.  Julie wrote: Is writers block at The Uranus Examiner considered constipation? The newspaper\u0027s managing editor, Natalie Sanders, said the title was carefully considered before a decision was made.

Florence plowed into the Carolinas and lumbered slowly inland on Friday, knocking down trees, gorging rivers, dumping sheets of rain and leaving five people dead before it was downgraded to a tropical storm still capable of wreaking havoc. The Weather Channel\u0027s Mike Seidel was filming a piece to camera regarding the tropical storm and appeared to be struggling to stand his ground such was the ferocity of the wind. This is about as nasty as its been, said Seidel in video captured by dferent viewers. But eagle-eyed viewers noticed something behind him which appeared to show he was exaggerating.  Two men calmly walk in the background, apparently unaffected by the strong winds. In a matter of a few hours, the video on Facebook was seen more than four million times. A statement provided by the Weather Channel said: “It’s important to note that the two iniduals in the background are walking on concrete, and Mike Seidel is trying to maintain his footing on wet grass, after reporting on-air until 1am this morning and is undoubtedly exhausted.” Though Florence\u0027s shrieking winds diminished from hurricane force as it came ashore, forecasters said the sheer size of the 350-mile-wide storm and its painfully slow progress across North and South Carolina in the coming days could leave much of the region under water. The dead included a mother and baby who were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina.  The child\u0027s injured father was taken to a hospital. In the state\u0027s Pender County, a woman died of a heart attack paramedics trying to reach her were blocked by debris.  Two people died in Lenoir County. A 78-year-old man was electrocuted attempting to connect extension cords while another man perished when he was blown down by high winds while checking on his hunting dogs , a county spokesman said.  In New Bern, North Carolina, the storm surge overwhelmed the town of 30,000, located at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers.

The Mirror watched in horror as the disturbed beast cried out, while its mate paced up and down the tiny cage in front of their bloodied and leless young. These are the sickening and distressing scenes at the world’s most vile attraction, Pyongyang Central Zoo in North Korea.Jong-un personally ordered for millions to be spent on upgrading facilities in 2016, requesting that a huge model tiger’s head be installed at the entrance.  Our zoo guide excitedly told us: “Our Supreme Leader said the tiger was the symbol of bravery and courage and loved by all Korean people.” But despite the dictator’s words, little comfort or compassion is afforded to the defenceless animals kept here. Welfare experts reacted in complete disbelief after being shown the conditions, where animals suffer every day after being captured from around the globe and gted to the North Korean leaders. Jong-un has also told of his love of the deadly snakes in the reptile enclosure, where we saw more scenes of cruelty. Elsewhere we witnessed many \u0026shytraumatised animals with their heads wedged into the corners of their tiny enclosures, and crocodiles kept in barely two feet of water.  Rare green and loggerhead turtles swam in an algae-covered tank, which looked as though it had not been cleaned since former North Korea dictator Kim Jong-il “gted” them to the zoo in 2001. Some of the huge turtles, apparently favoured by Jong-un, were seen being manhandled by a callous keeper, who grabbed them by their tails and tossed them into a putrid pool. On the other side of the park, a dozen seals packed into a tiny enclosure wailed with stress, a lion roared in torment while staring into the corner of his tiny cage, and a malnourished Bengal tiger paced maniacally. Experts said all of them were showing “classic signs of torment” and last night described the attraction as “one of the worst cases of psychological abuse of animals ever seen”.  Despite the large plot, with huge grounds and towering exhibition buildings – including a natural history museum with models of dinosaurs – we saw only two zookeepers during our two-hour trip with our Korean minders, who thought nothing of the tragic conditions. One told us how Jong-un had visited the reptile exhibition in May 2016 and remarked how he loved the snakes for being “the symbol of longevity in le”. The Mirror spent eight days in the hermit kingdom, where repressive despot Jong-un rules with an iron fist.  We yesterday exposed the startling dference between the gleaming capital city Pyongyang, home to three million of the “elite”, and the desolate country\u0026shyside, where some 20 million farm workers scratch out an existence. And we showed how citizens \u0026shyslavishly consume the propaganda-fuelled rhetoric constantly pumped out by Jong-un and his cronies, while the country is battered by some of the world’s harshest sanctions. Our probe proves Jong-un’s regime thinks nothing of spending millions on creating a dystopian image of perfection while abandoning basic values and rights for humans and animals. Dr Chris Draper, head of welfare at animal rights organisation Born Free Foundation, said the zoo was “totally inappropriate” for all the animals.  He said: “Their cages are small, bare and there is no means of retreat from public view for them. It is most alarming to see the mother [tiger] and stillborn cub. There should’ve been a vet on the scene straight away. “There should have been intervention prior to this horrendous situation and, at the very least, immediate action should have been taken after the birth to establish why it occurred.” Humane Society International’s Wendy Higgins said: “This is a devastating, rare insight into the shockingly poor existence of animals at this zoo. [They] are confined to heartbreakingly small enclosures, often almost entirely barren, in which all they can do is pace or swim the same circular route. “Tigers, lions, sea lions and turtles all have complex, specic environmental needs that are essential for their mental and physical well-being, and here we have a classic example of a facility that meets virtually none of those needs.  “It’s little wonder that we see big cats here demonstrating stereotypical repetitive cage pacing, classic signs of mental distress as the animals struggle to cope with the monotony and deprivation. “This kind of zoo teaches nothing of the true nature of these animals because they exist as mere shadows of themselves.” More heartbreaking scenes came as groups of school\u0026shychildren looked at the exhibits. They were often encouraged by their teachers to clap and shout at the animals to get their attention – one of the worst things for a captive animal’s mental wellbeing, experts said. A red-eared turtle, which we were told had special signicance in Korea as it brought healing properties, lay in a small puddle of putrid water.  It had so little liquid that its tiny head popped out from the surface as it lay on the floor. The conditions were so awful that algae had grown on its shell, weighing down its tiny frame. The desperate scene was at complete odds with a fable our guide told us, in which the animal was so respected for its amazing qualities that an army of 200,000 men had been instructed to find and take care of it. The zoo was opened in 1959 by Kim Il-sung, Jong-un’s grandfather and the original Supreme Leader.  The Kim dynasty has continued each one’s obsession with capturing animals, with Il-sung visiting 20 times, his son Kim Jong-Il 31 times and current leader Jong-un six times. However, their interest has done nothing for the welfare of the animals.  One roof for tourists and dignitaries During our eight-day stay, we were ordered to stay at a hotel on an island and warned we could not leave without our government minders. The Yanggakdo Hotel is accessed by a bridge over the Taedong River, just outside the centre of Pyongyang. Dignitaries and foreign tourists are also put there. We watched as specially invited North Korea “friend\u0026shyship” delegations arrived in time for last Sunday’s military parade and Mass Games. We were bundled into a lt with controversial French actor Gerard Depardieu, a dubious guest of honour at the nation’s 70th anniversary foundation celebrations.

Two rescue workers were killed as they tried to free people trapped in a landslide in the mountainous Cordillera region. A body was found in a river in Manila as the strongest storm of 2018 hit the Pacic country, destroying homes and leaving hundreds of thousands in the dark. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from coastal areas following warnings of a 20ft storm surge, while hundreds were ordered to flee landslide-prone villages.  Fierce winds tore roofs off houses and brought down trees and power lines, while heavy rain triggered more than 40 landslides. Mangkhut, a Category 5 storm, is packing winds that are stronger than those of Hurricane Florence, which killed at least five people on the US East Coast before it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Known as Typhoon Ompong locally, it is the 15th storm to hit the Philippines this year. About a quarter of the estimated 4.2 million people affected by Saturday\u0027s storm live in poverty, and the United Nations estimated about 1.4 million farmers and 100,000 fishermen were hit by the typhoon, Reuters reported.  Rogelio Sending, a government official in Tuguegarao, the capital of Cagayan province, told Reuters: Almost all of the buildings here have been damaged, the roofs were blown away. There has been no electricity supply. Communications were also down. We\u0027ve received reports that many trees were uprooted and electric posts toppled and are blocking the roads. This makes the clearing operations really dficult.

I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out. Still, seven points from the last nine after a tricky start to the season is not too bad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united pair fyvie and king continue on their road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United pair Fraser Fyvie and Billy King continued their comebacks from injury in the Reserve League Cup on Tuesday.The two made their first appearances of the season in the Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Alloa at the weekend.After coming on late on against the Wasps, this time club captain Fyvie and winger King were both given the full first half.That puts them well down the road to a first-team , though it would be a major surprise  either were to feature in Saturday’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice.After being out since Christmas, Fyvie, in particular, is likely to continue his build-up in the reserves for another couple of weeks.The plan for him is to have him back only once he’s completed a full game for the second string.Their presence saw them help the Tangerines to a 2-1 win over Saints, though both United goals came late in the second period.Matty Smith, with his second goal in two games, levelled after Saints had gone ahead through Jordan Northcott.United then sealed the points from the opening group game when Louis Appere struck 18 minutes from the end.United, meanwhile, have switched their crucial Championship clash at Partick Thistle next month.The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 30, but with both teams’ interest in this season’s Irn-Bru at an end, they’ve brought it forward to Saturday, October 13, with a 3pm kick-off.As well as suiting fans, it means both teams will avoid a three-game week at the end of the month.Had United progressed in the Irn-Bru they would have faced Dunfermline in the third round.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"future of popular local museum in doubt","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe future of a popular museum is in doubt unless organisers can find new premises.Monieth House of Memories, managed by Monieth Local History Society, is seeking an alternative location after its High Street base became unusable.Margaret Copland, of the society, said there was now a real danger the museum could be forced to close.She said: “Not only are we risking our own health and safety due to adverse conditions, we are exposing members of the public who visit to those same dangers.“As a result, we are desperately trying to find a new home but we are finding that extremely dficult.Ms Copland added: “For the past 14 years we have built up a massive collection of items on the history and heritage of Monieth.“We have a huge online following and people come from far and wide to trace their ancestors and find out as much as they can about their local heritage.“We have become very well recognised and regularly loan items to other museums.“We are now a major tourist attraction and our volunteers do a marvellous job of running the centre and keeping the history and heritage of Angus alive.”The society has submitted a community asset transfer request, asking for a lease on another Angus Council-owned property, the former Angus Access office which was also the police station, which will go before councillors next month.Ms Copland said the dream was ultimately to create a Monieth Heritage Centre but added: “We desperately want to continue providing the service we do but we need someone to come forward to help us.

We all really look forward to our days at the centre.

There is no option to retain services at St Andrews or Glenrothes.Local people can attend meetings at Waid Community Campus, Anstruther, on Thursday and in St Andrews Town Hall on September 24, both at 6.45pm.Mr Rennie said: “Everybody I have spoken to has expressed a clear view it should not happen and there is a growing anger.”Fe Health and Social Care Partnership director Michael Kellet said there had been no option. “Fe is experiencing the impact of shortages of key staff,” he said.“In response we have put in place the contingency measures to ensure a safe and reliable service.

Across the road, in Slessor Gardens, celebrations to mark the opening continue with the second day of the 3D Festival.The event will feature a host of on-stage performances and a number of family activities.Things kick off at 11am as musician SHHE – otherwise known as Su Shaw or Panda Su – takes to the stage.She said: “Dundee is special – it doesn’t show off in ways that other cities do – so maybe in the past you had to work harder to find that out.“I’m excited to be joining some incredible local artists on-stage to celebrate its opening.”Keeping the music going from 11.50am will be Kashmir Crows, a six-piece based in the city.The group – who have been likened to bands such as Arcade Fire and Black Keys – play a mix of alternative rock, indie, soul, blues and funk, and are a familiar act on the local music scene.Lead singer Ian Black, from Lochee, said: “We pride ourselves on being a Dundonian band and to be a part of the biggest cultural event in Dundee for generations, we’re totally over the moon. We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm. Featuring Katie Lynch and Mark Johnston, they claim to have crafted a “unique sound” through music “laced with dark tones”.Katie said: “The V\u0026ampA is bringing something new to the creative scene here in Dundee, which has been needing a good refresh. We’re extremely lucky as a band and I want to see more people get the chance to get involved in the music business. Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b98d992afff4-417x564.jpg ","title":"wins can have dundee united ready to host the teams from the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even  the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a ision where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And,  United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is signicant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to  to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a dficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see  that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the ision.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but,  it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie

Additional allowances are also paid for summer holidays, Christmas and birthdays.Foster carers do not have to own their own home and do not need to be married. They can also be single or living with someone, including in a same-sex relationship. They can be from any ethnic background.Training and support is provided.For more information on fostering, contact 01463 702743 or email fostering@highland.gov.ukSaturday 15 Sep 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117425.jpg","title":"Gay parade plan for Inverness prompts petition","story":"\u0026nbspHUNDREDS of people have signed a petition opposing a planned parade in Inverness city centre to celebrate gay culture, describing it as unsavoury and deeply offensive.The organisers of Proud Ness, set to take place on October 6, have applied for permission to stage a march along High Street to Eden Court Theatre.But Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , has gathered about 600 names on a petition opposing the parade on moral, religious and biblical grounds and also written a letter to Highland Council.Mr Morrison, of Old Edinburgh Road, Inverness, claimed in gay marches elsewhere members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender  community flaunted their immorality in the most extravagant ways imaginable.\"This becomes evident especially in city centres when they thrust lewdness in the faces of men, women and children alike by frolicking unashamedly on rainbow-coloured floats making obscene sexual gestures,\" he said.\"If this unsavoury event is given planning permission then these desperately sad scenes are now likely to be witnessed very tragically in Inverness on October 6.\"Mr Morrison said the city streets were public places and should be kept child-friendly, family-friendly and people-friendly but maintained this was not the case when immoral behaviour and lestyles were promoted in their spaces.The petition includes signatures from across the region including Ullapool and Skye,\u0026nbsp although Mr Morrison said most were from Inverness and included Christians and non-Christians.

Grantown-on-Spey and Dunvegan on Skye will both find themselves with the same MP under the proposals \u0026ndash despite being separated by 158 miles.The Boundary Commission for Scotland has defended its proposals, arguing that population limits for each new constituency had tied its hands over the revised boundaries.It said: \"We noted that many respondents had objected to the size of the constituencies in the revised proposals, particularly Highland North, and that these objections were understandable.\"We considered, however, that the requirements in legislation with regard to the number of electors in each constituency and the low population density of the areas in question meant creating large constituencies could not be avoided.\"Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117491.jpg","title":"Shop staff begin charity bike ride for Sam","story":"\u0026nbspCo-op staff from across the Highlands are taking on the North Coast 500 to raise funds for the Step Up for Sam campaign.Workers from 19 branches left Telford Street store on Sunday September 9, and are due to arrive back in the Highland capital tomorrow.The 559-mile trip marks the end of the three-month fundraising drive for the charity, which aims to fund vital treatment for three-year-old Sam Douglas.The youngster has an undiagnosed neurological condition which causes epilepsy and developmental delay, and requires intensive therapies, many of which are not available on the NHS.Invergordon store manager Lorraine Davidson, whose idea it was to support the campaign, said: \"It\u0027 a huge endurance challenge but all in aid of a very special little boy.\"We\u0026rsquove all been incredibly touched by Sam\u0027 story and can\u0026rsquot wait to see just how much we\u0026rsquove raised from our in-store fundraising and the sponsored cycle event.\"Co-op area manager Daniel Simpson added: \"We really wanted to set ourselves a big challenge and we\u0026rsquove certainly done that in the North Coast 500.\"It\u0027 not for the faint hearted but is very befitting of this very worthy cause.\"Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b51ba564c168-891x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen fcs shaleum logan feels aggrieved over devlin red card","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons defender Shaleum Logan today claimed Mikey Devlin should not have been red carded as he was tracking back to make a vital challenge.Referee Craig Thomson sent Devlin off after just five minutes of the 2-0 loss to Kilmarnock for denying a clear scoring chance. 100vw, 620px\" /That dismissal hinged on Devlin being the last man.However, Devlin was 35 yards out from goal and Logan insists he would have tracked back in time to make a challenge on Eamonn Brophy to deny a shot at goal.Aberdeen put forward a case to the SFA fast-track appeals panel that Devlin did not deny a clear goalscoring opportunity.The Reds also presented footage from ious angles of Brophy tugging Devlin’s shirt in the build- up to the red card incident.The appeal for wrongful dismissal was rejected.Logan said: “I would definitely, 100%, have got round, as it was still 35 yards from goal.“I don’t even think he  thought of that straight away. He is the referee who sent me off at Celtic. It is what it is.“Devlin has a one-match ban and we have good enough players to fill in for him. Do I think it’s right? I don’t but we deal with it and move on.”Thomson has history with Aberdeen. Logan was sent-off by the whistler following full-time in the 1-0 win at Celtic in the final league game of last season.The Dons appealed Logan’s dismissal but were unsuccessful and the right-back was suspended for the first three domestic games of this campaign.Asked  the SFA outlined why they made the decision on his appeal, he said: “It was explained to me but my argument was explained to them. It was like an hour and a half on the phone with them.“People make their decisions down at Hampden.“I can only say my end of the story and you have a board that will decide what your fate is.“Looking back on it, it was so soft but you cannot cry over spilt milk so I get on with it.”Following the SFA’s explanation for upholding the Devlin red card, the Dons released a statement stating it was “unacceptable”.It also read: “It is imperative for the country’s football authorities to establish consistency and transparency in the appeal and referral process and will engage in dialogue with the SPFL in this regard to seek their assistance.”Aberdeen also insisted VAR needs to be considered.In recent weeks, Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos had a red for a kick at Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna downgraded on appeal to yellow.A three-man panel of ex-grade one officials also looked at a kick out from Rangers\u0026#8217 Allan McGregor at Kristoffer Ajer, of Celtic, and failed to reach a unanimous conclusion it was a red-card offence.Kilmarnock’s Gary Dicker had an appeal for a red card for a fair tackle rejected by the separate appeals panel which dealt with both Devlin’s and Morelos’ cases.Logan insists recent decisions have bred confusion. He said: “It seems like you don’t know what you can do these days that gets a red card.“With me, it was like what is tolerable? Do people think decisions are wrong? Definitely. It could have been resolved but they chose not to.”Logan accepts officials do have dficult tasks and in the cut and thrust of games, errors are inevitable. What should also be inevitable is that those mistakes are rectied on appeal. He said: “Referees do have a tough job.“However,  they get a decision wrong and it goes to where you can look at it again sometimes you still don’t get the right outcome.“There is no bad feeling towards referees. Some are lenient, some aren’t.“There are dferent types of referees, just like there are dferent types of players, linesmen and managers.“They have tough decisions and everyone can’t be right.”An SFA statement read: “We are always open to making the system more transparent with written reasons for fast-track proceedings now published on the Scottish FA website alongside details of all notices of complaint and claims lodged and dealt with under the judicial panel protocol.“The clubs, players and managers are represented in the ongoing review of the judicial panel protocol and we will welcome any input this season through our usual processes.“In addition, our referee operations department will continue to offer the opportunity to clubs to be refreshed on the current coaching guidance given to referees and any modications to the laws of the game in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinnes why i never signed saints watt","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes today revealed he did not move to sign Tony Watt because he wanted a striker with more pace.The 24-year-old trained with Aberdeen at the end of last season having been released by Belgian side OH Leuven.Although a free agent, the Scotland international could not sign for any club until the summer as he had already played for Charlton and OH Leuven that term.Watt joined St Johnstone on a season-long deal and has scored six goals.He scooped the Premiership Player of the Year award for August.Watt will come up against the Dons in league action for Saints at McDiarmid Park today.McInnes admits he considered signing Watt, but wanted someone with more speed to lead the attack.

They came to light after Aitken’s home was searched by police.After Aitken was locked up and placed on the sex offenders\u0026#8217 register for 10 years, a spokesman for NSPCC Scotland said: “Behind every image is a real child suffering appalling abuse and, through possessing these images, Aitken has only fuelled the demand for this sickening material to be produced.“NSPCC Scotland works in schools and in the community to prevent abuse and is campaigning for internet companies to do far more to prevent vile abuse images from being produced.”He said any adult concerned about the welfare of a child or young person can call the NSPCC helpline on 0808 800 5000, while children can call Childline on 0800 1111.At the sentencing hearing defence agent Andrew Ormiston said his client, whose

“spectacular breach of trust”.Rosemary Ewen or Gotts, known as Shirran, offered to take care of finances for her 77-year-old aunt following the death of her uncle.But instead Shirran, 53, helped herself to thousands of pounds, making daily cash withdrawals – and even buying a car.Fiscal depute Katy Begg told Aberdeen Sherf Court the crime was uncovered after the pensioner’s carers became concerned about certain transactions.She said: “She started to receive bills for things she had no knowledge of and that triggered an investigation.”The offence took place between January 2015 and August 2016 at an address at Brimmond Court, Aberdeen, and elsewhere.Ms Begg said: “A police financial analyst was instructed to carry out a forensic examination of the aunt’s banking records.“It was noted there were signicant changes to her banking habits.“It was noted there had been large transfers of money from her account into the account of the accused, and a few other accounts of people known to be associated with the accused.“It was established £7,500 had been obtained by the accused by fraud.”Ms Begg added: “She bought a car and the rest was cash withdrawals.“For a period £300 was taken out of that account on a daily basis from ious locations in Aberdeen.“The aunt confirmed she had not withdrawn these sums.“Further inquiries were made and it was ascertained a number of other accounts had been opened in her name and that numerous items had been purchased all of which she had no knowledge of.”On August 31 2016 Shirran was cautioned and detained.Shirran, of Kirkhill Road, Aberdeen, pled guilty to forming a fraudulent scheme, offering to look after her aunt’s finances then withdrawing cash, opening new bank accounts in her name, using her accounts to pay household and personal bills, and opening accounts with ious companies including Littlewoods and Sky, and obtaining cash, goods and services totalling £7,500 by fraud.Defence agent Bob Anderson said his client was “aghast” at the amount of money she had spent.He said: “The background is Mrs Shirran did assist her aunt over the period in question and there were quite signicant sums paid for refurbishing of the aunt’s address.“It was one of these situations where over a period of time Mrs Shirran used money that she shouldn’t have done.“She was somewhat aghast at how much was involved over that period of time.“She did provide support to her aunt and I think the indication by her aunt when she endeavoured to retract matters was she didn’t want to get her niece into trouble.”Sherf Philip Mann deferred sentence until next month for reports to be prepared and told Shirran a jail sentence has not been ruled out.He said: “This is a serious offence. It’s a gross and spectacular breach of trust.“Despite the fact you’re a first offender I will need to consider all available disposals which could include a custodial sentence.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"club donates last of funds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA children\u0026#8217s sports club which closed down recently has donated £8,000 to charities.The Grampian Junior Bowling Association, which catered for young people aged 9-17, was forced to close after seats on the committee were left vacant.The team was set up in 2005 to encourage young people to get into the sport of indoor and outdoor bowling.

submitted two separate proposals to Aberdeen City Council for Custom House on Guild Street in the Granite City.In July the company was seeking permission from the local authority to convert floors one to six at the building into 49 flats.As revealed in the Evening Express last month, the firm also lodged plans to turn the vacant office into a new 106-bedroom hotel.Planning permission has also been requested for outside alterations, as the building lies in a conservation area.A spokeswoman for Mandale Construction North said: “We are running both schemes through the planning system at the moment to leave our options open as to the building’s end use.“At this moment in time, neither scheme is superseding the other.”The building currently houses a McColl’s shop on the ground floor with vacant former office space spread across the upper floors.More than 100 HM Revenue and Customs  employees used to work out of offices within the building, but were rehoused in 2006 when it was announced the building was closing. No parking is proposed for the site other than the 12 existing spaces in the building’s basement which will be retained as part of both of the proposals.Castlehill and Pittodrie Community Council has welcomed the update and said there should possibly be a degree of flexibility regarding the proposals.Jonathan Smith, chairman of the group, said: “We will be looking to have some formal consultation with the community before putting our views forward. I am happy that both applications are being taken forward and the affordable flats are also still going ahead.“Regardless of the outcome, affordable housing in the city centre is still something we would be promoting.“There are a number of hotel applications for the city centre which is a concern as there might not be the uptake once considered.“I think that there should be some degree of flexibility.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead library is breeding bookworms","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 11:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead youngsters have been rewarded for their efforts in this summer\u0026#8217s library reading challenge.As part of the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge, the children were to visit their local library and read three books over the summer holidays.

It is a place precious to many who come to seek solitude and appreciate the remote and beautul landscape. It is impossible to mitigate the visual impact. Its presence alone would remove the wilderness and scenic qualities valued by many.\u0026#8217The area is designated ‘Wild Land’ and ‘Area of Panoramic Quality’ and lies within the Inner Hebrides and The Minches Special Area of Conservation , she said, and is \u0026#8216rich in rare wildle\u0026#8217, such as harbour porpoises, dolphins, and minke, killer and sei whales.\u0026#8216The plan shows Acoustic Deterrent Devices  would be used to deter seals. Cetaceans can be displaced by ADDs at ranges of 7km. The cumulative impact will be devastating to these species.\u0026#8216Impacts from lice, disease, pesticides and waste, to not only wild fish, but other marine le is unacceptable. The estates on Islay and Jura work hard to conserve and enhance their local native populations.\u0026#8216The proposal is flawed: there has been no consideration to the exposed nature of the site and the high potential for escaped stock and mooring instability of the cages.\u0026#8216There has been no hydrodynamic modelling, no benthic  biology survey submitted, maximum stocking biomass has been increased to levels for which further investigations are needed and fallow periods are unsustainably short. Impacts to other wildle have not been considered.\u0026#8216A promise of six jobs, whilst sacricing a rare wild landscape and unspoiled marine habitats, is not appropriate nor sustainable economic development.\u0026#8217Stuart Cannon, managing director of Kames Fish Farming Limited, said it is \u0026#8216an environmentally responsible company which has produced high quality, sustainable fish for more than 45 years.\u0026#8216We are very much aware there is a balance to be struck, and would not want to place a site where there would be risk to the amazing bioersity we have on the west coast.\u0026#8216We have withdrawn applications in the past where the scientic assessment of the site has suggested the site is not suitable.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cakes and coffee make a zambian difference","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 3:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowZamScotEd, the Mid Argyll-based charity that supports education in Zambia, is close to achieving three of the UN’s sustainable development goals in Lusaka, where its secondary school is steadily growing.If you pop in to ZamScotEd’s next coffee morning in Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall, you will help to put the icing on the cake of St Columba’s third classroom block – the science building that will enable pupils to forge ahead and gain qualications to work in their country’s industries and professions.ZamScotEd founder, Marian Pallister, was back in Zambia this summer to check on the progress of the much needed secondary school the organisation initiated in one of the poorest communities on the fringe of Lusaka.She said: \u0026#8216Progress has been amazing. St Columba\u0026#8217s Community Secondary Day School opened in January 2016 with one classroom block match funded by Missio Scotland.Last year, with the help of the Spanish organisation Manos Unidas, the second classroom block opened and there was an amazing 100 per cent pass rate for the important Grade 9 exam – roughly equating to our Nat 5. Now, with funding from another Spanish organisation, Africa Directo, the science block has been built and ZamScotEd is committed to completing the interior and providing the furniture and equipment.\u0026#8217Marian added that Manos Unidas have just agreed to fund the fourth and final classroom block.There are now 190 pupils at the school, which is run by ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s Zambian partners, the Teresian Sisters, and there are 95 boys and 95 girls.\u0026#8216Our aims are to meet three of the UN\u0026#8217s sustainable development goals,\u0026#8217 Marian continued. \u0026#8216Goal number four is quality education, and head teacher Sr Veronica Nyoni and her team  are achieving that.\u0026#8216Goal number five is gender equality – and we\u0026#8217re spot on there. These two can lead to Goal number one, which is to eliminate poverty.

Mid Argyll\u0026#8217s Bar None Community Choir were excellent, as were duo Holly Renton from Inveraray and Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s Tiegan Holroyd bringing their soft, melodic tones to the festival once again.The big hitters were on the main stage. Former Runrig frontman Donnie Munro delighted audience members of a certain age with songs old and new on Saturday evening. At the opposite end of the experience spectrum, Cowal outfit Heron Valley showed why they are currently home in between US tours.The energetic Celtic sound of American band Seven Nations had the Friday night joint jumping ahead of Tide Lines, lead singer Robert Robertson all blue eyes and boundless energy.Arguably the Saturday show was stolen by the colour, noise and drama of the Bhangra Beatles \u0026#8211 with Fab Four favourites handed an Indian twist of spice.Argyll acts held their own and more among illustrious company.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service .\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of le, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots. It was answered and delivered by these two brave and ambitious local ladies, who with the community at heart, saved Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Post Office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"photos-group-of-flamingo-chicks-hatch-in-oxton","story":"A GROUP of flamingo chicks have hatched at a Borders conservation centre.\nNews of the arrival of the Chilean flamingo flock was confirmed by Bird Gardens Scotland.\nThe newborns\u0026nbspwill form part of a new visitor attraction in Oxton, near Lauder.\nThe chicks hatched from eggs laid by the established Chilean flamingo flock at Chester Zoo.\nThe flock at Chester had a breeding success earlier in the summer, leading to a number of surplus eggs.\nThe eggs in question were incubated by the Bird Section in Chester prior to being carefully transported to Bird Gardens Scotland in Oxton, to hatch.\nIts not been confirmed how many chicks there are.\nFollowing on from hatching, the eggs will take 30 days to develop into healthy flamingo chicks, also known as flaminglings.\nMark Haillay of Bird Gardens Scotland said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an incredible moment when you first hear a flamingo egg grunt at you and you know that within 48 hours there will be a chick asleep, resting after its epic journey from inside the egg out into the world.\nLike many other types of bird, flaminglings have an egg-tooth on the tip of their beak which they use to gradually scratch and chip away at the shell creating an opening large enough for them to wriggle free of the shell and out into the world.\nThe flaminglings will be hand reared in Oxton, fed every two hours round the clock with a specialist liquidised diet fed through a syringe.\nThis mimics the beak-to-beak feeding which would occur in parent reared birds parent flamingos produce a rich saliva  and dribble this into the chick\u0026rsquos beak providing all the water, nutrients and energy they need to grow and stay healthy.\nMark added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting to think these little balls of grey fluff will grow to be majestic flamingos.

early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised

which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the

championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.

Officials said the changes involved positioning of new properties and parking but did not alter the number of homes planned for the land.  The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked  it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.  Following the meeting, Craig Ormond, director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, said: \u0026ldquoLethington Gardens already features Design Collection properties, so we wanted to ensure that these neighbouring houses have a similar look and feel in design terms. We are delighted that the council have agreed with us.  Lethington Gardens is part of a wider masterplan by a number of housing developers in the area.  The plans include a new primary school at the heart of the development \u0026ndash to be home to nearly 500 pupils \u0026ndash sport pitches and changing facilities, as well as a new park running east/west alongside the Letham Burn."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-club-needs-cctv-after-licence-change","story":"  North Berwick RFC  applied to East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board for the licence, which allows it to welcome non-members to events.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.  The plans will be revealed for the first time on Tuesday at Haddington\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre.  The drop-in session, which runs from 3pm to 7pm, will allow members of the public to see the initial designs and also speak to members of the team behind the proposals. A second event takes place 6-8pm at East Linton Primary School on October 24.  Mr Rintoul added: \u0026ldquoThe National Museum of Flight is already a signicant component of East Lothian\u0026rsquos visitor economy and this investment will drive additional employment opportunities and help further stimulate the development of the area\u0026rsquos tourism sector.  \u0026ldquoThis is the next step in the development of the museum, which started with the arrival of Concorde in 2004 and has seen extensive investment in the site in recent years, including the creation of new exhibitions in 2009 and the restoration and re-display of two original Second World War hangars in 2016.  \u0026ldquoWe hope that residents will take the opportunity to come along to one of our two planned consultation events, view the design and discuss it with our team. We\u0026rsquore keen to hear what people think of our proposals.  Ahead of the two exhibitions, National Museums Scotland has contacted East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning and economic development and strategic investment departments.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

China and the Philippines agreed to postpone a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that was to start on Sunday due to the onslaught, which caused nearly 150 flights \u0026ndash a third of them international \u0026ndash to be cancelled and halted sea travel.  Presidential adviser Francis Tolentino said the 12 died mostly in landslides and houses that got pummelled by the storm\u0026rsquos fierce winds and rain.  Among the dead were an infant and a two-year-old child who died with their parents after the couple refused to immediately evacuate from their high-risk community in a mountain town in Nueva Vizcaya province, Mr Tolentino said.  President Rodrigo Duterte has assigned Mr Tolentino to help co-ordinate disaster response. Mr Tolentino said at least two other people were missing and that the death toll could climb to at least 16 once other casualty reports were veried.  Mayor Mauricio Domogan said at least three people died and six others were missing in the mountain city of Baguio after strong winds and rain destroyed several houses and set off landslides, which also blocked roads to the popular vacation destination.  Authorities were verying the drownings of three people, including two children who reportedly died as the typhoon approached.  About 70 men reportedly ed to their coastal village in Cagayan to check on their homes as the typhoon drew closer Friday, but Mr Tolentino said he had received no report of the men figuring in an accident.  Mangkhut\u0026rsquos sustained winds weakened to 105mph, with gusts of up to 160mph, after it sliced north-west across Luzon before blowing out to the South China Sea, aiming at Hong Kong and elsewhere in southern China.  About 87,000 people evacuated from high-risk areas of the Philippines. Mr Tolentino and other officials advised them not to  home until the danger had passed.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos still a le-and-death situation, defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana said, citing past drownings in swollen rivers in mountain provinces after storms had passed.  Storm warnings remained in effect in 10 northern provinces, including Cagayan, which could still be lashed by devastating winds, forecasters said. Thousands of people in the typhoon\u0026rsquos path had been evacuated.  At daybreak in Cagayan\u0026rsquos capital, Tuguegarao, Associated Press journalists saw a severely damaged public market, its roof ripped apart and wooden stalls and tarpaulin canopies in disarray. Outside a popular shopping centre, debris was scattered everywhere and government workers cleared roads of fallen trees.  Many stores and houses were damaged but most residents remained indoors as occasional gusts sent small pieces of tin sheets and other debris flying dangerously.  The Tuguegarao airport terminal was badly damaged, its roof and glass windows shattered by strong winds that also sent chairs, tables and papers flipping about inside, Mr Lorenzana said.  A government damage assessment was under way except in areas still being battered by winds and rain. Two air force C-130 cargo planes and 10 helicopters were on standby in the capital Manila to help transport rescuers and aid supplies.  More than five million people were at risk from the storm, which the Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Centre downgraded from a super typhoon. Mangkhut, however, was still punching powerful winds and gusts equivalent to a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8688280.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"sturgeon-urged-to-announce-plans-for-second-independence-referendum","story":"  Several hundred people, many waving saltires, attended the This Time It\u0026rsquos Yes rally at George Square organised by Hope Over Fear, compered by former MSP Tommy Sheridan.

He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking.

He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"a-new-beginning-for-dundee","story":"  August and the sun is shining. Down at the city\u0026rsquos waterfront, outside the new Sleeperz hotel, next to the revamped train station entrance, a group of Japanese tourists are sitting on the large sculpted pebbles that dot the forecourt. A new office block is under construction across the street and in Slessor Gardens there\u0026rsquos a women\u0026rsquos yoga class going en plein air  Not so very long ago this was all concrete and tarmac round here. Now everything has changed. And the change is spreading beyond the waterfront too. In the streets around and behind the Malmaison hotel you can find a smattering of new shops, delis and vegan cafes .  And this in a city that only two years ago was seen as an entrepreneurial black spot. In 2015 the Courier reported that in there had been only 48 applications for grants to StartUp Britain in the previous three years. Now Dundee appears to be open for business.  This is the new face of the city. But it\u0026rsquos down at the waterfront that you will see its most visible manestation.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee, which opens today, is the reason that, for the first time in many years you might say, the city is suddenly hip, \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos coolest city, according to the Wall Street Journal. Vogue has also been singing the city\u0026rsquos praises.  The changes are being noticed by locals too. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see more restaurants, shops, fashion labels launching, says fashion designer Hayley Scanlan, herself a Dundee native. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos so much happening. Young people are doing their own thing. It\u0026rsquos amazing and inspirational. People have had the guts to do stuff because they can see there is an opportunity.  The prospect of the V\u0026ampA Dundee, she says, has \u0026ldquobrought light to the city.  And yet there are still shadows. Some of them are the shadows that every modern city contends with. Things like the death of the high street for one.   Other shadows are darker. It was revealed earlier this year that one in four children in the city live in poverty.  This is a city that has suffered as much as any in the post-industrial age with widescale loss of jobs . And in some families unemployment has become generational.  Suspicions about the hype and hope that surrounds Dundee at the moment is perhaps to some extent understandable After all Dundee has had more than its unfair share of failed regenerations in the past. The new museum sits on one of them. Once the city\u0026rsquos dock, it was torn up in the 1960s \u0026ndash including an arch built to commemorate the visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to the city in the 19th century \u0026ndash to create slip roads off the bridge.  Still, the V\u0026ampA Dundee is part of the city\u0026rsquos attempt to rewrite a reputation that has for years \u0026ndash maybe even decades - been written off.  The question is how did we get here? What has allowed this to happen and what might it lead to?  Few people are better equipped to answer all of this than Mike Galloway. Galloway grew up in Glasgow and Perth  and, after a successful career in urban planning in Glasgow where he worked on the regeneration of the Merchant City and the Gorbals, he became Dundee\u0026rsquos Director of City Planning in 1997.  Today, sitting on the top floor of Dundee House looking out over the Tay Estuary, he is remembering the city he found 21 years ago.  \u0026ldquoIts image was extremely poor he recalls. \u0026ldquoReally poor. Its self-image was really poor. Dundonians did not regard their city very highly.  They were not the only ones. When he told colleagues in Glasgow he was moving to Dundee they thought he was crazy. \u0026ldquoThey thought it was a coffin job, he admits.  \u0026ldquoWe were losing population hand over fist and  that continued the whole infrastructure of the city was under threat.  But when he applied for the job, he says, there were already signs that Dundee wanted things to change.  \u0026ldquoWhat I found was a city that was really determined to reinvent itself. There was a whole campaign to put the heart back into the city, to try to recover Dundee\u0026rsquos reputation, its image, to try and recapture its retail catchment area, for example. It was on the verge.  \u0026ldquoThere was an effort to restructure the economy away from manufacturing to knowledge-based. Back in the mid-1990s that was very dangerous, very Avant Garde, particularly for a strong Labour council to be proposing that.  In a way that sense of incipient change was what drew him here. He\u0026rsquod first lived in Dundee was a student in the mid-1970s, and a couple of decades later, he ed for a joint 40th birthday party with his we.\u0026nbsp  Walking around the city that weekend he was impressed by the changes from the city he knew 20 years earlier. A few weeks later he saw the ad in the paper for his job and he applied. \u0026ldquoI tell the story that I came to Dundee for a party and I never left, he says, smiling.  It was a good time to come, he says. Things were changing. Within two years the DCA would open, giving the city\u0026rsquos image a boost. The universities were beginning to help establish the city\u0026rsquos reputation as a centre of design . In some areas the city was on an upswing.  That didn\u0026rsquot mean more changes weren\u0026rsquot needed. \u0026ldquoThe one place that really let the city down was the waterfront, where the Tay Bridge came in and joined in the city centre, recalls Galloway. It was just a morass of motorways, bridges, brutalist buildings. And yet that was Dundee\u0026rsquos front door. That\u0026rsquos where you arrived, whether by train or by car. That was your first impression and first impressions stick.  His solution, complete redevelopment of the waterfront. A project with a timeframe that stretched to decades. Urban regeneration is rarely a quick fix. That redevelopment has been a priority for the city ever since.  There were strokes of good fortune along the way. Dundee was able to benefit from the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Cities Growth Fund. It made the decision to channel all that money into the waterfront. The city also managed to tap funds from Scottish Enterprise and did the same with it.  And all of this, it should be noted, has been done over the last decade in the teeth of recession.  \u0026ldquoBut in some ways that was an advantage, suggests Galloway. \u0026ldquoBecause we got really keen prices. The fact that there wasn\u0026rsquot a buoyant development market out there wasn\u0026rsquot problematic. We got good prices. We got really committed contractors to work with because there was a dearth of business for them elsewhere.  The idea of a museum on the waterfront wasn\u0026rsquot part of the original masterplan. But, Galloway says, they were looking for a big idea. That big idea arrived over food in 2007.  Early that year Sir Mark Jones, the then director of the V\u0026ampA museum, was in Dundee to have a look at what was going on at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design. The college laid on a lunch for him and invited a selection of guests from the city. Galloway was one of them.  \u0026ldquoThe \u0026lsquoBilbao effect\u0026rsquo was very big at the time, Galloway recalls, referring to the impact Frank Gehry\u0026rsquos Guggenheim museum had on the economy of the northern Spanish city. \u0026ldquoWe were explaining to him what we\u0026rsquore doing on the waterfront here and he was interested, so we said: \u0026lsquoLook, before you get your flight back can we show you around?\u0026rsquo  Jones said yes. A few days later he called Galloway and said he\u0026rsquod like to continue the conversation. The idea of V\u0026ampA Dundee was in utero.  The story of the building of Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos design is a saga in itself, a story of reigning in the original ambition and an inflationary budget   This week another argument emerged when Chrissie Hynde, of all people, moaned about the office block being built just across the road from the museum, calling it a \u0026ldquomonstrosity which should be torn down.  Galloway argues that it is part of the change that Dundee needs. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is an anchor building in the waterfront development that will encourage tourists and business tourists . But it can\u0026rsquot stand alone.  Right now, though, the museum itself is an opportunity to change the city\u0026rsquos image. Philip Long, the V\u0026ampA Dundee director, suggests that, in fact, it\u0026rsquos already happening. \u0026ldquoThe city is reclaiming its waterfront and it has had the ambition to go out and award the most amazing building project to Kengo Kuma which is now not just being used to portray Dundee but is being used in the Scotland Now campaign. So, the city is being understood in dferent ways.  The interest from Vogue and the Wall Street Journal would suggest as much.  But just how far does that understanding go in the city itself?  On Dundee\u0026rsquos Whitfield estate in the north of the city, tucked in behind a low-rise office block there is a garden of remembrance. At the entrance of this \u0026ldquoGarden of Hope row upon row of brass tags hang on the fence. On each is inscribed a message of love and loss.  Barrie, 51, is a service manager with Addaction, a national charity set up to help those suffering from dependency issues. Every day he meets with drug addicts and their families in the area and offers support and comfort.  \u0026ldquoWhat we are trying to do is create a place where people can come together and support one another and also try and heal a little bit, he explains  There is a lot of healing to be done. Last year Dundee took over from Glasgow as the city with the highest number of drug deaths per resident in the country .  Barrie is all too aware of the impact those deaths can have on family members and friends. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom supporting one family that has lost three sons to overdoses, he says. We\u0026rsquore hearing about eight-year-old girls who are self-harming after losing their mums to drugs.  \u0026ldquoThere was a guy in this morning who has lost about a dozen close people to drug death. If you\u0026rsquore coping with that level of loss on top of your own issues it\u0026rsquos hard and drugs and alcohol, as we know, are a way of coping for a lot of people. It\u0026rsquos not a good way. It\u0026rsquos a very dangerous way.  Drug deaths, Barrie suggests, is harder to talk about than cancer. There is a huge stigma involved.  But over and above everything else, he says, poverty is the major contributory factory. Last year it was revealed that in the previous five years Dundee had more benefit sanctions applied than anywhere else in the country.  \u0026ldquoSo, masses of this will be to do with poverty and lack of aspiration or lack of choices, Barrie suggests. \u0026ldquoYou put it all together we\u0026rsquore at the head of a storm.  It only takes a few minutes to drive from the waterfront to Whitfield but at times the distance must seem huge.  Barrie himself is excited about the museum opening and about taking some of his clients to see it. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a fantastic opportunity for Dundee. I get goose bumps even thinking about it.  But he also worries that it might have an alienating effect on those he works with. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom wondering  the V\u0026ampA is almost reinforcing the hopelessness in a weird way. It\u0026rsquos so beautul, so perfect \u0026hellip If your le is the opposite of that \u0026hellip \u0026ldquo  It\u0026rsquos something that concerns Hayley Scanlan too. \u0026ldquoI just think all this hope is being put into this one thing and are people going to be disappointed? What is the backlash going to be?  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the old analogy that when the tide comes in all the boats rise, says Galloway. \u0026ldquoThe problem in cities like Dundee is that some of the boats are chained to the bottom and they\u0026rsquore not going to benefit unless we do something specically to make it happen.  \u0026ldquoOne of the key challenges I\u0026rsquove been given by the council and politicians is to ensure the waterfront has meaning in terms of jobs and income for everybody in the city. So, the fact that we\u0026rsquove committed to the living wage in the waterfront is not the usual sticker badge in it. It\u0026rsquos genuine.  When Sleeperz came to Dundee wanting to operate the hotel at the waterfront, Galloway explains, the city told the hoteliers they would have to pay the living wage. They were initially reticent because of the cost and the precedent. But in tandem with the council they found a workaround and now the company is going to introduce the living wage in all its hotels.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos through that kind of activity that we are much more likely to have a waterfront and things in that waterfront that really mean something to people in Whitfield and all of the communities across the city.  Philip Long believes it would be wrong to suggest that the V\u0026ampA Dundee is some kind of panacea for all of the city\u0026rsquos issues. It can help with economic investment, he says, \u0026ldquobut we\u0026rsquore only part of everything else that is going on.  What it does offer, he adds, is a facility that can help make a dference to people\u0026rsquos lives in the city, whether that is through employment or even just inspiration.  And people are being inspired. Dundee is changing. Hayley Scanlan is a walking example of that. There would have been a time, she admits, when she would have had to move away to be able to establish her fashion label. But the internet has changed all that and Scanlan, 35, has been able to build her business and raise twin boys in the city of her birth.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a supportive place. I have a huge support network in Dundee. I opened the shop a year and a half ago and it\u0026rsquos just been unbelievable. Seeing strangers walking down the street wearing my clothes \u0026hellip I can\u0026rsquot even put it into words.  Today the V\u0026ampA Dundee opens. Next month, Mike Galloway retires. It\u0026rsquos time to hand on the reins to someone else, he says. Walking me back to the elevator, he points down the estuary where three oil rigs can be seen. \u0026ldquoWe started looking at decommissioning a couple of years ago and we got laughed at. Now we\u0026rsquove got some major companies looking to base themselves in Dundee for this emerging new industry.  For Galloway this is a new beginning for Dundee. This is a city with problems, some of them huge and grievous, but progress is being made. In the future the city will look dferent, will be more confident, erse and complex, he hopes.  If so, that will bring its own problems of course, Galloway admits.  \u0026ldquoIt will be interesting 20 years from now to see  people are moaning about the number of tourists."},{"url":null,"title":"what-can-we-do-about-the-scourge-of-jobsworths","story":"  I\u0026rsquove been trying to cut down recently so it was going to be a treat. Sad as it sounds, I\u0026rsquod been anticipating it all day.  Ah, let me check my purse. Darn it, I\u0026rsquove only got \u0026pound2.23.  She suggested I have a cup of tea for \u0026pound1.80 instead. I wasn\u0026rsquot after a cup of tea and certainly not for \u0026pound1.80.  \u0026ldquoYou could go along the street to the cash machine. I had a taxi on the way and not much time.  So, my coffee was lost for want of a 2p piece.  I did eight years\u0027 labour in a coffee shop and I can tell you this much, I would have made the 2p up.  \u0026ldquoJobsworth, I whined to the taxi driver, all the way back to work in a funk.  My barista jobsworth absolutely pales in comparison to the hard graft put in by a manager of a Toby Carvery who denied a terminally ill woman a small plate.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos right. The rules of a chain roast dinner restaurant are sacrosanct. One must take what one is given and be glad, even when one is dying.  A woman in Merseyside visited her local Toby Carvery and asked for a child\u0026rsquos plate. Lynn Deer has terminal stomach cancer, resulting in most of the organ being removed. She hasn\u0026rsquot, you\u0026rsquoll sympathise, much of an appetite.  Child\u0026rsquos plates are for the under-12s and there will be no exceptions. She tried to show the manager a medical card but the lady in charge was not for turning. I tell you what, I didn\u0026rsquot expect to spend my Wednesday afternoon in a minor Twitter spat with Toby Carvery but the chain\u0026rsquos pathetic, mealy-mouthed non-apology left me seeing red. They appreciate my feedback.  Jobsworths are the scourge of polite society. What can we do about them?  In this instance, staff cannot be taught empathy but they can have disability awareness drummed into them, so let\u0026rsquos hope\u0026nbspsome staff training is afoot.  Good customer service matters so much because bad service is to steal someone\u0026rsquos time. It\u0026rsquos a mini manslaughter \u0026ndash who among us has time to give away? You are taking a little piece of someone else\u0026rsquos le.  Ma Stewart was a bit stressed about catching her train the other week and, because of her hearing loss, didn\u0026rsquot realise she was shouting at the station staff member.  Instead of taking umbrage, the ScotRail worker helped her through the barrier, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquoYou go with her, allowing me on to the platform without a ticket and without me having even asked.  What a dference it made, that small, thoughtful gesture.  We have an increasingly elderly population, a society that is increasingly moving online. It seems odd to me that my older neighbour won\u0026rsquot set up a direct debit for his council tax but, on reflection, it\u0026rsquos a day out to pay it in person with guaranteed human interaction.  Imagine that you\u0026rsquore a person\u0026rsquos only face-to-face connection that day and you make them feel bad, you rattle them, you deprive them of something they were excited for.  This all resonates so much because I was once that jobsworth. Back in my coffee shop days, while I\u0026rsquod have let you off with coppers, I was as compliant with company policy as they come.  We\u0026rsquod been told not to give cream in coffee because it curdled. I mean, it doesn\u0026rsquot, does it? But what I was told, I believed.  Every morning the back of 6am a taxi driver would come in for his coffee with cream. Would I give him it? Would I coco.  When he insisted, I would give him a cup with an 80/20 split \u0026ndash in favour of the cream.  I shudder now to think of how he must have dreaded to see me. An irritating little madam setting his day off to a tense and fat-laden start. I am filled with shame.  I saw him not that long ago on Sauchiehall Street and wanted to chase after him to apologise. Of course, that would have been awkward for him and serve only selfish me.  So what changed? Maturity, mainly. But for many jobsworths, age is no excuse.  How to encourage everyday kindness to strangers? I think it starts small and spreads, as mawkish as that may sound. Send it out in waves, each little act at a time.  But it\u0026rsquos vital to go in at the top. Our current insecure labour market does nothing for the discouragement of jobsworths. The pressure is twofold:  your work is precarious, why care? And  you\u0026rsquore at risk of a short term contract being renewed, there\u0026rsquos no incentive to risk using your initiative and overriding company policy.  So, be kind, complain and compliment. Be kind to staff but complain furiously to companies that implement ridiculous policies. And compliment where a job\u0026rsquos well done.  Jobsworths can be overcome common sense must win the day."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-closing-in-on-brexit-deal-with-brussels-suggests-raab","story":"  The Brexit Secretary issued a statement following an \u0026ldquoextended phone call this morning with Michel Barnier about the latest progress both sides\u0026rsquo teams had made on the Withdrawal Agreement and the framework for the future relationship.  \"While there remain some substantive dferences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship, said Mr Raab.  \"Looking ahead, we agreed to review the state of play in the negotiations following the informal meeting of heads of state or government of the European Union in Salzburg next Thursday, and we reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.

Together Karen Darke and Ken Talbot have become Scotland\u0027s newest world record holders - in hand-cycling.  Both speed feats were performed while sat inside Arion4 an enclosed hand bicycle pod designed by engineering students from the University of Liverpool in which the riders only see the road on a screen.  Whether it is hand-cycling across the Himalayas, sit skiing across the Greenland ice cap or travelling or climbing the 3,000-foot clf El Capitan in Yosemite, Inverness\u0027s Karen Darke is in her element.    But the 47-year-old\u0027s latest escapade with Mr Talbot set against the golden yellow sand carpet of the semi-arid Nevada desert is far away from the extreme adventures she has devoured - and has amazed some of her closest colleagues.  This time it is about human powered bicycle speed racing and even watching it is not easy.  The instructions for spectators on the desert plateau spell out the dficulties - limited parking and no services and warnings that warm clothing is needed for the cold of the mornings and evenings.  On two consecutive days as the sun came up on Nevada State Route 305 she broke the female hand-cycle land speed record not once, but twice over the flat 2.5 mile course. And in so doing she even managed to surpass an old men\u0026rsquos world which had been standing for seven years. In her velocipede on Wednesday morning she set a speed of 41.86mph - 17mph faster than the previous world record.    Pictures by ULV team  But she was merely warming up, because on Thursday morning she added nearly 5mph to her own mark with a speed of 46.05mph.  Before the arrival on American soil, the arm powered male world record was 45.68 mph and was set in September 2011 by Greg Westlake from Avos Arrow. The female world record was a mere 24.85mph and was set in September 2016 by Sarah Piercy from Plymouth University.  It is, perhaps, apt that Ms Darke who was victorious for Great Britain in hand cycling at the 2016\u0027s Rio Paralympics, should complete the feat near the quiet town of Battle Mountain, dubbed \u0027the town that gold mining saved\u0027.  \"I surprised myself,\" she said Ms Darke, who admitted that she \"freaked out\" when first trying out the enclosed bike she described as \"like an egg\".      \"It is one of the most surreal experiences of my le, because to sit in this pod and crank it up that highway, because I have never done it before, well it feels pretty extreme,\" she said. But it did not end there, as Mr Talbot who with Ms Darke are part of the University of Liverpool Velodipede team broke the men\u0027s record and became the first hand-cyclist to go over 50mph in history with a time of 51.86mph.  Mr Talbot, who got into hand-cycling ten years ago had his training disrupted for a week and a half because of flu but said: \"When I was a little kid, I wanted to be one of the people who went up there and set a record.\"    Both were taking part in the 19th annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge where teams from France, Russia, Japan, Canada, Italy, Mexico, USA, the Netherlands and Britain, bring their high-tech pedal powered bikes to achieve amazing speeds.  The high altitude and arrow straight section of road has attracted athletes worldwide to test their speed bike designs and sprinting abilities since 2000.  The thin air at 4,619ft altitude reduces aerodynamic drag, which coupled with the five mile long acceleration zone enables the bikes to reach their maximum velocity before being timed over a 200 metre distance.  For Ms Darke, this was an interlude in her latest adventure, Quest 79, a project to undertake a total of nine hand-bike rides on seven continents while raising money for charity and encouraging others to take on their own challenges.    \"After Rio I was looking for a new challenge and I heard about this event and I just fancied it,\" she said. \"This was the first time the University of Liverpool had produced a hand-powered bike so I went to visit them and basically said I want to be your female rider. And they said it was okay.  \"I never sat in it until a week before I came our here when I had a few runs on an old runway somewhere near Manchester. So I was on a big learning curve and it was such a surreal experience to be sat in, basically, an egg. It\u0027s very very dferent to riding a regular hand-bike.  \"The first time I tried it on the first day I freaked out. I did go fast but your senses are completely altered. It is so noisy inside and all you can see is the road on a screen. It\u0027s not the actual road.  \"You are just adjusting to everything, the dimensions are dferent, there\u0027s no window, your depth of field is distorted, there are so many things that are new. It has hardly any steering so  there is a gust of wind it blows you off and it is hard to correct it.\"    She was 21 when she fell about 33 feet off a sea clf while rock climbing in Scotland, breaking her skull, arms, neck and back. After three days in a coma, she woke up and was told she was paralysed from the chest down. She\u0027s been in a wheelchair ever since.  Her first expedition after her accident was a hand-bike ride along the Silk Route from Kazakhstan to Pakistan in the Himalayas in 1997 and others followed.  \"Why do I do these things? It\u0027s like trying to say why you are the way you are. I like challenging myself. I like adventures. I like the whole experience that it brings of meeting people and having new experiences and new encounters.  \"Le is to be lived and experienced and that\u0027s what I like to do.\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"snp-members-criticise-campaign-fronted-by-partys-public-finance-minister","story":"  A motion to be tabled at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference raises concerns over the impact of banning single-use plastic straws.  Kate Forbes, who was promoted in Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos recent reshuffle, has pushed for the UK and Scottish governments to outlaw plastic straws in a bid to boost the environment.  But the SNP\u0026rsquos Aberdeen Central branch appeared to take aim at her \u0026ldquoFinal Straw campaign.  Its motion said it \u0026ldquowelcomes initiatives to reduce and remove the unnecessary usage of any single-use plastics.  However it notes a \u0026ldquocomplete ban on single-use plastic straws would directly harm disabled people and jeopardies their independence.  It adds: \u0026ldquoConference proposes that guidelines be established for any environmental legislation or policy, ensuring that disabled people are not unfairly disadvantaged by well-meaning but harmful campaigns, and further proposes constructing policy which focuses on finding innovative solutions to plastic waste which target the real dangers instead of stigmatising or excluding disabled people.  Ms Forbes wrote to the Scottish Government earlier this year requesting \u0026ldquoalternatives to plastic straws are recommended before any ban is brought into force.  It came after a disability group called on her to pause the Final Straw campaign while concerns are addressed.  In her letter, she insisted: \"It is important that the needs of disabled people are fully considered as we look to protect our environment for future generations.\"  The Skye, Lochaber \u0026amp Badenoch MSP is widely seen as one of the SNP\u0027s rising stars."},{"url":null,"title":"john-swinney-branded-odd-over-school-testing-demonstration","story":"  The Education Secretary wrote to every MSP in Holyrood in a bid to defend standardised assessments for primary one pupils.

Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos education spokesman Iain Gray branded Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos latest move \u0026ldquodesperate.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe idea that civil servants performing the tests to MSPs is in any way equivalent to the pressure felt by a four-year-old sitting them is utter nonsense.  \u0026ldquoIf John Swinney truly wants an informed debate he should listen to the calls from teachers and educationalists who say the tests are useless, or the parents of traumatised children who do not trust them.  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the offer was \u0026ldquoodd.  He said: \"I am much more interested in what teachers and parents have to say about these tests than I am in watching John Swinney\u0027s civil servants push buttons on a screen.  \"Teachers, campaigners and EIS Scotland have lambasted these tests as a waste of effort yet the Education Secretary is point blank refusing to listen.  \"The clock is now ticking down until Parliament votes to scrap them. The only question left to answer is whether John Swinney will then do the right thing and change course.\"  Next week\u0026rsquos vote is expected to be brought forward by the Scottish Tories.  While a Holyrood defeat would not be binding for the SNP Government, it would be politically dficult to ignore.  The literacy and numeracy tests have sparked a huge backlash from parents, teachers and unions since they were brought in last year.  Children are assessed in P1, P4, P7 and S3 to help teachers judge their progress, but there have been claims some five-year-olds have been reduced to tears.

VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important.

I’d put my phone on silent and forgot to turn it back on.                                                    “So they called Philippa and said I needed to get to the hospital in Edinburgh.        “My brothers said they were going to wind me up on our wedding day or honeymoon so I thought they were just kidding on.“But when I checked my phone, I had a lot of missed calls from a mobile number.                                       \t      \t\tWe Need Everybody...is the message from Organ Donation Scotland during Organ Donation Week 2018, from September 2 to September 9. The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a le-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were ing.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my le so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney  had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his le and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a le as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my le had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some dficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new le.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the dference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gt that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a le free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gt – enjoying le to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive dference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new le basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gt.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my le and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gt.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure for post office","story":"        Kemnay Post Office will close temporarily from the start of next month.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles. It takes two hours and 49 minutes to drive the 115 miles from Lochinver in the south-west to Wick in the north-east.\u0026ldquoMy constituency covers 3675 square miles. We could fit all 73 London constituencies in my constituency, and have room left over around the sides.\u0026ldquoThe proposed changes are simply an example of the Boundary Commission running mad and it undermines democracy.\u0026ldquoWith the best will in the world, it is very hard to cover the communities within my constituency, even when driving hither and thither.\u0026ldquoThe point is that constituencies and communities have a right of access to their elected member.\u0026ldquoDespite doing what I hope is my best,  there is a shortfall in what I can do in terms of reaching out, why would I not suggest that there is a slight democratic deficit?\u0026ldquoWhen an idea is stark raving bonkers, like this one, it just has to be said loud and clear.\u0026ldquoI will, of course, contest the seat at the next election. I may not hold the seat, as I may be voted out, but whoever represents the seat will have a very dficult time representing those good people  the constituency gets any bigger.SNP MSP Gail Ross, who holds the Holyrood seat of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, stated that the proposed changes were unacceptable even though they could in theory help her party to win Mr Stone\u0026rsquos seat.\u0026ldquoThat will be up to the electorate but I would rather we win a seat by having a good candidate and policies that appeal to voters than because the seat has been given extra territory, she said.\u0026ldquoI share Jamie\u0026rsquos concerns as my own ward for Holyrood is a massive challenge for me to get around it.\u0026ldquoDespite all the technology in place, such as Skype and WhatsApp, you need to visit all the parts of your constituency to see what is going on and to properly speak with constituents face to face.\u0026ldquoI have colleagues who hold seats in urban areas who are shocked by the amount of travelling I have to do to meet and listen to constituents.\u0026ldquoWe need more representation and smaller wards so that the electorate can be properly served by their MP and MSP.\u0026ldquoAs for the proposed name change of the Westminster seat to \u0026lsquoHighland North\u0026rsquo, that will see Caithness taken off the political map.\u0026ldquoIt will also be name that\u0026rsquos misleading as to how big the constituency is.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage. It has been a delight to watch Hope develop into a self-assured and confident young lady who is always keen to represent the views and opinions of young people from Orkney and beyond!”Jack Norquoy said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m absolutely delighted to be part of the panel to represent the work of SYP, young folk in Orkney, and crucially help to ensure we see a progression, not a regression of young people\u0026#8217s rights in Brexit.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business. The support and encouragement I have received from the team has really helped me to progress my business.\"\u0026nbspTo enter, apply online at www.createhighland by October 31.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 4:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 28-year-old comic, originally from Fe, who now lives in Edinburgh, has made an international impact since streaming of two of his stand-up specials, Dark and Jigsaw, started on Tuesday on Netflix.            The shows have resulted in him trending across much of the globe.             Now he claims that people are getting in touch saying that his show is responsible for their break-up.Speaking to the Daily Record he said: “The joke is 20 minutes long and was never intended to break couples up. It’s just a joyous effect of it.“It’s a love letter to single people, pointing out that most of the time being single is better than being in a relationship.“Turns out it resonates with people so much they’re dumping their s*** partners.“Before Netflix, the tally was 500. It’s now more than 2500 – and those are only the confirmed numbers, people who have messaged me.            “I wouldn’t be shocked  it was four times higher.”And many fans have taken to Twitter to inform him of their situation and break ups since watching. One fan tweeted: “I wanted to say you can add a orce from a three-year emotionally abusive marriage to your list.“I just finished watching your show and I was having doubts about whether or not I had made the right decision.“However, the questions and situations you brought up confirmed that it’s OK to say that I deserve better.”            Despite some of the positives, the comic admitted that not everyone is so understanding saying: “A bloke threatened to punch me in Edinburgh last year. He said, ‘I bought my girlfriend and her best friend tickets to your show. She came back and dumped me and said, ‘Ask Sloss’, so what the f***?’”Although Netflix never give out viewing figures, the success of Sloss has not gone unnoticed, with a huge billboard along Sunset Bouled in Los Angeles erected since his show started streaming. Daniel, who did his first stand-up show aged 17, said seeing his face on one of America’s most famous streets was “weird and amazing”.He joked: “I have no idea why people say success is humbling. So far it has been nothing other than an ego boost, which I did not need.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4798321.1536691774!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment what toddlers talking like apes says about humans","story":"        After Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, Victorian cartoonists had a field day.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nSaturday 15 Sep 2018 4:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment ing from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit.

This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8634679.1536854663!/image/image.jpg","title":"council flag tribute to emergency services","story":"\nA flag has been raised at Mid and East Antrim Borough Council buildings to celebrate the work of all emergency services as part of 999 Day.\n\n                \nIt is part of the National Emergency Services Memorial charity campaign to help raise £2 million for a new national cenotaph dedicated to public servants.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAn emergency services flag was hoisted by council and representatives from the PSNI, NI Fire \u0026amp Rescue Service, and the Mayor’s official charity, Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe first citizen, Cllr Lindsay Millar, said: “It’s an honour for council to help celebrate all the hard work of all our emergency services.

To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread  AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my we and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This signicantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountul fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautul, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these dferent organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the dference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit mps call for action to help northern ireland fishing fleet","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We heard pleas for increased quota and action to alleviate crewing shortages in the Northern Ireland fleet.\n\n\"The Government\u0027s fisheries white paper is a step in the right direction, but more detail is needed on how quota allocations will change. \n\n\"The industry also needs to be reassured that the Government will be ready to support them in the unlikely and undesirable event of no deal.\n\n\"The Government must now take action on Ireland\u0027s unilateral suspension of the Voisinage Arrangement and on the long-running dispute over Lough Foyle.\"\n\nThe Voisinage Arrangement allows for mutual access to Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland vessels up to six nautical miles off the coast of each country.\n\nSince Brexit there has been considerable debate between politicians on both sides of the border over who should have the right to use Lough Foyle.\n\nDr Murrison continued: \"We found an industry in Northern Ireland with great people and huge potential, but it is fragile.\n\n\"Changes to quotas and access to waters aren\u0027t enough. We must develop infrastructure to support the Northern Ireland fishing fleet, find crews for boats and enable fishing businesses to sell into Europe post Brexit.\"\n\nThe report\u0027s findings were welcomed by Alan McCulla, chief executive officer of Kilkeel-based fisherman\u0027s co-operative Sea Source Ltd and the Anglo North Ireland Food Producer\u0027s Organisation.\n\n\"It\u0027s very encouraging to see MPs very engaged and having a genuine interest in the fishing industry,\" he told the Belfast . \n\n\"Fishing is one of the few industries that has the very real potential for a tremendous idend from Brexit. We\u0027re especially pleased to see there has been a call for access to properly qualied and experienced crew.\n\n\"We\u0027ve seen an escalation in the \u0027scallop wars\u0027 between the UK and France recently, but it also has to be recognised that Dublin has been excluding Northern Ireland fishermen. The Voisinage Arrangement has been suspended in Ireland since 2016 and we need Dublin to engage on this issue and end the impasse.\n\n\"Then we need to look at infrastructure in the industry in Northern Ireland. Given the current political situation, we\u0027ve had no one here making decisions for the past 18 months at a time when major decisions need to be made. \n\n\"Brexit will happen, but there\u0027s no way we will be able to maximise the potential benefits it will bring unless we act now.\n\n\"It\u0027s ironic that the Republic of Ireland has been investing heavily in port infrastructure when they could be the losers. In Northern Ireland we are behind the game and I\u0027d encourage London to progress urgently.\"\n\nFor Mr McCulla, the only disappointment in the report is the failure to mention the Hague Preference, a mechanism designed to adjust national fish quota allocations to take account of the needs of certain fisheries-dependent areas in northern parts of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\"The existence of it was a main reason why we saw 92% of the Northern Ireland fishing industry vote to leave the EU.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed  the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105  the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause signicant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and dfered substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes,  a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mla kelly seeking answers over who tipped off photographer about howells visit to grave of father","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And from that we have to ask, why was it being kept a secret at all?\n\n\"This is a case that was of signicant public interest at the time and has been since. It\u0027s very high profile. The Department of Justice has had a few knocks over the past couple of weeks and should be taking whatever steps necessary to restore public confidence.\"\n\nHowell\u0027s father Samuel passed away on July 21 and he did not attend the funeral service, which was held at Portadown Baptist Church on July 28.\n\nA source told the Belfast  his visit to the grave lasted just over an hour and he was accompanied by prison officers.\n\nHowell is currently serving a 21-year jail term for the double murder of his we Lesley  and Trevor Buchanan , the RUC officer husband of his then lover Hazel Stewart. Their bodies were found in a fume-filled garage in Castlerock in 1991.\n\nPolice originally thought the pair had died in a suicide pact after discovering their partners were having an affair.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service declined to discuss his release, saying it \"does not comment on inidual cases\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland inquest delays 80 hearings on just","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It has had 14 preliminary hearings.\n\nIssues around legacy continue to deeply ide Northern Ireland\u0027s political parties.\n\nAlthough the Stormont House Agreement includes a £150m package to deal with all legacy issues, the Government has said financial resources will not be released until political consensus is reached on dealing with the past.\n\nThe families of those killed at Kingsmill, one of the most shocking crimes of the Troubles, have faced the greatest number of delays, with 35 preliminary hearings.\n\nRepublican terrorists stopped a minibus carrying a group of 10 Protestant textile workers, ordered them off the bus, lined them up and shot them at the roadside in January 1976.\n\nThe atrocity has been attributed to the Provisional IRA, but no one has ever been convicted over the murders. Only one man, Alan Black, survived, despite being shot 18 times. An inquest into Kingsmill was held at the time but a fresh one was ordered at the request of the Attorney General in 2013.\n\nIt opened in 2016 and has sat periodically, with a number of preliminary hearings also taking place in that time.\n\nColin Worton\u0027s brother Kenneth was among the 10 textile workers gunned down during the roadside ambush.\n\nHe said: \"Over 42 years on, we would like to have been much further ahead in our quest for justice.\" Mr Worton said his mother, Bea, who is almost 91, is also deeply distressed by the ongoing delays.\n\n\"She often wonders  she will get answers in her letime, but things only seem to be dragging on.\n\n\"At the end of the day,  any truth comes out of this it may open other doors for a conviction. However, you have to be realistic that  anyone is ever going to be convicted, they may only serve around two years in jail.\"\n\nFamilies of those killed by the Army in Ballymurphy in August 1971 have attended 22 preliminary hearings.\n\nTen people were shot during three days of gunfire involving members of the Parachute Regiment. They included a priest tending to those wounded and a mother of eight. Another man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nLast month their families expressed anger at an \"11th hour\" disclosure by the Ministry of Defence - seven days before an inquest was due to start.\n\nThe last-minute discovery of a database - documenting details of 4,733 soldiers who had been serving at the time of the 1971 shootings - delayed the latest hearings which were due to start on September 10. A new hearing date has been set for November 12.\n\nJohn Teggart, whose father Daniel was among those killed, says families are still hopeful of one day getting to the truth of what happened to their loved ones.\n\n\"Year on year, we are losing more and more eyewitnesses and family members, but it\u0027s down to the determination and hard work of the families that we have got to this point,\" he said. \"However, every time there\u0027s a setback, we feel the hurt.\"\n\nThe Stalker Sampson case has had 27 preliminary hearings. Six men were killed in late 1982 in three separate incidents which became the subject of the Sampson/Stalker report, carried out by two senior police officers, Colin Sampson and John Stalker.\n\nTeenager Michael Tighe was shot on November 24 IRA members Eugene Toman, Sean Burns and Gervaise McKerr were shot on November 11 and INLA members Roderick Carroll and Seamus Grew on December 12.\n\nInquests into the deaths have been delayed for many years. The Stalker/Sampson reports have never been made public.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united ireland would permanently reduce living standards of those in republic","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Please Nicola, sound the bell. Fire the starting pistol.\n\n“Please Nicola Sturgeon, you’ve done a good job so far, put yourself at the head of this campaign … and on the 7th of October in Glasgow’s SECC please stand up and ignite the passion across Scotland by announcing loud and clear we’re going to use the mandate.”\n\n\nIt’s happening! \npic.twitter/Ks5BBU2lKK\n\n— Hope Over Fear  \nSeptember 15, 2018\n\n\n\n\nOther speakers at the event included Western Isles SNP MP Angus MacNeil and former Scottish cabinet minister Alex Neil.\n\nMr Neil said: “The time has come for us to go out and evangelise how much better le would be  we make our parliament an independent parliament.”\n\nHe said a “very minimum of 55%” of independence supporters was needed to ensure winning the second referendum.\n\n“I pledge myself, and I hope everyone here pledges themselves, to do everything we need to do in the next month and the next few years, to get Indyref2 and to win Indyref2.”\n\nCampaigners had planned to show the film Braveheart at the start of the rally but the screening did not go ahead.\n\nIndependence campaign group Saor Alba organised a march to the event and the group’s George Kempik said the turnout at the rally had been “disapointing”, but vowed they would continue.\n\nHe said: “I have children and grandchildren, and for me this is about them. I’ve been fighting for independence since the original referendum for devolution in Scotland in 1979 and nothing I’ve seen then has ever changed my mind.\n\n“The rallies are just a reminder to everybody.

Unless we address these issues, we are simply storing up problems for the future.”\n\nMr McDonnell said that the possibility of quitting the EU would be disastrous for the economy and that a Labour government’s number one priority would be securing a deal.\n\nHe said: “Consistently now, we’ve been meeting with business leaders, trade union leaders, representatives from the city, asset managers and bankers, I met with representatives from Goldman Sachs last week, all the messages are the same – ‘Get a deal that protects jobs and the economy’, and  they can’t, the message is ‘move aside. We’ll do the negotiations’.”\n\nIn his speech, he renewed Labour’s 2017 election pledge for a transaction tax between financial institutions and the establishment of strategic investment pot for banks and business leaders to work with government to generate wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nProtesters lead the calls for financial reform \n\n\n\n\nHe added that Labour would crack down on legal tax avoidance, saying: “In the last general election people accused me of having a magic money tree.\n\n“Well, I’ve found it – it’s in the Cayman Islands. We’re going to dig it up and bring it here.”\n\nHe continued: “[To banks] the message is this – you will get a decent rate of  but we are not going to be ripped off any more – ripped off by speculation, privatisation, job cuts and exploitation of workers.”\n\nThe event was organised by pressure group Change Finance and Positive Money, and among the speakers were Zita Holbourne, of civil rights group Barac UK, and Green MEP Molly Scott Cato.\n\nAlso among the speakers was SNP MP Kirsty Blackman, who boasted of her party’s reforms to welfare, taxation and social housing.\n\nShe said: “In Scotland,  you look at what’s happening, even with one arm behinds its back – because the Scottish Government doesn’t have all the power – you can see what a government on the left can actually do.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"here are the embarrassing childhood things that people thought were really cool","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This is what Don Pino Puglisi teaches: he lived to spread goodness.\n— Pope Francis  \nSeptember 15, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPuglisi was declared a martyr by the Vatican and beatied in 2013, the last formal step before possible sainthood.\n\nFrancis paid tribute to the priest, who worked to keep unemployed youths in a poor neighbourhood of Palermo from turning to local Mafia bosses for jobs like pushing drugs. \n\nThe papal pilgrimage came amid revelations about priests and bishops who sexually abused children or connived to protect the abusers in ious nations.\n\nTens of thousands of people cheered Francis at an open air Mass held in the late morning at an esplanade along the port city’s waterfront.\n\nA large banner carried by young people in the crowd as Francis was driven by in his white popemobile read “Let’s renew the church”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPope Francis is driven through the crowd as a large banner reading ‘Let’s renew the church’ is visible \n\n\n\n\nPressure is building on Francis to say what he knew about the sexual misconduct of US prelate Theodore McCarrick, who was recently stripped of his cardinal’s rank by the pope.\n\nFrancis drew applause as he told the crowd: “If the Mafioso litany is, ‘you don’t know who I am,’ the Christian one is ‘I need you.’ If the Mafia threat is ‘you will pay me,’ the Christian prayer is ‘Lord, help me to love.\u0027”\n\n“Thus I say to the Mafiosi: change, brothers and sisters. Quit thinking about yourselves and your money,” Francis continued in his homily.\n\n“You know, a funeral shroud doesn’t have pockets. You can’t take it with you,” Francis said of organised crime’s ill-gained wealth from drug and arms trafficking, extortion and betting and prostitution rackets.\n\n“You give le to others, not take it away. You can’t believe in God and hate your brother, take away le with hatred,” Francis said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry couple raise 5000 neo natal unit help talented tattoo","story":"\nA Derry couple have raised over £5,000 in aid of the hospital unit that saved their twins’ lives with the help of a close friend.\n\nBob and Michelle McLaughlin daughters Saorlaith and Saoirse received le-saving care at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit , where they were looked after in 2016 after they were born prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication.\n\nThe girls arrived six weeks early and suffered from ‘Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome’ in the womb, where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.\n\nThey were nursed back to health by the staff at the Neo Natal unit and their parents have held a charity walk for the past two years to raise money to say thanks.\n\nThis year family friend Michael Kelly offered to hold a fundraising event at his tattoo parlour to help boost their donation.\n\nIt soon mushroomed into a huge family fun day at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park and rock night at the Delacroix which both took place on Saturday.\n\nMr Kelly was joined by a team of tattooist from across the north who managed to ‘ink up’ 120 people with specially designed tattoos.\n\nThose who got tattooed included parents whose children had spent time in the ward and even three members of staff.\n\nMr McLaughlin got two designs himself- a purple ribbon, which is the symbol of prematurity awareness, and a set of footprints surrounded by a heart shaped stethoscope to pay tribute to the care given to his daughters at the hospital.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“It was a really excellent day,” Mr McLaughlin told the Derry News.\n\n“I couldn’t even have imagined that so many people would turn up and show their support from all over the city and beyond.\n\n“A lot of people had personal reasons for being there and personal reasons behind the tattoos that they choose.\n\n“There was one woman who got a tattoo in memory of her grand child who had sadly passed away in the NNICU, so there were a lot of really emotional stories.”\n\nAwareness\n\nMr McLaughlin thanked everyone who helped make the fundraising event such a huge success.\n\n“It means the world to us that Michael decided to do this for our family and that he and all his staff and visiting tattoo artists gave up their time for free,” he added.\n\n“It is something we will never forget.

and Strabane District Council’s Business and Culture Committee voted in favour of the promotion of the plans, which will see high end food on offer at city centre off street carparks.\n\nHead of Business, Kevin O’Connor, presented a report to the committee seeking approval of the pilot project in Derry and Strabane.\n\nMr O’Connor said the street food markets would complement Derry’s existing Walled City Market, which brought over 99,000 visitors to Guildhall Square during the five monthly markets from April to August of this year.\n\nHe told members Councils’ business team are currently

regarding use of this space outside Council led events,” he said.\n\nMr O’Connor said the council has operational management of off street parking and can readily make this available for the promotion of street food trading.\n\n“The use of off street parking for trading has been tested recently with Foyle Street Car Park being used to deliver Oktoberfest which proved to be very successful,” he

have seen the owners of a restaurant in the city centre banned from erecting a shelter at the front of the premises.\n\nThe application came before the September meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee seeking approval for the installation of three external retractable awnings to part of the front façade of the Custom House building at Custom House Street in Derry, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, a planning officer said that advice had been received from the Historic Environment Division  that the installation would have an ‘adverse affect’ on a number of listed buildings within the area, including Custom House, the Harbour Commissioners Office, Harbour Square and The Guildhall.\n\nThe meeting was told that the HED were of the opinion that the proposal would result in ‘unnecessary damage’ to the historic structure. \n\nThe officer added that while the plans before them had been amended from a previous application, the awnings would still ‘obscure the windows to a certain extent and remain inappropriate on a building of this style and character’.\n\nThe meeting head that a precedent had been set by the nearby Guildhall Taphouse bar, formerly the Monico Bar, another listed building which mow has an awning over a seated area.\n\nHowever, the Historic Environment Division said the building was ‘of a dferent style’.\n\nThe planning officer advised local councillors refuse the application on grounds that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’ as it would have an adverse effect on the character of Custom House and the setting of the surrounding listed buildings.\n\nThe meeting then heard from a representative of the applicant, Kular Fashions, who said that the contractor chosen to carry out the work are the ‘best in the UK’ and would carry out the work in a ‘delicate’ manner which would have ‘no impact on the structure itself’.\n\nHe added that the awning would bring ‘le and people’ into the space and said buildings are ‘not antiques’ and should be ‘inhabitable’ whether it is sunny or raining.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

applicant also assured councillors that the awning would not contain any advertising.\n\nDUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said there are a ‘strong trio’ of buildings in the area and she didn’t want to interfere with their architectural integrity.\n\nCouncillor Dan Kelly, of Sinn Féin, said the awnings would provide shelter for street entertainment and believed that tables on the streets was part of the ‘direction of travel’ in the city. \n\nHead of Planning with council, Maura Fox, said it is a ‘balancing act’ and she was ‘very much in favour of retaining listed buildings’. \n\nSDLP councillor Tina Gardiner said she would be supportive of the awning  it was ‘tasteful’ and made reference to their widespread use on historic buildings in London. \n\nUsing the Guildhall Taphouse as an example, she said it made the space visible and attracts ‘le and vitality’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin Cllr Patricia Logue said, the buildings may become ‘vacant and derelict’, but agreed that they should contain ‘no advertising’. \n\nHowever, the SDLP’s Gus Hastings believed awnings didn’t serve much purpose and would only encourage ‘outside smoking’ and therefore wouldn’t be supporting it.\n\nEleven councillors voted in favour of the awnings and two against, meaning the advice of planning officers was ‘overturned’.\n\nThe meeting was told that the matter would come back before the council next month.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"stendhal festival dates already set","story":"\nThe dates for the Stendhal Festival 2019 have just been released.\n\nOrganisers have said: “With Stendhal festival 2018 proving to be another record breaking year for organisers of the Limavady based, multi-award winning music and arts festival, it has not taken long for thoughts to turn to next year.\n\n“Indeed the dates have already been set for the ninth instalment of Stendhal Festival which will take place next year at Ballymully Cottage Farm on August 15, 16 and 17.\n\nThe event will once again be a three day affair, with the addition of an extra night having been so warmly received this year and the organisers are already looking forward to trying to top what they have hailed as their best year yet.”\n\nAnd, Event Director, Ross Parkhill said: “For us 2018 was incredible.\n\n“We had approximately 8500 people on site, up approximately 2000 on 2017, which made the event last summer the largest independent music and arts festival of its kind in the history of Northern Ireland and that that just blows my mind.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize

to do so again, which means we have quite the job on for 2019.”\n\nLooking ahead Ross said that the team are already in the early planning stages for what will be the ninth instalment of Stendhal and that he hopes that next year will be a case of solidying as much as growing the event.\n\n“At this stage we are aiming more towards solidying the event and tweaking bits and pieces than we are for massive growth,” he said.\n\n“If we can manage to get 9000 on site next year, we’d be more than happy with that and then we’d look towards breaking the 10,000 mark for our 10\nth\n anniversary in 2020. That said, I do think that we would be more than capable of managing a crowd of 10,000 next year  things went really well.”\n\nRoss concluded: “It’s a crazy amount of work that goes into just one weekend in August but we love every minute of it and continue to be incredibly grateful and humbled by all the love and support we receive from everyone.”\n\nA limited number of Early Bird tickets are available for Stendhal 2019 now on StendhalFestival.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"voice people north needs heard european parliament post brexit says derry mep","story":"\nThe voice of the people of the north needs to be heard in the European Parliament says a Derry MEP.\n\nSinn Féín MEP Martina Anderson has called on the Irish government to allocate its two additional European seats to the north.\n\nSpeaking in the European Parliament in Strasbourg Martina Anderson said: \"The north of Ireland should continue to have representatives in the European Parliament post Brexit.\n\n\"Independent legal advice demonstrates that its legally permissible and possible for the Irish government to create a new constituency for the north and allocate its two additional seats to it.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n\"Out of 28 member states, 22 afford nationals not resident in their Member State the right to vote in European Parliament elections.\n\n\"Currently Ireland deprives us living outside the jurisdiction that right to vote.\n\n\"With less than 200 days before Brexit the people of the north will suffer most and decisions taken in the EU will continue to impact on our lives.\n\n\"Strong voices from the north of Ireland are needed in this Parliament post Brexit so the Irish government need to act now and ensure that our democratic rights are upheld by allocating the two additional seats to the north.\"\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"young film maker calls derry support john hume entry international competition","story":"\nA Media Production Management student at Dublin City University has called for the Derry support for her short film in an international competition on one of the city’s most-loved sons, peacemaker, John Hume.\n\nGráinne Golligy, a 27-year-old student from County Meath, said she chose the former Derry man and former SDLP leader for the work she submitted to JCS International Young Creatives Award on the theme ‘Stand Up for Peace’ due to the ‘amazing work he did for peace in Northern Ireland’.\n\nHer video is called, \n‘We Shall Overcome’\n and can be watched and voted for on this link:\n\n\nhttp:upload.iemmys.tv/YoungCreatives/Public/Default.aspx\n\n\nGráinne said: “I have worked in many areas of media over the past six years and I was invited to enter the JCS Young Creatives Competition by the International Academy of Television Arts and Science using the theme ‘Stand Up for Peace’. \n\n“John Hume stood out for me in this theme time after time as he not only stood up for peace and contributed to the Northern Ireland peace movement but devoted his le to it. \n\n\"He set out to accomplish the impossible, to bring peace to the people of Northern Ireland, and to obtain peace in a respectful manner.

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is ided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style mot. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date. As the two rings from Bright dfer little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement. If the rings were in circulation for a reasonable  of time it is even possible that they could have been owned and eventually lost by the castle\u0026rsquos occupants.\n\nMeanwhile, a fragment of Viking \u0026lsquohack silver\u0026rsquo, dating back to the ninth or 10th century, has been discovered near Drumbo.\n\nExperts say the piece, which is less than 2cm in , would originally have been part of a larger item such as an arm ring or bracelet.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Scientist elected as international council member  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA CARRYDUFF scientist has been awarded membership of a prestigious international body for food science and technology.\n\nProfessor Margaret Patterson has been elected as one of the seven council members of the International Union of Food Science and Technology .\n\nIUFoST represents more than 150,000 food scientists and technologists in over 60 countries throughout the world.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

million, agents Lisney and Osborne King have confirmed.\n\n                \nLocated on the corner of Donegall Square South and Linenhall Street the 70,000sqft of Grade A office space has been acquired by a private property trust for a sum described as “well in excess” of the £21m asking price.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDeveloped in 2003, the nine-storey building boasts a strong line up of tenants including Capita, News Letter owner Johnston Publishing and Yell, in addition to two levels of underground car parking.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“This deal rounds off a very busy summer period for us and the price achieved represents a great result for our client,” said Nicky Finnieston, investment director at Lisney.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“The office sector in Belfast presents a great opportunity for investors and as such, the level of competitive demand for this asset was not surprising.”\n\nWith strong occupier demand and signicant rental growth in recent years, he said the market was busy and exciting.\n\n“This is our second large office investment sale of the summer having sold Obel 68 in July and we have seen a very erse investor base look at these assets, a considerable positive for Belfast.”\n\nPaul Henry, director of Osborne King said: “The process has yielded an excellent result with active competitive bidding.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The sales evidence is some of the strongest on record. With the Belfast office market having seen prime rents move from £15 per square foot to £21.50 over recent years the new purchaser has an excellent platform in the  to exploit its considerable reversionary potential.\n\n“The  Building is located in the heart of Belfast, the opportunity to purchase a building of this quality in this location doesn’t come along very often and we were delighted to have been involved in the sale.”\n\nBDO Northern Ireland were advisors to the purchaser.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch

Arlene Foster\u0026#8217s former adviser claims proves he did not try to delay RHI cost controls actually was an attempt to make changes which would have continued vastly lucrative subsides, the RHI Inquiry has been told.\n\n                \nReturning to the public inquiry for a sixth and final day of questioning, Andrew Crawford – the man who was at Arlene Foster’s side for almost all of her ministerial career – faced an intensely forensic examination of his conduct.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nYesterday the inquiry focussed on the DUP man’s deep and extensive contacts with Northern Ireland’s monopoly poultry processor, Moy Park – including the fact that three of his close family members who sell to Moy Park have between them 11 boilers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr Crawford admitted that by mid-2015 “I knew there was nothing to stop people running boilers 24/7 and getting paid for it...I could see how people could do that”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHowever, he said he had “no knowledge” of actual abuse happening.\n\nDr Crawford has denied the allegation of fellow former DUP Spad Tim Cairns that he acted in the background to delay cost controls in the summer of 2015, at a point when the scheme was already known to be beyond its budget.\n\nCentral to Dr Crawford’s defence is an email which he sent to Mr Cairns on July 31.\n\nIt began: “I think that you will have to make changes from the 1st October as the system at the moment has no upper limit to the amount of support.” \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, the inquiry has revealed how the proposal which Dr Crawford then went on to make in that email as to what should happen on October 1 would have meant that many of the heaviest RHI users would have barely,  at all, worse off even after the scheme was changed in the way he suggested.\n\nThe inquiry’s technical assessor, energy expert Dr Keith MacLean, put it to Dr Crawford that his proposal to allow RHI boiler owners to double the size of boilers eligible for the most lucrative tarf under the proposed cost controls, and then to increase the number of hours which they could claim that top rate from 1,314 hours to 3,000 hours, meant that his proposal would not have reined in the out of control scheme.\n\nHe said: “On the basis of fairly simple arithmetic, it seems that what you’re proposing is actually a way of maintaining exactly the same income for the poultry industry that they were having before because what you’re saying is that currently there are 99kw boilers that they’re running for 6,000 hours but under the new regime, because the band is being doubled up to 199kw, they would then run for half the hours.”\n\nHe said the proposal would mean that they “would therefore maintain exactly the high income that was driving the behaviour that you have described that allows them to heat houses when they’re empty. Was that your conscious motivation for putting forward that?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe DUP man said that he was not saying that his proposal was “sound”, based on what he now knows, but that “there was a clear rationale” for it.\n\nHe said that he met boiler installer David Robinson in a chance encounter on the farm of his brother who was installing boilers, and was told that an average poultry house requires 16 hours of heat a day and that he had based his calculations on that number.\n\nHe said that he believed his proposal would “stop the rush of people coming in before the changes were taking place”.\n\nDr MacLean said: “Of course you would –  you give them just as much money as before.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “What you would be doing is stopping people then running the boilers 24/7.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt that point, inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin intervened. He said: “What this is is a sales pitch for Moy Park.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “No, it’s not. I don’t believe so.”\n\nSir Patrick cut him off, saying: “Hold on. Let’s read it: ‘If a Moy Park producer puts in a 199kw boiler, he can expect to run it for 3,000 hours’.”\n\nThe retired judge went on: “We’ve already got the warning before that some people are running boilers [in] empty sheds for 6,000 hours.\n\n“But this is for Moy Park – not for that [abuse]. ‘From these calculations you will see that Moy Park producers will be in a rush to refit their houses. If you increase the step from 1,314 to 3,000...’ Why 3,000? Because 3,000 is what Moy Park need. Now, unless you have, Dr Crawford, a really helpful reasoned explanation, that is what you have put in English in your email.”\n\nDr Crawford replied: “In terms of what [was in the email], it’s not my knowledge at that time [was that] it took the 3,000 hours to heat a house – not to heat it when it’s empty it’s to heat it when there’s a crop in the house.”\n\nWith obvious exasperation, Sir Patrick interjected: “Exactly. But that’s what Moy Park need or want or told you.”\n\nDr Crawford said that the previous night he got an email which talked about poultry having the highest heat need and he recalled the conversation with the boiler installer.\n\nSir Patrick put it to him: “You’re the man who originally recommended setting up a meeting with Moy Park you’re the man with the relations, all of whom worked for Moy Park in this email of yours Moy Park are the only people who are identied as requiring 3,000 hours. \n\n“Now, it’s a simple proposition: What you’re saying in this is...we have to stick by 1st October...there is nothing in there that doesn’t refer to the 3,000 hours being attributable to Moy Park’s needs.”\n\nThe DUP man said: “I believe  I had spoken to Moy Park, I would probably have came [sic] back with a figure that was below that...it goes back to: What is possible to get this through the [Assembly] committee?”\n\nSir Patrick said that the ministerial submission passed to him talked about putting in a limit of 1,314 hours, the same as in GB. He said: “What you’re saying here is: There is a special interest here, and that is the poultry interest, and Moy Park need 3,000 hours.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “What I was doing was putting a proposal on the table – or not even a proposal, a suggestion on the table – to try and allay Timothy Cairns’s concerns so that he could get the submission through.”\n\nSir Patrick asked: “Or for the benefit of the industry?” \n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, it’s what was the art of the possible...”\n\nDr MacLean said the panel was not disagreeing with him that his proposal would have made it much easier to get acceptance of the cost controls “because a big group that would object and would lobby MLAs would be perfectly happy with it” and there would be no spike in applications because “by giving them all the extra money and keeping the level of the money as it was before there would be no reason to rush to get into it”.\n\nDr Crawford then argued that his proposal would have stopped the extreme abuse of the scheme because those running boilers around the clock would no longer have an incentive to do so.\n\nSir Patrick said: “All right. Why not go for the limit suggested [from GB]?” The DUP man replied: “Because it goes back to the first two points that Dr Maclean was making...”\n\nWith an exasperated laugh, Sir Patrick interjected: “Because you wanted to sell it to the poultry...”\n\nDr Crawford said: “No, no. I didn’t want to sell it to the poultry industry. I wanted to make sure it could be delivered through the committee.”\n\nIn January 2017, internal Moy Park emails show that the company was tipped off by Andrew Crawford that RHI was to be shut – prompting the company to rush to install as many boilers as possible, and giving it a head-start on rivals.\n\nWhen asked about the meeting where he alerted the company to the looming change, Dr Crawford was vague, saying he did not clearly recall what had happened and suggested it may have been a passing reference to coming changes.\n\nThe meeting occured just after he became Spad to the then-finance minister Mervyn Storey, but the meeting was not in the ministerial diary and there are no minutes.\n\nSubsequently, senior Moy Park figures internally discussed how to rush through as many applications as possible how they could look at “any influence we can exert” to “soften” the proposed closure. One suggested they should “go up and see Dr Crawford”.\n\nInquiry counsel Joseph Aiken asked yesterday: “Did they come and see you?” Dr Crawford said: “I don’t recall”\n\nHe said he could not be sure and added: “I would have met Mike Mullen and other people from Moy Park on a frequent on a fairly regular basis.”\n\nAround that time, Dr Crawford and Moy Park again feature in the story.\n\nThe DUP man admitted that he deliberately removed from a crucial document which went to Executive ministers a reference to the fact that the poultry industry had driven the spike in RHI applications.\n\nThe submission was part of the Executive’s urgent procedure to close the scheme completely in February 2016 and Dr Crawford’s actions meant that the information going to other ministers was incomplete.\n\nWhen asked why he took it out, Dr Crawford admitted that the information “is accurate” but said it “wasn’t solely the poultry industry” responsible for the spike.\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked Dr Crawford to “think carefully... about any inference that the panel should draw in relation to your removal of this entry, given your family circumstances and your frequent talks to Mr Mark of Moy Park”.\n\nDr Crawford disputed that he had “frequent” talks with Mr Mark and said “it is not in relation to any inference in relation to my family”, adding that as a former DETI Spad he had a role in encouraging Moy Park’s growth.\n\nHe went on to say that “singling out Moy Park”, before correcting himself to say “the poultry industry, sorry”, was something that was “unfair”.\n\nSir Patrick said it was “undoubtedly true” that Moy Park had a key role in the spike and asked: “Why remove a true fact?”\n\nDr Crawford said “it was the inference that was being created at that time”.\n\nSir Patrick said: “It’s not an inference. That’s what I’m trying to get at with you. The major responsibility for the spike was the poultry industry, and Moy Park in particular. If that was true – and it was – why remove something that was true?”\n\nDr Crawford said: “My concern was the narrative that it was creating.”\n\nUnder intense questioning about his actions and motives, Sir Patrick eventually said: “All I’m trying to do, Dr Crawford, is trying to give you the fullest opportunity to explain something that I think you are unable to explain otherwise.”\n\nDr Crawford said he had “concern about the wider implications for the sector – the sector that employed a large number of people in Northern Ireland” – but insisted there was “no malice” in what he did.\n\nDr MacLean highlighted that it contradicted an earlier warning from Dr Crawford that a “tsunami” of applications was going to come because of Moy Park.\n\n\u0026gt\u0026gt\u0026gt Andrew Crawford is a crucial witness and over the course of six days, he faced rigorous questioning – made more rigorous because he repeatedly said “I cannot recall”, “I’m at a loss to know how that conversation went”, “I don’t know”, “I can’t say” and similar phrases, writes Sam McBride\n\nThe DUP man was unable to explain his role in many key developments in which he was, or is alleged to have been, involved.\n\nAs well as Dr Crawford’s signicance to the inquiry’s search for the truth about what happened with RHI, there is also a political signicance to what has emerged about how he acted.\n\nArlene Foster appointed Dr Crawford to a role where he had delegated authority, acting on behalf of the minister, and therefore she is accountable for his conduct.\n\nHis fate will impact on her own.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n

of Gliders in east Belfast compared to buses.\n\n                \nMy analysis found that between 8am and 9am the number of seats on offer between Knock and the city centre had plunged from around 900 to around 400.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe overall capacity was down a bit too, from around 1,100 to around 1,000. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Gliders have much more standing room than the old double deckers, hence the way in which seating provision is radically down but total capacity is only slightly down. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThis means that hundreds of people every day are standing for long periods when previously they sat all the way in and all the way home.\n\nTranslink and its defenders point out that standing was always going to be a feature of the Gliders, because it is a rapid transit system. But there is a huge flaw in this logic.  \n\nPassengers are now standing at rush hour from, usually, somewhere between Stormont and Knock all the way into the city. From there it still takes about 30 more minutes to get into the centre.\n\nSo that is like the London Tube you might think? It is often so crammed that it has to leave passengers at a station until the next one comes. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut the Tube has a huge In-Out ‘churn’. It might be full for three stops then largely empty, then fill up again. Seats keep coming free.\n\nThe Glider is not like that. Once it fills up heading into Belfast, very few people get off.\n\nThus, as one furious reader wrote this week, people are routinely standing for 30 mins, never having stood on the route before. \n\nSometimes in London you have to stand 30+ mins. Sometimes. On some routes at some times, often.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut London is a mega city. Belfast is not.\n\n\n• Ben Lowry  is News Letter deputy editor\n\n\nBen Lowry Sep 14: \n\n\nCrammed Glider service in east Belfast has far, far fewer peak-time seats than the old buses did\n\n\n\nBen

mathematics professor at Oxford University, the Co Armagh man has made a name for himself off-campus by taking on some leading atheist figures in public head-to-head debates,  expounding and justying his own Christian faith.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

before a live audience in London on July 18, and the debate was then posted on video-sharing website YouTube on September 7. Since then it has been watched about 18,000 times – and here the News Letter takes a look at the spirited-but-civil clash.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCentral to Prof Lennox worldview is this: “Faith is part and parcel of my le as an intellectual and a scientist. And my Christian faith consists, not in faith as a leap into the unknown, it is evidence-based commitment.”\n\nQuoting fellow Ulster intellectual CS Lewis, Lennox said: “Men became scientic because they expected law in nature. And they expected law in nature because they believed in a law-giver.”\n\n\n   \n                  with \u0027Prof Michael Ruse  and compere Justin Brierley\" title=\"Prof John Lennox  with \u0027Prof

of Christian faith who largely drove it, noting that 16th and 17th centuries thinkers looked on the world as a “machine made by the ine engineer” as they sought to unravel it. But as time went on scientists “retired” God, dropping Him from consideration.\n\nBirmingham-born Prof Ruse’s backround is Quakerism, but he began to lose faith at around age 21 and today tends towards agnosticism.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRuse said  the universe was indeed designed, then “you

/\n                   \t\n      \t\t\nProf Michael Ruse \n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nAnd turning to the question of morality, Ruse asked about the existence of evil – why, for example, was it more important to allow Heinrich Himmler his free will than to save the le of Anne Frank?\n\nLennox agreed the question of evil is an extremely hard one, but said atheism has no good answer. Because whilst it might offer a form of explanation – that the universe is just pitiless, with no justice, and that’s all – it offers no solution for “the suffering and the pain”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’d sit where you sit Michael,  I didn’t believe in the final judgement,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think Himmler is going to get away with it... and when we see what God eventually does with the Anne Franks of this world, we mightn’t have such severe questions.”\n\nThe crucixion of Christ shows that “God hasn’t remained distant from this problem”, and offers us “grounds for hope” he said.\n\nAt another point, he also declared that he believes literally in Gospel miracles such as water into wine.\n\n“I don’t believe it broke the laws of nature,” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“This is God feeding a new event in – the laws of nature can’t say anything to that.”\n\nRuse said: “I just feel John that you’re reducing the Gospels to the level of Grimm’s fairytales. Let me be rather rude about this – I think you’re downgrading a tremendously important story to one of David Copperfield.”\n\nDespite his academic focus upon reason and evidence, at one point Lennox cautioned against the “dangerously false” idea that “science is the only way to truth”.\n\nHe also cited the experience he and others have had of testing what  Christ has promised in their own personal lives  – namely peace and a “new power” – and finding that it passed the test for them.\n\nCompering the event was Christian radio host Justin  Brierley, who spoke to the News Letter afterwards.\n\nAs to who won the debate, he said: “We didn’t do a vote to see where the audience felt the best arguments lay.\n\n“Possibly it might be fair to say the atmosphere in the room felt like probably they were more favourable in the end to John Lennox’s view.”\n\nThe debate was part of a series organised by Premier Christian Radio called ‘The Big Conversation’.\n\nIt has also included figures such as Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, Anglican minister and radio/TV presenter Richard Coles, Australian philosopher Peter Singer, and illusionist Derren Brown.\n\nTo watch to the
