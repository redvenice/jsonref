(Picture Getty)Fifty-six million years ago, the Earth warmed far above the temperatures we experience today – and ice at the poles melted.It sounds like the kind of crackpot conspiracy to be found on ‘ancient alien’ UFO sites, but scientists have seriously investigated the idea.Professor Adam Frank of the University of Rochester writes in The Atlantic that the investigation could offer insight into how to find alien life – or about our impact on our planet.Frank writes, ‘There is a conundrum here. If an earlier species’s industrial activity is short-lived, we might not be able to easily see it.‘The PETM’s spikes mostly show us the Earth’s timescales for responding to whatever caused it, not necessarily the timescale of the cause.Could we be one of several civilisations to have lived on Earth? (Picture Getty)‘So it might take both dedicated and novel detection methods to find evidence of a truly short-lived event in ancient sediments. In other words, if you’re not explicitly looking for it, you might not see it.’Frank says the researchers thought about what our civilisation might leave behind in rocks for future civilisations to find – plastics in the ocean, evidence of fertiliser use, and (most of all) evidence of fossil fuel use.Frank says that civilisations might – through their collapse – trigger the conditions to create more fossil fuels, for future civilisations to use.Frank says, ‘Our work also opened up the speculative possibility that some planets might have fossil-fuel-driven cycles of civilization building and collapse. If a civilization uses fossil fuels, the climate change they trigger can lead to a large decrease in ocean oxygen levels."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7621136.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"wetherspoon close 900 pubs head offices social media accounts trolling","story":"The company feels that social media does little to enhance the businessJD Wetherspoon is closing down its Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for all its 900 pubs and head office with immediate effect following the trolling of MPs and others.The pub chain said the move also takes account of recent concerns over the misuse of personal data and the addictive nature of social media.Alfie Evans\u0027 parents lose legal fight to move son to Italian hospitalWetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said: ‘We are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business.‘I don’t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.‘It’s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion.‘We will still be as vocal as ever through our Wetherspoon News magazine, as well as keeping the press updated at all times.Teen survivors of Manchester bombing to share their experience on anniversary of attack‘We will also be maintaining our website and the Wetherspoon app and encourage customers to get in touch with us via our website or by speaking with the manager at their local pub.’Wetherspoon has more than 44,000 Twitter followers and more than 100,000 followers on Facebook.Its most popular posts have received more than 500,000 views."},{"url":null,"title":"When Kate Middleton birth","story":"    Kate, Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s third pregnancy was confirmed by Kensington Palace in 2017When did Kate announce her pregnancy?Kate’s pregnancy was confirmed by Kensington Palace in September 2017 in a statement that said: ‘Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child.\u0027The Duchess was forced to make the announcement early after suffering from severe morning sickness, otherwise known as hyperemesis gravidarum, as she did during her first two pregnancies.After taking a short hiatus from public engagements, Kate returned to royal duties at the start of 2018 and sported her bump visiting west London’s Reach Academy Feltham that works with the children’s mental health charity Place2Be.

The ceiling had rotted out above my bunk bed, which meant the drainage from a bathtub was leaking onto me. I survived on power bars that my dad would send me, he\u0027d smuggle them into me through the lining of a case, which was stuffed with them.\u0027I had to constantly clean asbestos and pipes damaged in the boiler room, situated in the tunnels underneath the LA headquarters. There were three boilers the size of two-story houses, then five or six smaller ones, all completely wrapped in asbestos. I was only 16 years old and working on eight-inch steel pipes, welding thousands of yards of steel pipes at that age, it was absurdly dangerous.\u0027After one year at RPF in LA, I got transferred to finish off at Flag. I was remodeling a lot of the hotel rooms, but then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse.\u0027To this day, Cruise, 55, still has his own suite on the top-floor of the Scientology-owned Osceola Inn, which is dedicated to his own personal taste.Tighe says: \u0027On every other floor at the Osceola, there were seven or eight hotel rooms, but he had the whole floor. It was British colonial style. There were two four-poster beds, all African mahogany, hand made plantation-style shutters 8ft tall.           At 12 years old Tighe (pictured in 2005) signed a billion-year contract with the Sea Org and endured 18-hour days of hard labor and studying  Brendan was punished and sent to the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) - a Scientology prison - and forced to do hard labor           After one year at RPF in LA, Tighe was transferred to finish off at Flag and then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse (pictured) \u0027Built-in, custom-made, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, two giant 8ft by 12ft wide entertainment systems and bead-board ceilings. They\u0027d also put up special satellite dishes for his TV. The penthouse had triple the amount of cameras than anywhere else, often disguised as smoke alarms.\u0027After Tighe had finished RPF in 2002, he was approached by the deputy security chief who gave him a position at The Sandcastle, a Church-owned hotel mostly used by public Scientologists, who were visiting Clearwater HQ for courses and auditing, and Scientology VIPs.The Sandcastle security control room, where Brendan worked, monitored most areas where Scientology VIPs studied and lived, including Travolta and Cruise\u0027s personal quarters. From 2004, Brendan became the head of security at The Sandcastle until he left five years later.The Top Gun actor would often stay for months at a time, along with his huge entourage, and complete the \u0027Operating Thetan Levels\u0027, the highest of Church studies.\u0027I wasn\u0027t his personal bodyguard, that was a guy called Algar, but for seven years in a row, I was doing his security detail, such as guarding him when he walked down the street and would be checking all the cameras in his living area. I was a top priority with the dentist, I always had to have my teeth whitened and regular check ups. You had to have a good smile for Tom Cruise,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Five of us were ordered to get gun licenses out of 47 security, we\u0027d have a gun strapped to our legs, it was specifically for Cruise and Miscavige. It was amped up when the protester group called Anonymous started in the early 2000s.\u0027In all those years, I think he said hi to me three times, even though I\u0027d be in the hotel every single day. When you see him glad-handing everyone in videos, he never did that at Flag, he kept to himself. Even if he was on a course with 200 people, he\u0027d have a three-person security buffer from anyone.     Brendan doing security at an International Association of Scientology Gala circa 2007          Sea Org Day in 2005           Flag Building, the global headquarters for Scientology in Clearwater, Florida\u0027You\u0027d hear that he would travel to obscure Scientology Orgs and shake their hands, but it\u0027s just photo occasions, he\u0027s not like that. He had to have everything private, every detail. I found that odd.\u0027His routine would be - wake up, gym for an hour, then breakfast of all kinds of \u0027shakes, lots of food and protein, all sent to his room by his personal chef, who was one of my close friends called Nico. He just liked bacon and eggs and protein shakes. Then he\u0027d gym again before the day is out. When he would go to exercise, he would want the entire gym wing all to himself.\u0027He\u0027d then go to study, including auditing sessions and refresher courses, he\u0027d be constantly in the classroom. Cruise was a perfectionist and would hang around for several weeks even after being allowed to go, as he wanted more auditing, more courses.\u0027It was beneath Cruise to have his own hotel card, so we had to make sure that he could go through all these doors and they would open and close perfectly. There\u0027s hundreds of doors, with magnetic locks and punch codes. If it took him 30 seconds to go down a hallway, no one else was allowed to use it, same with any public areas and even the urinals. If anything was out of place, like someone had pissed on the floor, Cruise would tell the security. Sometimes it would get back to Miscavige, then someone would really be in trouble.\u0027He had his own private jet so he could go in and out without anyone seeing, Miscavige also got granted use of it. We\u0027d know weeks, if not months, in advance if he was coming, he never just popped in for a day or two.\u0027There were times where he\u0027d have to do movie reshoots during his coursework, but he\u0027d be straight back, or they\u0027d even do it locally very secretly, where directors and producers would meet him at Flag. All his movies fitted around Scientology. The only person he did have time for is Miscavige, and the pair would ride around Clearwater on their motorbikes or go to the movies.     Brendan had befriended Cruise\u0027s mother Mary Lee, who converted in the mid 2000s           While working as the PR officer for a fundraising unit he invited Mary Lee to an awards banquet. Above is her thank you letter to Tighe          Invitation to Brendan to start the Operating Thetan Level 2 - there are eight levels in Scientology, which followers study and it costs a lot of money\u0027When I witnessed it for the first time, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, they were putting on their motorbike gear on a public street, in full view of everyone. They\u0027d then drive to the movies, which they\u0027d do a lot, I don\u0027t know how no one ever noticed them. They\u0027d then ride back, talk for an hour by the road, then go their separate ways,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Cruise emulates Miscavige in every way.\u0027But it was his relationship with children Isabella and Connor which stuck with Tighe. Nothing got in the way of his studies, family was second to Scientology, The kids would even stay in different lodgings.\u0027Although he was at the Osceola, he\u0027d rent a few rooms at The Sandcastle for his staff, Isabella and Connor, and their teachers and caretakers. I never, ever saw him with his kids apart from one time in 2007 when it was his birthday on the 4th of July. I don\u0027t want to paint a bleak picture, but I was watching hundreds of cameras and I never saw them with him. They\u0027d even be making faces into the cameras.\u0027 \u0027They would be taken to amusement parks, do schooling in their hotel rooms. I heard staff talk about how they constantly had to make sure that the kids were on Cruise\u0027s side. By the mid-2000s, Cruise, who came from a strict Catholic upbringing in Louisville, Kentucky, had converted his mother Mary Lee to Scientology, and his three sisters - Cass, Marian and Lee Ann - they were all working for him in some capacity.          Cruise is the only one with a \u0027direct line\u0027 to leader David Miscavige (pictured), Tighe claims \u0027Cruise\u0027s mom was always there at Flag, she was a lovely woman, we would talk for hours sometimes, she was so nice. His mom always remembered my name. I would feel safer talking to her when Cruise wasn\u0027t in town, I wouldn\u0027t want to get caught by him. \u0027She was getting lots and lots of auditing and was very happy about it, she was so proud of her son, she was the sweetest woman in the world. My take on it was that he was still a mommy\u0027s boy, but his sisters were under his thumb.\u0027After I left security in 2009, I was the PR officer for a fundraising unit and organized an awards banquet and show. Mary Lee was personally invited by me and sent me a thank you letter.\u0027The two-sided letter said: \u0027Beings of this universe, The entertainment was great, the food was great, the table decor was great could have danced all night. Much love, Mary Lee South.\u0027Yet Tighe tells a different story about his sisters and Cruise\u0027s attitude to them. \u0027He wanted all his sisters and their children at the same super high level as him, being super dedicated Scientologists and not dragging him down in anyway. \u0027They would work for him either in management or housekeeping, but, in talking to his family, it was always about making him happy.\u0027Nothing was left to chance with Cruise and when he orced from Nicole Kidman in 2001, it was leader Miscavige\u0027s chief aim to find him a girlfriend.          Tighe said he had met church member Kirstie Alley several times. He also claims to have helped Kelly Preston get a birthday gift for TravoltaTighe would also accidentally get the reports on Cruise\u0027s latest brainwaves, who would then make handler Davis fire off a note to Miscavige. In a Scientology promo video from 2008, Cruise was interviewed about what the Church means to him, and he\u0027s seen laughing on camera. The clip went viral and Tighe says Cruise wanted the clip played continuously on Scientology TV, which he wanted created just for him.\u0027Tommy would get slapped around for the littlest thing that Cruise was not happy about. Tommy was the buffer between Cruise and Miscavige, Miscavige would never directly deny any Cruise\u0027s requests, but usually they\u0027d go through Tommy, who\u0027d then have to handle it delicately,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027For example, after he got the Freedom Medal, in one of the reports, it said that Cruise wanted to create a TV network on Scientology. He was so pumped up about his medal that he wanted them to create a video of the ceremony, then play it 247 on some new channel he wanted. \u0027He wanted the full interview, the one where he\u0027s laughing his a** off, on the TV network, he thought it was the best thing ever. Tommy had the worst task of having to tell him we couldn\u0027t do it.\u0027When Cruise eventually settled down with Dawsons Creek actress Katie Holmes, 39, and they had a daughter Suri, now 11, security proved even more difficult. \u0027Cruise and Katie would be super competitive, they\u0027d race down opposing stairwells to get to the gym, silly things like that to see who could run there faster.\u0027Scientology and him was always first, without a doubt.\u0027Katie was always nicer to us than Cruise. Cruise never said: Hey, I know you work hard behind the scenes for us. Just never happened. Whenever she was there, she\u0027d get giant amounts of Cold Stone ice cream for us, she wanted to make sure all the staff got something behind the scenes."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/10/4B14CE4600000578-5617539-image-m-2_1523784441050.jpg","title":"Meghans family left dark royal wedding invite","story":"    A 19-year-old Meghan Markle is pictured on her paternal grandmother Doris\u0027s 85th birthday in Florida, USA           Meghan Markle on her high school graduation day, accompanied by her father Thomas MarkleOne of Meghan\u0027s uncles reportedly said: \u0027I talked to Thomas last week and he didn\u0027t seem to know what the problem was.\u0027He told me he hasn\u0027t heard anything and he didn\u0027t even know if he would be walking Meghan down the aisle.\u0027 The newspaper says the family are waiting to find out if the \u0027controversial behaviour\u0027 of some of Meghan\u0027s relatives has left them frozen out of the wedding. Meghan\u0027s nephew is a CANNABIS farmer who is planning a new...Did Meghan and her ex split up over a pasta dish?

But he failed to call UK Prime Minister Theresa May in the early stages of the operation, giving the French leader the opportunity to claim France is America\u0027s leading ally in Europe.  Vladimir Putin condemned Friday\u0027s strikes as an \u0027act of aggression\u0027 that will worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and have a \u0027destructive influence on the entire system of international relations.But Trump has vowed to carry out more if Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime dares to use chemical weapons again.

Today Mr Corbyn demanded a \u0027war powers\u0027 law to ban the Prime Minister from taking military action without a Commons vote.The official legal advice claimed \u0027the UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering\u0027. Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow. Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, the Labour leader replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.\u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. \u0027That surely would save a lot of lives,\u0027 he told the Andrew Marr Show.  The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons  Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesSome 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing. Assad continues to deny using any chemical weapons, telling visiting Russian politicians today that Western air strikes against his country were accompanied by a campaign of \u0027lies\u0027 and misinformation at the UN. But in response to the deaths, scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night.The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Centre which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program.The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by 22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles. The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities. Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack.

We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over.

It was mission accomplished,\u0027 White said on Saturday, repeating President Trump\u0027s tweet earlier in the day.Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria\u0027s suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, \u0027Mission Accomplished!\u0027 - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.\u0027The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,\u0027 Pence told reporters, noting there were \u0027no reported civilian casualties.\u0027He also had a warning for Russia: \u0027Our message to Russia is, \u0027you\u0027re on the wrong side of history,\u0027 \u0027 Pence also said. \u0027It\u0027s time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. \u0027You\u0027re known by the company you keep.\u0027Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown.

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed.

They fled to safety through an upstairs passageway leading to their newsagents shop in Waterfoot, Lancashire.The couple, who are President and President Elect of Rossendale Rotary Club, later discovered their employee Hitchin was behind the fire after he was spotted on CCTV.Hitchin, of Newchurch, had been telling fellow villagers he \u0027hated\u0027 the Watts after they were obliged to declare his cash in hand payment to benefits officials.He was jailed for three and a half years after he admitted arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered at Burnley Crown Court.          Hitchins tried to torch the home of Adrian Watts and his wife Caroline after developing a grudge against them following the benefits cutIn a statement to police Mr Watts, a grandfather who has run the newsagents store since 1985 said: \u0027One of the most upsetting details was finding out Neil was telling people in the local community how much he hated us. It has taken us four weeks to get our house back to a liveable state and we are exhausted.\u0027There have been some nights where I have dreamt of being trapped in a burning building. \u0027Had they not had smoke alarms then the outcome could have been a whole lot worse. I became an unhappy and angry man snapping at people for minor issues.

He did a good job, he worked seven days a week and we increased his wage when he had to pay tax.\u0027We did everything we could for him. At the time I would never have said it was Neil, I didn\u0027t think that he had that sort of spite in him.\u0027You just can\u0027t compute how somebody could do that to you. We used to get on really well. I was just incredulous and disbelieving. But the fact is he had a grudge while he was still working for us. If we hadn\u0027t had a smoke alarm we wouldn\u0027t be here now.\u0027  The couple who were targeted said they couldn\u0027t believe Hitchin had become so consumed by the pay issue. Left: Victims Adrian and Caroline Watts and his wife. Right: Mr WattsThe court heard Hitchin had been employed by Mr Watts for five years, delivering newspapers in the area. He was paid cash in hand for his work.Prosecutor Richard Archer said: \u0027At the same time was claiming benefits and did not declare this. Mr and Mrs Watts properly declared the money they paid their staff through the books and the job centre became aware of his employment. He was interviewed about this and as a result his benefits were reduced.\u0027He continued to work there but felt aggrieved. He spoke to a friend of his and told him of plans to fire bomb the job centre - but commented that he would need to cover his face as there was CCTV. After a while he switched his intentions to the newsagents as he blamed the Watts for his change in circumstances.\u0027This was more a personal vendetta than a commercial one. He didn\u0027t target the newsagents but the house next door where the Watts were sleeping.\u0027          Hitchin had been delivering papers for the newsagents for five years before the arson attackHitchin had a previous 2006 conviction for harassment. His lawyer Anthony Stephenson said in mitigation: \u0027A clear diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome has been given in this regard. What compounds the circumstances in this case is that this is a man who had formed an almost siege mentality.\u0027He is remorseful and regretful. He never intended to harm but just to scare or frighten. He had formed an incorrect view of his part-time employers and thought they were dead set against him. When he was in drink and at a low ebb he committed the offence for which he stands here today.Sentencing Hitchin, Judge Jonathan Gibson told him: \u0027There was a significant risk of harm because you put accelerator through the letterbox late at night. If the smoke alarm wasn\u0027t working the consequences could have been a lot more severe.\u0027Luckily they managed to get out of the house via a back stair case. There was significant psychological harm when they reflected on what happened. You do have a previous conviction which shows an obsessive type of behaviour.\u0027This offence was committed in drink and was an attack as a result of ill-feeling and more than one person was endangered.Hitchin was also made subject of a lifetime restraining order banning him from contacting Mr and Mrs Watts.

Konstantin, from Moscow, said: \u0027So our team has been in many different places - I\u0027d say we have come through both ice and fire, but this trip to Baikonur was the toughest in all the senses of this word.\u0027 Pictured: His team standing at the base of the rocket in Baikonur, with metal platforms rising to the top on either side           The ageing spacecraft are kept in the enormous Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is based in a Russian enclave deep within Kazakhstan\u0027s desert steppe. Baikonur was the world\u0027s first and largest space launch facility, with both Sputnik 1 (the first artificial Earth satellite) and Yuri Gagarin\u0027s Vostok 1 (responsible for the first manned spaceflight) launched from it. Now the facility is home to two shuttles that sit gathering dust after the termination of the Buran Space Program in 1993. Pictured: Two members of the team stand on one of the abandoned craft, which is literally gathering dust           Konstantin said: \u0027I hope our story will be interesting for everyone and I will be invited to work in Roskosmos - I like to photograph spaceships. Also I need to say that as a result of this trip we decided to build our own rocket - which is what we are actively dealing with now. It was a long way ahead - only a little bit shorter than to Paris. There were a lot of interesting things to see (with no tickets, special tours, approvals and so on) and of course adventures.\u0027 Pictured: A small doorway at the spaceport           His five-man team journeyed 15,500 miles in total from their Moscow starting point and had to turn off their headlights to avoid being seen by guards. Konstantin said: \u0027Baikonur is 2500km from Moscow. Going there by car is the cheapest and easiest way. The plan was as easy as the following: using offline maps - we wanted to get by car as close as possible in the desert then leave a car and walk through the sand towards the buildings of cosmodrome\u0027. Pictured: The spaceport, photographed from the long grass on its periphery           Describing his journey, the photographer said: \u0027We didn\u0027t want to be seen from the cosmodrome - that\u0027s why we drove with the lights off, sometimes using portable torches to light the way. But soon the car got stuck and we had to continue walking - we still had about two days before the launch. We were heading towards the biggest workshop on the territory of the cosmodrome.\u0027 Pictured: A rocket they found at the base           Konstantin said he used many of the old buildings to hide from detection. He explained: \u0027All those abandoned buildings were just a perfect place to hide. There were many places not to be noticed or found by the cosmodrome workers\u0027          Two large buildings at the base were photographed at night, with the starry Kazakh desert sky bright overhead. Konstantin described the secret mission as an adventure           During the final leg of the journey - a walk - it was hard to remain hidden, he said, explaining: \u0027It took us about 6 hours to walk 22km - and it was a point when we saw the buildings of the cosmodrome, then we had to move like partisans in order not to be seen and we still had to walk 4-6 km to get to the point.\u0027 Pictured: Their prize, an abandoned shuttle           The team of adventurers also climbed into the space shuttle and took photographs of the cockpit, which contained many of the original dials and toggles           The audacious snaps were taken by Konstantin Kosmodemiansky, a blogger and photographer from Moscow who trekked 17 miles through the desert with his friends in order to capture the bizarre scene          The ageing shuttles reside in a massive spaceport that sits alone, miles from any other settlements.

In Stalin’s World: Dictating the Soviet Order, Sarah Davies and James Harris reconstruct his claustrophobic, insular reality through a close study of his archive, shining a spotlight on the daily business of running a massive totalitarian state. It paints a portrait of the dictator as monstrous, paper-shuffling super-bureaucrat.RJB Bosworth takes a very different approach in Mussolini’s Italy. Via an astonishing accumulation of detail, he immerses the reader in a reconstruction of daily life under the fascist dictatorship. The results are surprising: I did not know that a quarter of Italy’s Jewish population were members of the National Fascist Party by the 1930s, nor that Topolino (Mickey Mouse) was regarded as a corrupting influence on Italian youth. And yet Mussolini’s own children read comics starring the American rodent even in Il Duce’s own household, his political experiment was a failure.Stalin’s World is very dense and Mussolini’s Italy is very long – common characteristics of books about dictatorships. Simon Leys’ Chinese Shadows has just over 200 elegantly written pages, and yet cuts to the heart of Mao’s Cultural Revolution with precision. Leys exposed the destructive evil of Mao’s regime at a time when “useful idiots” ranging from Jean-Paul Sartre to Shirley MacLaine were singing its praises in the west. His narrative fuses insights from his own travels in China with profound but lightly worn erudition. One moment Leys is discussing Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse‑tung, the next he is reaching back to its 14th‑century precursor, the Ming Ta kao.Latin America has endured many tyrants, spawning the genre of the dictator novel. Of all the celebrated examples of the form, I am most fascinated by Augusto Roa Bastos’s I, the Supreme. The 1974 novel provides a fictionalised account of the 19th- century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco, AKA Dr Francia, AKA “the Supreme”, who ruled the nation between 1814 and 1840. The Paraguayan author’s interest in the Supreme was not purely historical Bastos wrote the novel while Paraguay was suffering under another dictator, Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda. However, the book is no simple allegory, it is also a profound meditation on power and language.And now for something completely different: Riad Sattouf’s The Arab of the Future. We know personality cults are strange, but that strangeness looks different from the perspective of a child. Sattouf experienced both Gaddafi’s Libya and Hafez al-Assad’s Syria while still a small boy. Kids don’t spend a lot of time reflecting on totalitarianism, but they do form strong impressions. His simple depictions of living in an almost-abandoned building for expatriates in Libya, or of watching Assad praying on TV are the kind of banal micro-details that would lose their significance in written prose. Captured in the panels of a cartoon strip, however, they attain a luminous resonance that lingers long after you’ve finished the book.• Dictator Literature: A History of Despots Through Their Writing by Daniel Kalder is published by Oneworld in the UK and is available in the US as The Infernal Library: On Dictators, the Books They Wrote, and Other Catastrophes of Literacy (Henry Holt)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b2cc8b9849475587b64eabac332543c3fdc4f2/164_19_1121_673/master/1121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18cf7879f8460751e6000101d563802f 1240w","title":"somali british poet momtaza mehri named young peoples laureate for london","story":"The 24-year-old poet, with a background in biochemistry, wants young people in the capital ‘to see poetry as part of their every day’The 24-year-old Somali-British poet Momtaza Mehri, who has been chosen as the new young people’s laureate for London, is hoping to spend her year in the role convincing young people “to see poetry as part of their every day, rather than in some dusty tome, or academic niche interest”.Mehri, who has a background in biochemical science and wrote the poetry chapbook sugah. lump. prayer, has been shortlisted for this year’s Brunel African poetry prize and won last year’s Out-Spoken Page poetry prize. As laureate, Mehri hopes to encourage young people to voice their concerns and experiences through poetry.The poet, from Kilburn in north-west London, was selected for the role by a panel of arts organisations and poets, and is, according to Spread the Word’s chair of trustees Rishi Dastidar, “an inspired choice” and a “poet to watch”.“For young people to have an artist who is an ambassador for them, who brings their concerns, struggles and joys to those in authority, and the wider world, is vital,” Dastidar said. “Her poetry is precise and powerful, and rich with images that are haunting. She is not afraid to tackle the biggest of subjects, which, combined with her talent, is going to give the role a renewed sense of purpose and visibility.”Mehri said she was exposed to oral forms of poetry by her family when growing up, but only began writing for publication around four years ago. “Over time I honed, or found, my voice, and that allowed me to feel comfortable, finding the poetic voice I felt was most suited to me. Obviously at the beginning you’re very much inspired by your influences,” she said. “I think the poetry I write is interested in questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces.”During her time in the role, Mehri will be looking to amplify the voices of Londoners aged between 13 and 25, “to let them lead conversations, to be as inspired by them as hopefully they can be inspired by me”. She will work with writer-development agency Spread the Word on youth-focused residencies across London, head a tour to six outer London boroughs, and co-host a special project for young London poets called The Young People’s Poetry Lab.Outgoing young people’s laureate for London, Caleb Femi, said that “poetry has the potential to play a vital part in self-expression and artistic enjoyment in the lives of young people”.“We need a dedicated person who can assist in integrating the joys of poetry into the everydayness of young Londoners,” he added. “We are extremely lucky to have a talented and dedicated poet such as Momtaza Mehri appointed as the new young people’s laureate for London. Her tenure is sure to be an extraordinary one.”Mehri said that she wanted to: “Reach everybody, to allow people to see poetry as part of everyday living in London, and all the different poetry traditions that people bring to London.”“I am very much aware of the fact that I came out of a very different poetic tradition, and what that’s brought to my writing of the English language. So I want to be aware of the fact that people are carrying different poetic influences, whether they consider themselves poets or not,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50df0731d04f515399dca70138e0ed94ba458f78/22_74_1998_1198/master/1998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=888923474efca65b406214ea7dde4638 1240w","title":"jd wetherspoon closes all social media accounts","story":"Platforms ‘waste of time’ says Tim Martin after pub chain’s sites attract online complaints The founder of JD Wetherspoon has said a decision to close all the pub chain’s social media accounts was not a publicity stunt.The company’s move to shut Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for its 900 outlets was greeted with widespread scepticism. Tim Martin, who is also chairman of the company, said it was a business decision because social media had become a “distraction” for the company.“You would have to be completely off your rocker to do a publicity stunt ... which banned the medium which is supposed to give you the most publicity,” he told BBC News.Martin claimed that he was making a stand against social media because it had become a “waste of time” for him and his pubs.“On a personal level many of us are fed up with social media and think it has got damaging effects and a lot of people are on it far far too much,” he said. “It doesn’t do them any good it doesn’t do the country any good.He added: “The people who aren’t on social media wish that their friends weren’t either, because they seem to be obsessed by it. And people who are on it feel they can’t get off it because they are addicted.”Asked if he could rule out rejoining social media platforms in future, Martin said: “If I have to crawl back to Facebook my goodness me that will be a catastrophe. It is not impossible, you have to keep your options open in business. But if I do it – what humiliation.”Martin, who was a significant backer of the Vote Leave campaign, was also asked whether the controversy about the alleged use of Facebook data in the referendum had influenced his decision. He replied: “In politics and business people vastly overestimate social media. I campaigned very vigorously for leave and I did it through writing articles, speaking to the press and the television. I think tweets and Facebook underestimate the intelligence of the public and it’s all a bit of marketing hype really.”In a tweet that is no longer available, Martin said: “We are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business. I don’t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.”Martin is said to have taken the decision following recent publicity over the use of social media to criticise MPs and others, especially those from religious or ethnic minorities. However, the chain has failed to attract much of a following online, with 44,000 followers on Twitter and 100,000 on Facebook. Much of its activity on social media has been devoted to fending off complaints.Martin’s statement said customers could use the Wetherspoon website and app to contact the company, or speak to pub managers.Media commentators predicted that the move would backfire. The chain has also been targeted by pro-Europeans for its support of Brexit, with calls from some to boycott its pubs. The company has often had to deal with hoax statements posted on social media. In November last year, the company was forced to refute a claim that staff had been banned from wearing Remembrance Day poppies while at work.Many of its 900 pubs have Facebook pages with fewer than 1,000 likes, meaning that anything they post is unlikely to be seen by users in their news feed. They are, however, still a magnet for bad reviews, which Facebook displays prominently.One pub, which has an overall star rating of 3.7, still has a review section headed “People talk about terrible service”, and both reviews on display are one-star complaints. The company’s corporate HQ location page on Facebook has also attracted one-star reviews, including one in which a customer claims that her lost glasses were retrieved from a bin.The company has confirmed that no jobs will be affected by the move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1920e1842856ee73f41b12bae46fb86ff8d1332/99_208_3874_2325/master/3874.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=04e6f3c28413413efb0a7365ede5f419 1240w","title":"martin sorrells resignation triggers slide in wpp shares","story":"Market reacts to uncertainty over succession at world’s largest advertising businessSir Martin, who founded WPP 33 years ago, resigned with immediate effect on Saturday amid an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct.Sorrell has “unreservedly denied” the allegations and WPP’s board has said it will not be publishing the outcome of the investigation, carried out by an external law firm.Analysts reacted cautiously to the resignation, telling investors there will not be an immediate crisis at WPP. However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year.“It highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,” Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. “We are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell’s departure on the group’s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.”The next test for WPP comes on 30 April when the company reports its first quarter results. If it fails to meet analyst expectations the share price will take another hit and investor talk of a break-up will likely get louder.It may not seem like it but Sir Martin Sorrell had a career before WPP.

He stepped down on 14 AprilAfter years of stellar performances WPP put out two growth warnings last year – before reporting its worst year since the 2009 ad recession – as clients pulled budgets and investors started to question the future of the global holding company model in the increasingly digital age.“Whether WPP should survive in its current form is a more challenging question,” Davidson said. “Particularly as an increasingly complex and dynamic media landscape, and growing competition from more focused players will, in our view, require a degree of flexibility and agility that large holding companies could struggle to deliver.”A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders, including the Informa chief executive, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and at WPP’s ad agency JWT Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network.The frontrunning internal candidates appear to be Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP’s European operation, who were appointed WPP’s chief operating officers following Sorrell’s departure on Saturday.“We believe Sir Martin will be hard to replace with one person,” Paul Richards, analyst at Numis, said. “The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP. Our base case is for a new management team to continue and refine the existing strategy, though we acknowledge that any group without a chief executive is vulnerable to a bid approach in the interregnum.”Alex DeGroote, analyst at Cenkos Securities, puts the break-up value of WPP’s parts at about £17 a share, valuing the group at £22bn. WPP’s current share price is £11.50, a market capitalisation of £15bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4977df3c64b8f5e4e757e1481cefd2d12196ee/0_0_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=420ce6a15e495d77d7eec72dcea2bda4 2600w","title":"london fields lido did saving a pool mean losing a community","story":"When campaigners successfully reopened the open-air pool in Hackney, they had no idea it would turn their community into something unrecognisableOne summer day in 2003, the local residents of Hackney, north-east London, were invited on a tour of the abandoned site of London Fields Lido. Although closed since 1988, the pool was not empty. Squatters had moved in, and held raves in the old pool tank – much to the annoyance of campaigners, who had cleaned it up for community events. The tour was to introduce locals to a bold new redevelopment plan for the lido: to reopen the pool, install a cafe and evict the squatters.As the locals were shown around, the squatters sat in front of the changing rooms, where purple buddleia had begun to grow above the doors, and watched them. One woman on the tour, meanwhile, enquired whether she would have to swim if she wanted a coffee. It was a moment that seemed to capture the extremes of life in Hackney: young homeless people facing eviction, and an affluent new resident who saw an opportunity for a latte.Campaigners, however, remember the 18 years spent trying to resurrect it. When the pool closed for refurbishment last year, it stayed closed for four months longer than expected, causing locals to anxiously recall the fate of Haggerston Baths a mile away. The grade-II listed building closed in 2000. Despite a 16-year battle, it did not reopen: an unhappy ending for local campaigners.Indeed, you could write an alternative history of Hackney through the story of its pools. As well as London Fields and Haggerston Baths there was the catastrophe of Clissold Leisure Centre, which cost £45m –nearly seven times the original budget – and closed in 2003 for four years following a flood, just 18 months after it had opened. There is also the furore over Britannia Leisure Centre, which despite a £300,000 facelift in 2016 is to be demolished as part of a major redevelopment that will include a leisure centre with three swimming pools, a school and 480 new homes – only 80 of which will be classed as affordable. Victoria Park was once home to the largest modern lido in London. It was demolished in 1990 to make way for a car park.The closure of pools has been disastrous for Hackney schoolchildren. In 2006, a feasibility study on Haggerston Baths found that four out of the five secondary schools surveyed did not provide any form of swimming, due to lack of funding or facilities. At one point in the mid-noughties there was only one swimming pool with lanes to serve a population of more than 200,000.In the last decade and a half, the gap has grown more visible, as Hackney has become one of the hippest destinations in London, with its chic restaurants, boutiques and cafes. On a hot summer weekend, there are so many people in the park that it looks as if there’s a festival underway. And at the heart of it all is London Fields Lido.Caroline, who serves freshly baked croissants and toasties at a kiosk in the lido, has lived in the neighbourhood for 33 years and has seen the new arrivals flood in. Her flat overlooks the park and she complains about the impact of the crowds – the shortage of toilets and the noise. She regrets the loss of community spirit, and feels that, with rare exceptions, the incomers don’t know how to be good neighbours. ‘I think they’re afraid, they don’t want to mix,” she says. “People walk past you as though you’ve got green wires coming out of your head.”The original Lido is an island beach resort in Venice. It became the popular name for open air pools in the 1930s, bringing continental holiday glamour to gloomy British summers during a boom for building outdoor pools. It was with this ambition that London Fields Lido opened in 1932.As Janet Smith reveals in her very enjoyable history Liquid Assets, the fashion for lido-building was driven by an egalitarian ethos. When Morecambe’s open air pool opened in 1936, Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, declared: “Bathing reduces rich and poor, high and low, to a common standard of enjoyment and health. When we get down to swimming, we get down to democracy.” London County Council (LCC) was particularly zealous in its lido-building programme. Herbert Morrison, leader of the LCC in the late 30s, wanted London to be a “city of lidos”, with every citizen within walking distance of an open air pool.Margaret Thatcher signalled the end for public swimming with her war on local government spending. London Fields Lido was just one of the many casualties in the 1980s as councils cut their budgets.Mike Martin remembers standing in front of the bulldozer at 7am. He was part of a campaign to save London Fields Lido, which had halted the council’s plans to demolish the pool – but he and his fellow campaigners were then tipped off that the demolition team had somehow not got the message and had turned up to do the job anyway. The lido was saved in the nick of time.In their determination to resurrect London Fields Lido, campaigners including Martin joined forces with architects and the Environment Trust, and presented plans for the pool to the community in 2003. Hackney council finally agreed to fund the renovation in 2004.The transformation that has taken place in the neighbourhood since was initially driven by campaigners seeking to regenerate the borough – not only at the lido, but also a few minutes away on Broadway Market, a street below London Fields that was once a drovers’ route into the city. It hosts a hugely successful Saturday market launched by local residents and traders in 2004, two years before the pool reopened. Time Out calls the street “a promenade for the East End fashion set”.Many people are boosters of the newly revitalised area. “What does it say about the last 30-odd years of government in this country that people from other parts of the country are travelling down to London to spend the weekend in a park?” asks Hackney councillor Jon Burke, who is responsible for energy, sustainability and community services, including lidos. “Where have we gone so badly wrong that Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Hull, don’t offer this standard of living to everybody?”For some of the campaigners who kickstarted the regeneration, however, there is a rueful recognition of the role they may have played in changing the character of the neighbourhood. Liz Veitch, a retired teacher, says that when she first moved to London Fields 25 years ago, she could almost see the tumbleweed blowing down Broadway Market, a street that had once been home to a popular East End market. Hackney council made a number of failed attempts to revive it, but it was only when local residents took on the challenge that the market succeeded. Her late husband, journalist Andrew Veitch, played an instrumental role in the market’s success, setting up a community interest company that he ran for 10 years. The revival of the market was a catalyst that helped transform London Fields into a destination for hipsters, swiftly followed by the reopening of the lido.“In the beginning it was local people trying to make what was a beaten up area a bit more attractive,” says Veitch. “People who moved in here, like us, felt they ought to do more in the community. I would say that the people buying into this area do not seem to share the same sense of community. The youngsters buying or renting these flats are too busy trying to live, but also there is an air of entitlement amongst amongst some of the more affluent members of the next generation. Thatcher’s children if you like. They don’t get involved here. When we were growing up, it was a mantra that was part of our upbringing - if you’re in a community you join in and do what you can.”When Hackney Council began selling off properties in Broadway Market at the start of the millennium, resulting in the eviction of popular local independent businesses, there was a huge campaign to stop the demolition of Cafe Francesca, run by Tony Platia for 30 years. Gentrification became a very dirty word, as Hackney council was accused of betraying the neighbourhood and getting into bed with the property developers.“The lido does not reflect the demography of Hackney,” says Josephine Bacon, who runs the lido user group. “It’s very white, it’s very middle class, it’s quite young. Hackney and Better’s advertisements promote swimming for everyone, saying come and join in, and they have photographs of black people on their posters and banners. Of course there are some black people there, but hardly any. And probably not very many unemployed or low income swimmers either. And I’m not really sure why - whether because it’s too expensive or because London Fields has become a chi-chi area. I don’t know what can be done to make it more inclusive.”It’s a problem that goes beyond Hackney. Swim England’s research in 2015 revealed that ethnic minorities are half as likely to know how to swim as white members of the population. The closure of Hackney’s pools in the noughties may also have had an impact on the next generation of swimmers. It may, however, be true that the number of options is increasing: London Fields Lido is dwarfed by the London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, a legacy of the 2012 Olympics that is home to three pools. The once run-down neighbourhood of Hackney Wick, on the edge of what was the Olympic Park, is now touted as the next London Fields – but that has also meant the demolition of Vittoria Wharf, forcing out a community of poorer residents and artists.London Fields Lido “is not a country club for the affluent,” Burke insists. “It’s important that this facility is able to be accessed by people irrespective of their socioeconomic, ethnic, religious backgrounds.” He says he hopes that the new refurbishment of the changing rooms – which includes the introduction of internal cubicles and internal lockers – will broaden its appeal, as well as satisfying those who have previously been concerned about modesty or security.So far, it’s hard to tell. The newly-refurbished lido reopened in January many of the swimmers are young and white, more typical of newcomers to the neighbourhood than longtime residents. This may not be the classless vision of lido culture that its great political advocates imagined in the 30s when they built the pools in London and across the UK. It may not be the community that the campaigners imagined either, when they fought to revive the lido and what was then a run-down market street. But it’s now a fixture and a landmark – even if that’s as a symbol of ision as much as transformation.A version of this article appears in Tales of Two Londons, edited by Claire Armitstead Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a5a9c74416903a3838ff3136545575f6eb02945/0_268_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c62eae39d9fb6e59fe2c6e497cd5d568 1240w","title":"britain wrongly deporting commonwealth nationals summit windrush","story":"Richard Stewart is one of my constituents in Edmonton, where I am the member of parliament. He came to the UK from Jamaica in 1955, aged 10, and has lived here and paid taxes for over six decades. He even played for Middlesex county cricket club. However, in 2013 he was told by the Home Office that he had lost his British nationality when Jamaica declared independence in 1962. He has faced uncertainty over his legal status ever since.Trevor Lloyd Johnson is another constituent. He arrived from Jamaica in 1971, almost four decades ago, aged 10. Trevor was threatened with the possibility of deportation, and his family has spent the last few months in a nightmare of Home Office bureaucracy, tracking down historical documents that he was never asked to hold on to in the first place. He had to do so to prove his right not to be deported.Or take the cases, already documented, of my constituents Elwaldo Romeo, who came from Antigua 59 years ago, aged four, and Anthony Bryan, who was almost sent back to Jamaica after 52 years in the UK.As of today, I am helping with 14 similar cases in my constituency. They include people originally from Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Barbados and Antigua and Barbuda – all Commonwealth countries. One even served in the British army. And these cases are all from Edmonton – they are probably the tip of an iceberg.Countless people came to the UK from Commonwealth countries before 1973. They have a legal right to remain in the country. They worked hard. They paid taxes. They raised families. They made the UK the country it is today.But little by little, through the Immigration Act 1971, the British Nationality Act 1981 and the Immigration Act 1988, the rights of Commonwealth citizens were aligned with those of other immigrants. Their special status was eroded.In recent months, the Home Office seems to have stepped up its targeting of Commonwealth citizens. The immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, has now admitted that the government has wrongly deported an unspecified number of the Windrush generation. Many others have been threatened with deportation unless they can produce nearly impossible sets of historical documents, covering every period of their lives in the UK over many decades. This leaves Theresa May with urgent questions to answer. This week of all weeks, she should be showing the Commonwealth that the UK puts people before free trade deals.Rather than the Home Office itself keeping full records, the burden of proof of right to remain is shifted on to people, many of them vulnerable. This is extremely cruel and traumatising, since those affected run the risk of being separated from their families, or even being sent to countries they barely remember from childhood. Yesterday, in a new case, I was contacted by a man who arrived legally in 1970 from Jamaica, aged 11. Having lost his British passport and finding himself unable to meet new Home Office requirements to produce documents, he is now homeless, unemployed and distraught.Back in June 2016, as the country voted in the EU referendum, certain politicians promised that life would get easier, not harder, for Commonwealth citizens wanting to come to the UK. Priti Patel even promised south Asian chefs could come to the UK and save the British curry house. Such promises are now revealed to have been shameful lies.This week, however, May has a chance to change tack when she hosts leaders of 53 Commonwealth countries in London for the Commonwealth summit. Here is her opportunity to prove wrong those who say that the government, far from engaging with other countries in a spirit of equality, respect, and solidarity, is instead treating the Commonwealth as Empire 2.0.Last week, I suggested that the role of the next head of the Commonwealth, rather than automatically going to Prince Charles, should be the person who best represents the important and progressive values that the association has pledged to uphold. I should have been more explicit that that decision is, of course, one for Commonwealth countries to make together – and not one for UK politicians.But this point aside, May must now guarantee the status of Commonwealth nationals whose right to remain is supposed to be protected by law – by upholding the legal protections that previously existed, by ending the deportations, and by establishing an amnesty for anyone who arrived as a minor before 1973. She can stop the uncertainty that hangs over Richard, Trevor, Elwaldo, Anthony and many others – as tens of thousands of people have asked her to in just a few days, by signing a petition. .Where some verification is needed, she must make sure that the Home Office has a practical, humane process and that the burden of proof is reasonable.As my colleague Diane Abbott has said, the prime minister must now also urgently apologise, say how many Commonwealth citizens have been wrongly deported, and take immediate action to invite them back to the UK.• Kate Osamor is MP for Edmonton and shadow secretary of state for international development"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868df3251f60c7f0fe71cd49a179e83ddfeb27ff/112_592_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c5b3c438ae0dbe93ded39a57ac89b36 1240w","title":"landlords social parasites last people should be honouring buy to let","story":"The landlord of the year award is announced on Monday, bestowed by the home insurance provider Home Protect. “Landlords often get a bad rap,” the CEO explains on its website, and I’ll stop him there. They don’t get a bad enough rap.When they do make the news, you already know the story. Tory landlords dragging their absentee, ancient arses into parliament solely to vote down a bill that says rented properties should be “fit for human habitation”. “Lockdown” landlords bleeding councils dry, installing vulnerable people in micro-units, with inadequate fire provisions, so they can soak up treble the housing benefit. Who can forget the competition in the Daily Mail that offered up a buy-to-let property as top prize? This, from a paper that crucifies scroungers. Scroungers being people who live off others, and shirk their responsibilities. But back to landlords, eh?Landlord of the year. Lol! Rofbhawuild! (Rolling on the floor, banging my head against the wall until I lose my deposit.) Who is it going to be? One who lets you have a pet? Some of my friends are landlords, and I’m sorry to say it, but they are going straight to hell too. Imagine how satisfyingly overcrowded the underworld must be with landlords partitioning the seventh circle into seven more circles, charging each other extra for underfloor heating. The best thing you can say about them is that they are better than letting agents. But that’s like giving Stalin a humanitarian award for massacring fewer people than Genghis Khan. The fact is, they’re all rogue. Whether your landlord is a genial profiteer or an actual psychopath is the luck of the draw. Anyone can be one, if they have made enough money or inherited property, and those are two of the worst qualifications imaginable. Like anyone who thrives off the housing crisis, they are social parasites.I wonder what is meant by a “good” private landlord, worthy of recognition. Someone who charges below insane market rates, purely by choice? Who pays for top-quality repairs, when they could get a mate to do a botched job on the cheap? Who offers long-term secure tenancies, despite the fact there is no legal minimum? Who refrains from revenge evictions? Who isn’t Fergus Wilson? Someone who displays basic human decency, in an unregulated sector that encourages its opposite? Who acts, in other words, not like a landlord at all?If you are an oldster with a lodger, I’m sure you’re fine. But it’s the buy-to-let vampires, monopolising new builds, setting social inequality in stone, who define the term today. Try to understand these characters, so money-driven that they view people’s need to sleep indoors as the chance to turn a tidy profit. (Having said that, the main cause of homelessness in the UK is, by a long way, the termination of short-term tenancies, so maybe they’re not that committed to it.) No pets, no posters, no parties. That’s their mantra. No repairs. Don’t wear down the crap carpet. Just sit on a damp mattress and cough up the cash. All so they can keep expanding, squatting over lives like feudal incubi. If you’re one of these people, you can shove your property portfolio up your arse. And make sure you leave room for your award.The notion of houses as investment opportunities of any sort has been a cancer. Here’s a radical idea: buy a home if you can, then live in it, and do something else with your time. Something that isn’t about exploiting the less privileged. Apologies for taking a Daily Mail-sounding stance on this, but landlords: get a proper job.A University of Kansas professor studying friendship has concluded that it takes more than 50 hours of shared time to become anything more than an acquaintance, 90\u0026nbsphours\u0026nbspto develop a friendship, and more than 200 hours of time together to become close friends. As\u0026nbspan introvert who lives in a city, I\u0026nbspsee the people I\u0026nbspreally like about twice a year maximum, so we should\u0026nbspmake the grade by the time\u0026nbspwe’re 100 years old.Time and activities in a developing friendship “can be thought of as strategic investments toward satiating long-term belongingness needs,” says the study’s author, Jeffrey Hall, which makes me sure that, if we were friends, I’d call him “Prof” and we’d get into mismatched scrapes together, adorably. The types of experience matter, too – hours spent working together don’t count for as much, he has decided. I’m not so sure some of the best relationships of my life have revolved around bitching about bosses, creative slacking and covering for each other. But then, I never actually\u0026nbspdid any work at work.It strikes me that the character of\u0026nbspreal life relationships – often boring, sometimes resentful, even harrowing – has no online analogue. I never felt closer to any people than\u0026nbspthose with whom I was once stuck in a remote French cottage. The septic tank became clogged, and\u0026nbspthe toilet wouldn’t flush. A few days, during which you cannot poo,\u0026nbspfeels like an eternity. It was astonishing how colonic our conversations grew, and how quickly. A practical girl called Kate eventually climbed into the tank to plunge it.

Like a house of black mirrors from a Freudian funfair, it looks like a listicle of romcoms featuring a hapless white lady, with a kind heart and an unfortunate failing, struggling to get it together with the square-jawed-but-equally-flawed male lead. Honestly, it could be a cut-and-paste job from the Wikipedia filmography of Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lopez or various actors named Ryan.You like romcoms? Good for you, no judgment. But I find this feed of saccharine narratives insidious, especially when these films codify gender roles and relationship goals in an infantilising manner. Sure, occasionally I watch them (to be honest, not actually that often, but whatever), however it is definitely not all I want to see. Watching only my Netflix recommendations would be like using the internet only to look at cat pictures: reasonable on one level, but you would undeniably also miss out on some interesting stuff.Netflix’s biggest competitor, according to its CEO, is not other streaming services, but sleep. This observation is both sinister and unintentionally revealing about the quality of its content. But I also get it: by the time I am scrolling around looking for something to watch, I am usually seeking what gambling researchers call “the zone” – a state of wellbeing characterised by a sense of relief and an absence of stress.I just want to tune out, and Netflix has a financial interest in perpetuating that state, uninterrupted, for as long as possible. Escapism is an important component of emotional wellbeing, and thankfully a Netflix binge is less harmful than a gambling addiction. But I would not want Netflix’s bottom line to be a determinant for cultural production and consumption.Consuming culture should be about delight and surprise it should be comforting and unsettling it should be thought-provoking and create space for self-reflection. It need not be all of these things at once, but a balanced diet helps us understand each other across social ides and make sense of the human experience. Just as we should resist outsourcing our ethical decisions to machines, we should not allow them to make cultural ones for us either.Encouraging us to make choices about cultural consumption based on path dependency, as the Netflix algorithm does, is not a neutral phenomenon. Maciej Cegłowski has written about how by clicking on recommended links in YouTube, you can end up watching videos about conspiracy theories surprisingly quickly. Using machine learning to keep people hooked on a platform can animate our desire to either escape our emotions, or fuel them – these are two sides of the same coin.Outrage, like escapism, can be healthy and appropriate, but coding our online life in ways that are slavish to these emotional states in subtle ways is hardly ideal. It might make platforms a lot of money, but it also degrades our sense of what is possible, and the commonality of human experiences. “By emphasising the inidual to an extreme,” Joseph Turow writes in his book Niche Envy, “the new niche-making forces are encouraging values that diminish the sense of belonging that is necessary to a healthy civic life.”Machines make mistakes and engender specific values in ways that are hard to detect when we rely on them to make decisions or recommendations. Now more than ever we must embrace the process of defining our values publicly and collectively, to invite scrutiny into machine learning, to find ways to keep these algorithms accountable and make them more transparent. Until then, I’m steering clear of anything featuring a Ryan or a Jennifer, no matter what Netflix recommends.• Lizzie O’Shea is an Australian human rights lawyer, broadcaster and writer living in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7e069bf900f3deb66b36477527333d4dcdd8adb/0_85_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e36d1cc74454f9a0b408be54f0e773f6 1240w","title":"syria bombs western policy diplomacy africa china","story":"The past week has seemed like a bad rerun. For the third time in 15 years, western countries, led by the United States, have taken military action against a majority Muslim, Middle Eastern country. Support for intervention is not limited to the hard right: that Syria should be bombed was the mainstream view of the American foreign policy establishment, along with Britain and France.Let us be clear that the use of chemical weapons is a horrific crime. But we do not know the full story of what happened in Douma to say this is not to engage in conspiracy theories, but merely to admit that it has still been only a few days since the reports emerged. Yet there seems to be little interest among pro-interventionists in asking even basic questions, or in allowing the UN to lead an investigation. We have been here before with the lies that led to the Iraq war, but that precedent does not seem to deter western leaders as they seek yet again to rush to claim the moral high ground.But if it is astounding that after failure in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, the west has chosen military intervention again, what is just as disappointing is that the rest of the world continues to turn a blind eye. It is time for non-western countries to recognise that by not getting proactively involved in international diplomatic efforts on these big issues, they relegate themselves to second-tier players, and allow western leaders to define what “appropriate” and “responsible” actions are.There has been some progress. Long criticised for not living up to its global responsibilities as a major power, in recent years China has expanded its foreign presence and soft power, with the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Belt and Road Initiative and a greater presence in global peacekeeping forces. Or look at south-east Asia, a region that has seen decades of interstate peace while being at least as ethnically and religiously erse as the war-torn Middle East.But while governments as well as iniduals across Africa and Asia are frustrated and angered by self-serving western actions, most remain silent. And without alternative initiatives and engagement from non-western actors, the west ends up monopolising the discussion. It is time politicians and diplomats in other parts of the world seized the initiative and stopped accepting their second-class status in the affairs of the world.Western nations may resist the erosion of their influence. Remember how the west dismissed the brokering initiative of the African Union in Libya and instead resorted to military intervention? It is a firmly held, yet rarely spoken, view in western political and diplomatic circles, that the rest of the world is unqualified to play any role in such crises – even though when it comes to understanding the root causes of many geopolitical tensions, diplomats from countries that have been colonised or otherwise interfered with by foreign powers are surely better equipped than the former colonial powers to find solutions.A high-level UN delegation, not led by western diplomats but instead by others from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, working for the last few years with the Syrian government, might well have found some solutions, had President Assad been offered some form of guarantee that he would not meet the same fate as Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi.After this latest strike by the west, the rest of the world needs to say “enough is enough”. Large, non-western countries or blocks such as India, Japan, China, Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and others such as the African Union, need to not just speak out against strikes, as China already has, but also work together to propose – and perhaps even implement – a different, non-violent and diplomatic platform. Allowing the west to dictate terms is last century’s norm.• Chandran Nair is chief executive and founder of the Global Institute For Tomorrow, a Hong Kong based thinktank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1fe237e87cd6d35e321869c571294215f6054c/84_245_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8bd9e20e4a5af27771ced1b8a6d549db 1240w","title":"theresa may children windrush ministers","story":"One of the most appalling elements of the Windrush generation immigration scandal is that the mess is so easily fixable. The government has long had the right and the facility to grant indefinite leave to remain to those whose presence in the country may be technically questionable but socially desirable. That it has chosen not to do so tells us much, as does today’s revelation that No 10 has snubbed a plea from Commonwealth heads of government for talks about the debacle.The government has not acted decisively so far because it has not felt compelled to do so. For many months now, the Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman has trodden a lonely path in trying to highlight these stories, without exciting the sort of supplementary interest from other media that might persuade ministers and their advisers that failure to do so placed their own futures in jeopardy. But in recent days, other newspapers and broadcasters have begun to expose the government’s failure to act. The equation, and with it the level of risk to politicians and bureaucrats, has changed. That speaks to the power of the media even now to hold the system to account, a vital component of our democracy. But it also says some sorry things about Theresa May and those who do her bidding.This is a government that lacks purpose and obvious competence. We see that in its stewardship of the NHS, the benefits system, and most of all, its muddling towards an ill-considered, undefined, illogical Brexit. But what is just as disturbing, given the might of government and the extent to which its activities have a direct effect on people’s lives, is the lack of any moral grounding or emotional intelligence. It wields power disproportionately and clumsily. It tramples on the cares of ordinary people like a drunk in hobnail boots.It is said that up close, May herself is thoughtful and personable, but when it’s time to go to work, she is the leader who thought the best way to allay immigration concerns was to hire vans with advertising boards telling undesired immigrants to “go home”. She is the one who sent the signal to her officials that, henceforth, those whose immigration status was questionable should find Britain a “hostile environment”. She is the one who went to Grenfell and, initially at least, couldn’t spare the time to speak to victims. She runs a government that tells the infirm that they must work and disabled people that they aren’t really disabled.Leaders lead. Followers follow. If you look at May’s bloodless, technocratic approach to government, you easily understand how those who serve her feel able, or perhaps compelled, to do their jobs unburdened by any demand for compassion or empathy. She sets the tone. She must change it. She could start today by meeting the Caribbean leaders and responding to their concerns, as well as those voiced by 140 MPs from across the political spectrum.Of course, that will require political navigation. She knows that after the poisonous Brexit campaign – and thanks to her lieutenants, messrs Gove and Johnson – the public expectation is that by fair means or foul, she will be tough towards immigrants. But even her own logic dictates a different approach. Along with the “deep and special” relationship she envisages with the EU post-Brexit, her ministers promise a new and vital recoupling with the Commonwealth. How does this mistreatment of its people, this trashing of historic ties and this deaf ear to the concerns of its representatives, forward that strategy?It could be that, in their calculations, ministers believed that there would be no groundswell of support for middle-aged black people, irrespective of any ties they have or the contributions they have made to communities up and down the country. In that, again, the technocrats are being proved wrong by the media, MPs and the public. That may be the only heartening development so far in this sorry affair.• Hugh Muir is associate editor of Guardian Opinion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/207ad3dbdd62fc5a379f11694f50ff015aec128d/0_340_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=136e1f162576299b3835c385915ec99a 2600w","title":"eyes throat burning what caused birling gap toxic cloud","story":"Last August, holidaymakers in East Sussex fell ill after a poisonous yellow cloud spread across the sky. What was it, and where did it come from?Mark Sawyer has worked for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution for nearly 30 years, and since 2001 he’s been the full-time coxswain at the Eastbourne lifeboat station. Shortly after 5pm on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend last August, he received a report from the coastguard in Southampton about an incident at a beach seven miles west of his station. “The call we got was that there had either been a fire or an explosion at Birling Gap, and they’d got 50-plus casualties suffering from smoke inhalation or burns.” There was what looked like a layer of thick smoke hanging just above the sea.Birling Gap is a popular National Trust spot between Beachy Head and Seaford, a dip in the chalk cliffs of the Seven Sisters, with a steel staircase leading down to a pebble beach. At low tide there is sand and rockpools on the cliffs above there is a visitor centre, cafe, car park and coastguard station.By 6pm that Sunday, the beach had been evacuated and a major incident declared, and Eastbourne district general hospital was carrying out one of the biggest mass decontaminations in NHS history.The gas or vapour appeared to come rolling along the shore from the east. “We could see this yellowy haze in the air,” a member of the Eastbourne coastguard team says. “It was almost like the film The Fog.” (The fog of John Carpenter’s 1980 horror brings with it the malevolent ghosts of drowned sailors.) Others describe it as clear, or blueish, or sandy. In the frenetic smartphone footage from the scene it looks like a vapour, with a yellow tint, though this might be an effect of the low, late-afternoon sun. It was reported variously as having an odour of chlorine, ammonia and burning plastic. Others say it had no odour, but more of a taste, a chemical astringency in the throat. “We’ve got the water-treatment works near the harbour,” Sawyer says, “but that’s a different smell, I can assure you. The fishermen used to say if the wind’s in the right direction, you can smell your way back to Eastbourne.” A taxi driver who had been nearby at the time says with disarming certainty that it smelled of “potash and corpses”.Meanwhile, Sawyer and his RNLI colleagues were approaching Birling Gap from the east, in their lifeboat Diamond Jubilee. It had been an exceptionally busy 24 hours for the station, even by the standards of a hot bank holiday weekend. Just after midnight a car had been driven over Beachy Head, close to Birling Gap, and the RNLI had spent the morning at the scene. Around 11am, having been up much of the night, the crew was called to recover a body that had been spotted by a fishing boat. That afternoon they also undertook one of the RNLI’s lesser-known roles, the scattering of ashes at sea. They were flagging when the call came in about Birling Gap.“As we were leaving, the coastguard told us they were getting unconfirmed reports that people were suffering from the effects of a poisonous gas,” Sawyer says, as we sit in his office overlooking Eastbourne’s Sovereign Harbour. “As we went towards the west we could see this haze, and all of a sudden our eyes started to burn and you could feel the back of your throat burning. We were told in no uncertain terms, ‘Get into the wheelhouse and shut the doors.’”It took a while for Laura Knight, a drama therapist from Brighton, to realise anything was wrong. She had been on the beach since about 2pm, with her partner and two children, aged six and nine. They were planning a barbecue. “The height of the tide at that time meant the beach was quite thin, and everybody was crammed on the shingle. We had a little swim, everyone was enjoying the sun, and then we started noticing that people were coughing and their eyes were streaming.” It resembled a dense, morning sea mist, she says. “It started slowly to come in, then you lost sight of the cliffs.”Later that afternoon, Eastbourne’s Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, was at Cork airport in Ireland, waiting for a flight home after a weekend break, when texts started coming in about the haze. “So I make some calls and I learn a ‘poisonous gas cloud’ has materialised at Birling Gap,” he says. “I thought, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ With all the fear around terrorism, you just don’t know. I spoke to someone at the hospital and they said, ‘People are coming in we don’t know what it is.’ They were scrabbling around in the dark.”Sussex police, who coordinated the response on land, received the first call about the event at 5.08pm. It came not from a member of the public but from an officer who had been given the information by the RNLI. As the makeup of the cloud was unknown, and reports of symptoms were coming in from a wide area, a forward control point was set up just over a mile from Birling Gap, at the Beachy Head car park. Police, firefighters, ambulance crews and the coastguard convened. Within an hour the police had released a statement advising residents in the area to stay inside, with doors and windows closed. By 5.30pm, the coastguard and RNLI had started evacuating three miles of coastline between Birling Gap and Eastbourne.“By this time a lot of people had left the beach,” Knight remembers. “Then we saw the fire brigade arrive with full protective gear on – head to toe in masks, goggles – and everyone else was semi-naked. I started to really cough, I could feel it in my chest. My eyes were burning. Then of course the anxiety gets you. The children started seeing police officers and my son was really concerned about the animals, the sheep. He was saying, ‘What’s going to happen to all the farm animals, Mummy, is someone going to move them?’ Had it hit a busy beach like Brighton, it would have been a major, major incident.”At 6pm patients started arriving at Eastbourne hospital, not only from Birling Gap but also from the wider Eastbourne area. They were complaining of streaming eyes, coughing and sore throats there had also been reports of vomiting. “We work on a 1-2-3 rule,” says chief operating officer Joe Chadwick-Bell. “If the first patient comes along: interesting. If somebody else comes along, you think something’s going on. If a third person comes along, it’s not a coincidence.” As more patients started to arrive, the A\u0026ampE department declared a major incident.A report published in January by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that the fire service deployed mobile gas detectors calibrated to locate carbon monoxide, oxygen, flammable gas and hydrogen sulphide – chemicals they might expect to encounter in the course of their more regular callouts. Only a very low reading was recorded for flammable gas and a single reading for ammonia at a level too low to be registered by humans. Furthermore, a police tactical adviser specialising in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats was called in to test the air, but again found nothing of concern. No samples were taken by any agency.As dusk fell, a queue had formed at the hospital, as patients were assessed by medics in fluorescent green hazmat suits and processed through a decontamination tent set up outside A\u0026ampE. At one point more than 80 people were queueing. Patients arrived throughout the night and into the next morning. On the advice of the National Poisons Information Service, 108 were showered, their clothes placed in a plastic bag, and issued with a hospital gown and slippers before proceeding to A\u0026ampE. Consultant Dr Zeki Atesli was on call that day. “The most common complaint was red eyes,” he says. “The poisons unit mentioned ammonia, but I didn’t smell any gas. We didn’t know what we were dealing with. One patient with acute exacerbation of asthma we took into resus as a precaution another gentleman in his 70s with a history of angina developed chest pain. One girl collapsed in my arms from the anxiety. But no one was pushing or screaming. English people are very nice. They stay in the queue.”“You could taste it,” Chadwick-Bell says. “It was an acidy-type taste.” Hearing that the cloud was moving west, she contacted Eastbourne’s sister hospital at St Leonards-on-Sea in Hastings, 14 miles along the coast, which was put on alert for a major incident. “They had their tent out and they were ready to go.” Although only a few patients turned up in Hastings, the cloud had spread far beyond Birling Gap. Just over half a mile inland, people drinking in the garden of the Tiger Inn in East Dean were advised by police to evacuate, while sore throats and stinging eyes were experienced at a beer festival in Litlington, three miles north-west of Birling Gap. Tony Fitch, who has been fishing in the area for 65 years, spent the day on the beach at Pevensey Bay, nine miles east. He remembers a mist and a sea breeze from the south-east, and while he noticed nothing amiss at the time, the next morning he had a sore throat and sore eyes, symptoms he says have lingered to this day.Eastbourne’s new town slogan, launched in the summer of 2016, caused a stir: “Breathe It In” is a brave choice for a town recently ranked as one of Britain’s worst for air quality. Dr Gary Fuller of King’s College London, an expert in air pollution, works with the Sussex Air Quality Partnership, an organisation promoting better air quality in the county. He explains that two fixed monitors registered unusually high spikes of ozone late in the afternoon on 27 August, at around the time of the haze. “The peaks were exceptional,” he says. “This wasn’t just something confined to the beach at Birling Gap it was covering a far wider area.” A monitor at Lullington Heath, five miles inland, and another in Eastbourne both recorded a rapid rise in the gas on the same afternoon. The abruptness of the peaks was unusual, however, and it’s possible the monitors were responding to another substance: chlorine, for instance, can affect ozone readings. “It didn’t behave as we would expect ozone to behave,” Fuller says.While no one appeared to have been made seriously ill, dozens of Stephen Lloyd’s constituents, who hours earlier had been sunbathing, found themselves standing naked in a decontamination shower. No one knows how many more experienced symptoms, but tens of thousands were advised to close their doors and windows and stay inside. Lloyd began pressing the agencies for information.“At the back of my mind I was thinking: suppose if someone had dropped dead. Surely someone’s going to tell me what it is. Where the hell did it come from? Everyone’s telling me it’s probably a boat cleaning its tanks. But not to worry, they said, the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency are checking it out.”According to a freedom of information request, Public Health England’s working hypothesis, revealed in an email sent to the Cabinet Office at 1am that night, was that “a tanker in the English Channel suffered a leakage of ammonia”, even though only small amounts had been detected at Birling Gap. As well as monitoring fuel emissions, the International Maritime Organization regulates the discharge of effluent and bilge water, chemical-cargo vapours, tank-cleaning chemicals and ballast-water disinfectants. Any of these, released deliberately or by accident, may have been to blame. Sawyer found two reports of a chemical tanker washing out its tanks on the edge of the fishing lanes that day, but the vessel was not identified. The coastguard received a report of a vessel discharging “odd-coloured exhaust” but it, too, has been ruled out as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.At the Sovereign Harbour lifeboat station, a live GPS screen shows all the vessels in the Channel. Looking out through the window, I can make out only two or three hazy ghosts of ships on the horizon, but the screen shows dozens – private yachts, trawlers, 30,000-tonne tankers, 150,000-tonne container ships – with their rate of knots and direction, and ports of origin and destination. Little can pass through the Channel unmonitored.Using techniques developed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986, the Met Office was able to trace the course of the plume in the hours before it reached Birling Gap. According to Defra, “The surface air had come over the sea from an easterly direction for the previous nine hours but before that the wind had been… from the west. This strongly suggests an offshore source in the northern part of the English Channel, and effectively rules out France or onshore sources in southern England.” But the timescale, the size of the area from which the substance could have come and the fact that it hadn’t been identified meant the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency was unable to narrow down the number of suspect vessels to fewer than 180, many of which were hundreds of miles away by the time the analysis was done.In Fuller’s experience, the event is unprecedented in Britain. The only incident that comes close occurred in 1997, when a tanker collision off Ostend, Belgium, sent a cloud of petrol vapour across central England, causing irritation to skin and eyes. But both the substance and its source were quickly identified. “We tend to focus on air pollution in towns,” he adds. “We forget there are big sources out there, just a few miles off the coast.”Professor John Sodeau, an expert in air pollution and atmospheric chemistry at University College Cork, believes the weather conditions on the day are crucial to understanding what happened. He suggests that sulphurous emissions from ships’ engines reacted with chlorine-containing substances used in the cleaning of ballast or cargo tanks, and the resulting gases and vapours accumulated in the sunny, windless conditions. As he puts it, “Throw the ingredients into a saucepan, bring to the boil, put on a lid and leave to simmer.” Such a “soup” could not only cause symptoms of the kind reported when blown ashore, but could result in the creation of compounds that might smell like burning plastic or chlorine, as well as raising ozone levels.But shipping waste was not the only theory. Two days after the event, the Twitter account of the NERC Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (Neodaas) posted an image recorded by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite at 10.56 on the morning of the cloud. It shows Birling Gap on the coast, and on the water, about five miles to the south-west, a slender plume of what looks like smoke. It is about two miles long and extends in a roughly easterly direction. No ship is visible. The following day, another Twitter user replied: “That is the position of the wreck of ww1 tanker Mira.”The SS Mira, a merchant oil tanker sunk by a mine in October 1917, lies 20 metres underwater at almost precisely the point from which the plume appears to originate. Could this have been the source? Ben Taylor of Neodaas, who posted the images, says the plume is not visible in satellite passes from the previous month, and first appears seven hours before people began to experience symptoms at Birling Gap. It was soon observed that the plume was heading in the wrong direction to have hit Birling Gap – east, rather than west with the wind. Taylor now believes it was not gas or vapour but underwater silt, disturbed by the shifting of the 100-year-old wreck and carried on currents. But as he says, “The timing is certainly strange.”For his part, Tony Fitch, who was fishing at Pevensey Bay that day, is convinced the cloud came from a French nuclear power station, more than 60 miles across the Channel. He has asked his GP to test him for the effects of radiation. It would not be the first time a substance carried on the air from France affected the region: people in Eastbourne and across southern England remember “Le Pong” of 2013, when an escape of methanethiol, a chemical used to add a warning odour to domestic gas, floated over from a chemical works in Rouen, 100 miles away.The ersity of public theories about the origin of the substance – chlorine gas leaking from a first world war wreck an accident at an incinerator some creation of a nearby offshore windfarm a top-secret military psyop – is inevitable, given that the substance remains officially unidentified eight months later. It was for this reason, too, that the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency aborted its investigation in late September.“They told me all the way through,” says Stephen Lloyd MP, “‘Don’t worry, we’ve identified the ships that were in the area, but we have to wait till they port before we check it out.’ But then six weeks later I hear: ‘No, we’re not doing it, there’s no point, because we don’t know what it is.’ It is criminally wrong that this country and our emergency services don’t have the kit that can store, assess and measure what the hell this was.”Lloyd is not alone in pressing for more information. Green party MEP Keith Taylor has asked Defra whether the incident was reported to the European Commission. The Seveso directive states a report must be made by an EU member country if more than 500 people are “evacuated or confined” for over two hours as a result of an accident involving a dangerous substance. He believes the event meets these criteria, but the commission can find no record of such a report being made, and Defra has not responded to requests for clarification. “It is hard to escape the feeling that the government has consistently shrugged its shoulders in response to this incident,” Taylor says.He also highlights a second incident, four miles along the coast exactly two months later. On the night of 27 October, a stench of burning plastic was reported by residents of Seaford, along with burning eyes and nausea. Although the council attributed the odour to nearby agricultural activity, residents wondered if there was a connection to the more serious event that summer.Defra’s scientific report into the incident, released in January, concludes that, while a ship remains the most likely culprit, “unless further information is obtained, it may never be possible to identify the precise source of the release”.“If one old person or one baby had died because of this gas,” Lloyd says, “and no one knew what it was, my God, there would have been resignations of chief executives and secretaries of state.”In December, Defra announced a review of the emergency response which, among other issues, will investigate “the practicalities of taking, storing and analysing gas samples in future events of this kind”. But the experts have their doubts. “You do not just collect the air in a bell jar and take it home for later analysis,” says air pollution specialist John Sodeau. “Samples have to be collected on site and analysed in real time. The levels may be parts per trillion or billion and the chemical radicals involved may last for only seconds.”Defra’s review is ongoing. It has no plans to make its findings public. For Eastbourne district general hospital, the event was a valuable learning exercise. Dr Atesli has been asked to speak about it at medical conferences. “You don’t expect something like this in Eastbourne,” he says. “But it can happen.”Laura Knight, whose cough lasted for two weeks, still hopes for answers. “It’s really concerning,” she says. “I don’t know if there’s something in my body, and nobody else knows either.”On my last visit, Birling Gap was busy with visitors enjoying the midwinter sun. The only haze was from the waves crashing on the chalk foreshore, the only masks worn by a few Japanese tourists making their way across the car park. On the horizon, the world’s ships plied back and forth.• William Atkins’ The Immeasurable World: Journeys In Desert Places will be published in June.Commenting on this piece?

The problem was that dropping Raheem Sterling for Ilkay Gündogan was such a rare move – removing a forward for an extra midfielder – that it disrupted Manchester City’s rhythm. He has admitted it may have caused his players to wonder if their ultra-positive coach was “wary” of Liverpool and affected how they performed. By 57 minutes the tactic had failed and on came Sterling for Gündogan. Yet if Guardiola did more of this kind of adjustment the team would view it as less an experiment and more the norm and the Catalan would surely become as slick with Plan B as with his Plan A.Despite Agüero’s 30 goals in 39 appearances – 21 of which were scored in the Premier League – Guardiola remains lukewarm regarding the Argentinian. The manager believes City are better with Gabriel Jesus as the spearhead because of the Brazilian’s swifter link play that allows the side to play more fluidly. Although Guardiola is open to Agüero leaving this summer, it would be detrimental to let him go. Could Jesus step up and contribute the weight of goals required should Agüero depart? His figures suggest so but he is yet to enjoy a sustained injury-free period since joining in January 2017. This term Jesus has nine league strikes in 14 starts (13 in all competitions), and last year there were seven in eight. This is an impressive ratio that will have to be continued.Guardiola has Fernandinho, Gündogan, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne as frontline midfielders. There is also Fabian Delph – who is not trusted in the position – plus Oleksandr Zinchenko, who is preferred at left-back. Yet the manager will bolster this area of the squad in the close season, for two reasons. First, Silva is 32 and Fernandinho turns 33 next month so each will have their game time managed next season. Second, Guardiola’s is a fierce football ethos based on midfielders being the prime personnel on which his teams are founded. In saying once that Fernandinho can play all 10 outfield positions Guardiola made the manifesto clear. Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Weigl, 22, is among those the manager will consider in the transfer window.The perennial question of who will replace Vincent Kompany remains despite the captain’s late-season run of fitness which has taken his league appearances to 15 (19 in all competitions). Guardiola hopes Aymeric Laporte’s January recruitment can help provide an answer, as the Frenchman competes with Kompany, Nicolás Otamendi and John Stones for a place. Yet Kompany’s injury proneness means Guardiola has only three central defenders he can rely on for a position in which his system often requires this number. Expect Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy to be shifted across from full-back on occasion but West Bromwich Albion’s Jonny Evans, a career centre-back, may again be of interest.This may be counterintuitive after City were dumped from the Champions League quarter-finals, 5-1 by Liverpool, but Guardiola must not lose courage in his quest for ever more perfect football. Given how invigorating City are to watch, next season’s fascination will be whether the Pep way can conquer Europe, while he tries to retain the Premier League crown. To do so he has to solve the issue that plagued him at Bayern Munich, between 2013-16, and in two continental campaigns at City: how to fill the gap in the XI where he fielded Lionel Messi for his double European Cup-winners, Barcelona. The Argentinian was Guardiola’s genie in a bottle, his go-to when the club needed to pull away from an opponent who came at Barça, just as Jürgen Klopp’s men did at City this month. Guardiola has to find another way, and if he maintains the brave desire to always dazzle, the result could be a Messi-less City who are even better than his gilded Barça."},{"url":null,"title":"tactics pep guardiola manchester city title","story":"Ottmar Hitzfeld, the former Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich manager, used to speak of the red zone, a central area of the pitch just outside the penalty box. Control that, he believed, and you controlled the game. If in your half you denied the opposition the ball in that space, they were forced wide and while crosses can be dangerous they are a low percentage route to goal.At the other end a player with time on the ball in that zone was a major threat, able to shoot or slide balls through the defence. As teams have become increasingly adept at plugging the red zone – often with the use of two holding midfielders – the danger area has shifted. Manchester City, notably, target the area on the edge of the Hitzfeld red zone, the space between the central defender and the full-back.An awareness of the vulnerability of that area is not something particularly new. In a 4-4-2 a forward with any level of tactical awareness would try to exploit it. Perhaps the centre-back and the full-back both think the other is covering and the forward is left unmarked. Or perhaps both mark the one player, leaving space elsewhere. Or if one marks the forward he can move into the other defender’s zone, disrupting the defensive structure.Because they were so terrified of leaving Henry or Eto’o free, defences did not push up and full-backs did not move into midfield. The effect was to create more space in midfield for Lionel Messi dropping off as a false nine and for Xavi and Andrés Iniesta advancing from midfield (not to mention the complication of Dani Alves’s surges from a notional right-back position).City have exploited the same basic idea slightly differently but the importance of those channels between the centre-back and full-back is seen in the way Guardiola, as he did at Bayern, has the City training pitches marked out in 20 zones. In principle no more than three zones in the same horizontal line and no more than two zones in the same vertical line should ever be occupied.If a player moves into a zone that means four in the same horizontal line are occupied, one of the other three should move, ensuring the man on the ball always has two or three passing options. But what is also significant is that iding the pitch in such a way emphasises the importance of those channels between full-back and centre-back.Last season one of the great strengths of Chelsea was the way their structure controlled those channels, their 3-4-2-1 system providing both two holding midfielders (N’Golo Kanté and Nemanja Matic) and two players who were in effect inside-forwards (Eden Hazard and Pedro or Willian), who operated in awkward pockets in which they fell outside the natural zone of the opposing centre-back, full-back and holding midfielder.Guardiola had Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva operating in “free eight” roles from the start of last season, to all intents roving inside-forwards whose forward runs would exploit those channels. The big difference with Chelsea, though, was that City maintained out-and-out wingers (in the modern sense of the term) rather than wing-backs.Guardiola did toy with a back three at the start of this season, although that seemed to be a way of getting Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus into the side in a 3-3-2-2 (or perhaps even 3-1-4-2) rather than Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1. The system brought two wins and a draw but perhaps because the attacking six frequently found themselves strung out in a line as the forwards tried to drop off to create space for Silva and De Bruyne to burst into, it never resurfaced after a switch to 4-3-3 brought a 6-0 win over Watford and a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace in quick succession.The role of Fernandinho in protecting the back four is crucial, particularly on those occasions when both full-backs have been given licence to attack. But there have also been times when the full-backs, Fabian Delph in particular (and most notably away against Chelsea), have tucked inside, with the corresponding centre-back moving wider, occupying precisely those channels De Bruyne and David Silva try to attack at the other end of the pitch.That is useful as a way out from the back – and Ederson’s calmness in possession has been a major feature, notably at home against Tottenham when he bypassed the press with a string of accurate long passes. It also gives City protection against the counterattack although, as the Champions League games against Liverpool suggested, perhaps not enough.City’s domination of the channels at one end of the pitch has been their triumph their failure to do the same at the other end has been their undoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f564153b43b3dd2d6e994e863fe372c8a8241e49/754_248_3253_1951/master/3253.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f6d114ba6822b2f29ef90d8a3d1aa651 1240w","title":"wolves count their blessings after promotion gamble pays off quickly","story":"Rúben Neves plans on staying put at Wolves next season after helping to end their six-year exile from the Premier League and the midfielder hopes an outstanding first season in England can earn him a place in the Portugal squad at the World Cup finals in Russia this summer.Neves has been the club’s marquee signing, with the £15.8m club‑record buy from Porto excelling since swapping the Champions League for the Championship last summer. He is among the players at Wolves who belong to the agent Jorge Mendes but the 21-year-old midfielder admits he is keen to play in the top flight with Wolves, with the club one point away from being crowned champions.Neves has been capped five times and admits his form, including six goals, has helped to put him on the radar of Fernando Santos, the Portugal manager. “Of course all the players are thinking about that,” he said. “I\u0026nbspam honestly focused on the here and now but if after that I have to go to the World Cup, I am happy with that. They have Wolves\u0026nbspTV, sometimes the games are on Sky Sports, so they can see my games. They sent me a message to congratulate me for the promotion but nothing more.”Wolves clinched promotion on Saturday, when Fulham could only draw with Brentford, and celebrated on Sunday with a 2-0 victory against Birmingham City. That win was their 29th of the season and Kevin Thelwell, the club’s sporting director, believes Nuno Espírito Santo deserves enormous credit. “There’s 101 reasons why we have got promoted but the main reason is Nuno,” Thelwell said. “You hear a lot of coaches and managers needing more time, spending more time to pull off a philosophy, nine or 12 months or maybe longer, but this guy did it in four weeks. He deserves a huge amount of credit, he’s done a fantastic job.”Of the criticism of Wolves’ relationship with Mendes, whose Gestifute agency has seven clients at the club, including Espírito Santo, Thelwell said: “Jorge is an agent just like any other. We’ve taken some of Jorge’s clients but also taken clients from other agents. My perspective on it is we haven’t broken any of the rules, we are very clear on that and the EFL suggests we are very clear on that and Jorge is an agent that has helped us to improve the squad, just like some other agencies have.“In the first year our recruitment didn’t go so well and not so many people were talking about us then. In the second year we managed to pull it all together. We took some risks, Rúben Neves would have been offered to a number of people – not just Wolverhampton Wanderers, as would have some of the other players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8ab28cec9aece10b1ea87c75379d096b4b36f7/1471_400_1730_1038/master/1730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a5f3f247fb72c37c4d117babe1b88bc6 1240w","title":"fun finta and why it is impossible not to love joaquin at real betis","story":"Ask the Spanish about Joaquín and they’ll remember the jokes, the dances, the stories. But there’s more to him than thatYou must be Joaquín, they said, and he was: unique, no one quite like him, a cheeky scamp with a glint in his eye, a grin on his face, an endless supply of gags, the uncontainable urge to tell them and, armed with a gaditano accent, the delivery to do them justice. Ask anyone in Spain for their favourite Joaquín moments and their face will light up much like his and they won’t want for one. Or two, or three, or four.Maybe they’ll say the day he was presented at Málaga and decided that keepy-ups were fine but stand-up was better, taking the mic and, in front of thousands of fans, telling a joke instead the time, asked what the best thing about rooming with Álvaro Cejudo was, he replied that waking up to a cup of coffee and a good morning kiss or the night he hypnotised a hen, live on TV.These days, pretty much the only time an interview with him doesn’t end with the presenter saying “tell us a joke, then” is when it starts like that. And somehow, he never lets them down. Eduardo Iturralde González, a Spanish referee, recalls one match during which Joaquín, not impressed with his decisions, sidled up to him and asked: “I heard you got married.” “Erm, yes,” Iturralde replied. To which Joaquín grinned: “You’re making a mistake.” Most, though, will mention that interview when, asked his hobby, Joaquín said tennis, the camera spinning round to see Julio Baptista doubled over. “‘Tennis,’ he says! He’s never played tennis in his life,” Baptista blurts out. “I don’t even know to pick up a racket, Húlio,” Joaquín replies, rumbled and rolling about.Yep, ask the Spanish about Joaquín and they’ll remember the jokes, the dances, the singing, the one-liners, the stories, the times he fell about laughing and they couldn’t help falling about with him. Look up “Joaquín’s best moments” on YouTube, and there will be giggling not goals. Which is great, but it’s also not entirely fair. “I haven’t been playing at the top for over 16 years because I’m funny,” says the 36-year-old. No, he’s been there for 16 years because he’s brilliant, too often lost amid the laughter.When Joaquín was little, he used to climb out the window and sneak down to the local bullring in El Puerto de Santa María, where he took on tiny toros.. One of nine kids, he attributed his strength to being breastfed until the age of six, and it wasn’t just that he said so, it was that he recalled football matches in the plaza where while the other kids would head to the water fountain for a drink, he would head straight for his mum. He stood out young, all tricks, skills, speed and daring, a winger always willing to take people on. Spain’s best player at the 2002 World Cup, a revelation whose tournament ended cruelly, the kid who missed the vital penalty, the image of him staring blankly out of a window more painful because it was so undeserved the leading light in a young, dynamic, exciting side that came up from segunda, he turned down José Mourinho aged 20. “That takes balls,” he said later, but he liked being at Betis and, besides, there were bigger things to come. Or so everyone thought.Included in the team of the year in 2002 and 2005, Joaquín was due to be the next galáctico, but it never quite happened, Florentino Pérez’s promises going unfulfilled. The only Madrid shirts he got were ones he swapped and he had them stolen. “The burglars didn’t take any money, but they did take the shirts,” he grumbled. He never got a medal with Spain, six years in the squad ending in 2008, “and they go and start winning, the buggers!” he said.“I could have done more? Maybe,” he said. “I could have done less too.” He did plenty. With Betis, he won a Copa del Rey that he posed with wearing nothing but that grin, and that presided over the altar on his wedding day. Then came Valencia, via Albacete, where Betis’s infamous, vindictive and very odd owner Manuel Ruiz de Lopera sent him for one day as punishmentNext was Málaga, where they were minutes from a Champions League semi-final. And, finally, Fiorentina, where his Italian was almost as good as his art criticism. “There’s a big bloke there, nude,” he giggled. “It’s a pretty city – it’s just a pity it’s not finished.”And then in 2015, Joaquín came home. He was 34, but it wasn’t the end. This season, in particular, there has been a revival under Quique Setién, a manager who appreciates art and inspiration and who says the key is giving players “something they like: the ball”. Joaquín’s enthusiasm, always there, has been enhanced.A Betis youth-teamer and now shareholder, having invested €1m “because it’s my life”, Joaquín may be older, but he has always wanted the ball. The talent hasn’t gone and nor have the legs. Anyway, Setién insists talent is more about intelligence and understanding than anything else, about knowing and Joaquín knows. Usually considered a pure right-winger, he has moved inside into midfield, more associative, or has played on the left, where the tendency is to come inside and combine.Just after Christmas, Joaquín renewed his contract until 2020 – an agreement he announced, headband on, racket in hand, with a video saying he’s not ready for a tennis career just yet, and one that he claimed was cheap: “I’ve spent that much in shares that the second year comes free,” he joked. One thing’s for sure: it was right. He has played 482 first ision games, including 29 of the 32 so far this season, 25 as a starter. It is on merit at 87, only two current players have more assists in primera: Messi (148) and Ronaldo (88) and his tally is still growing.Joaquín came on to help Betis beat Real Madrid at the Bernabéu he led them in the 5-3 victory over Sevilla and then on Friday night, he set off on the run that defeated Girona, dashing from deep, slowing up, drawing the defender in and setting off again, accelerating smoothly, covering 50, 60, 70 yards before slipping a perfect ball into Loren Morón to clip in a classy finish. “I had nothing left,” he said. “If it had been the second half I’d have asked to come straight off, but it was still the first and it would have looked bad.”When Joaquín started at Betis, the stadium PA came up with a rhyming announcement (well, just about rhyming in sevillano, anyway). “With the feint and the sprint … Joaquín,” it ran. On Friday, that Joaquín returned: the finta and the esprín there again.” “Joaquín provides the art,” El País cheered. It wasn’t just the art, it was the objective too: Betis’s win was their fifth in a row – their best run for over 20 years – and it puts them fifth, within touching distance of an astonishing European place, “top of the mortals” as one member of staff puts it.It’s not just about Joaquín of course. There’s Fabián and Morón for a start, and the shift in recent weeks is striking, the defensive improvement with a new formation and Marc Bartra – this was the first time in their entire history that they have gone four wins in a row without conceding, and it’s 384 minutes since they last conceded. But that can wait for another day, and there is something seductive about Joaquín, impossible not to love, something about the fun in his football that fits this Betis, something about the importance of enjoyment.Not long ago, there was a moment during an interview when Setién was asked which player he saw himself in, just as Joaquín walked past. “Tell them who really makes the difference,” he shouted smiling. “I told him the other day: ‘míster, I’ve kept you here six months. I don’t know how long it’s been that a manager was here six months’.”“I tell you something,” Setién shot back. “You’ve rarely enjoyed playing football as much as you are now.”“Yes,” he said. “That’s true.”• Florin Andone sat on the bench chewing his bib and holding his heart, barely able to take any more, his team-mates suffering alongside him, while out on the pitch Lucas Pérez turned to the Athletic fans abusing him for wasting time with a gesture that said: “What do you expect me to do?” Depor had taken the lead at San Mamés, but now they were under pressure. In the end, though, they did hold on, to secure a second win in a row – having gone 15 without any. Five points separate them from safety. Maybe they’re not entirely sunk yet. • Málaga and Las Palmas are, though. Down in Málaga Isco was wonderful, the home fans applauding and chanting for him to take a free-kick for them.

But no one was much in the mood for celebrating – and not just because they weren’t very good in their 2-1 win over Valencia. “We know that there’s a depressive entorno here,” Valverde said afterwards. “And this week I wasn’t really in a state to think about records. • Damián Suárez.

But it will take more than that to revitalise United. The shapeless sludge of this performance against West Brom was no anomaly.

The question now is whether Manchester City can follow up their achievements next season by winning the prize that the club covets more than any other. Despite Guardiola’s insistence that winning the Premier League was more of an achievement, the failure to add to the two Champions League titles he won at Barcelona is what he will ultimately be judged on. Recruiting another central midfielder to ease the burden on Fernandinho will be a major priority this summer, as will providing extra ammunition to the forward line given Sergio Agüero’s troubles with injury.

Puel’s appointment in October after just two victories in nine games proved a far more adept decision but Leicester’s record of having now lost more games (12) than their 11 wins indicates a squad still failing to live up to its potential. And this is likely to be the last season Riyad Mahrez is around at the King Power Stadium. John BrewinThe focus was drawn inexorably towards Wilfried Zaha, whose switch to Ivory Coast will always have the England setup cursing. Yet another in Crystal Palace ranks excelled in the M23 derby on Saturday to suggest he could yet have a role to play in Russia. This was Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s best performance at senior club level, the Chelsea loanee driving the hosts forward in a dominant opening period. After more than three months out with ankle trouble, the 22-year-old has swiftly recaptured form. “He has qualities,” said Roy Hodgson. “He was very good at screening, keeping the ball. He’s very good at beating players. His workrate has been very good. If he can play regularly for the last part of the season, then we will see him doing more and more as a player.” A place in the World Cup squad is far from outlandish. Dominic Fifield• Match report: Crystal Palace 3-2 Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion• The Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photosHuddersfield defied the odds to reach the Premier League and are on the verge of an even more improbable achievement this season. They will probably avoid relegation from the top flight – beating Everton at home next weekend would practically confirm that – and if they do they will have debunked the notion a team can only survive if they have a core of wily Premier League veterans. Only three of the 24 players used by David Wagner this season had Premier League experience and two of those barely featured this season (Dean Whitehead has played 65 minutes, while Martin Cranie made three appearances before being sold in January). Huddersfield’s players do have experience of keeping cool in high-stakes duels, thanks to their play-off triumph last year, and the benefit of playing for one of England’s best‑run clubs. Paul DoyleMohamed Salah’s 30th Premier League goal this season and 40th in all competitions for Liverpool was not the only statistic that had Anfield purring against Bournemouth. Despite an exhausting midweek win against Manchester City in the Champions League there was no let-up from Jürgen Klopp’s team as they took their goals tally under the German to 300 in 148 games. Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané have scored 82 goals this season – the highest total from Liverpool’s three leading scorers in a single campaign. The manager wants more. Klopp said: “Three hundred is really a massive number. I love watching that kind of football but I don’t want to be the entertainer and it is like: ‘Oh we had fun but we didn’t win anything.’ I know the reason we come here together is to win things but I think the way you try to do it is important.” Andy Hunter• Match report: Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth• Salah says European triumph is more important than goals recordThe best coaches improve players and, by that criterion, Rafaek Benítez must be regarded as exceptional. An alarmingly limited and inexperienced Newcastle squad are up to 10th, on 41 points, having just secured a fourth straight win, at Arsenal’s expense. Since New Year’s Day they have collected 22 points from a possible 36. Much of that is down to the extraordinary progress made by, among others, Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles, Mo Diamé, Ayoze Pérez and Paul Dummett since August. “Staying up is a fantastic achievement in what has been a very difficult season,” said Benítez, whose January loan recruitment of the Sparta Prague goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and Chelsea left winger Kenedy have proved shrewd. “Every week the whole team is progressing and improving. I’m really pleased.” Louise Taylor• Match report: Newcastle United 2-1 Arsenal• Jonathan Wilson: Arsenal fail to learn their lesson• Wenger says Arsenal defeat at Newcastle was ‘a worry character wise’There were a number of variables at work at St Mary’s. First was the bullish strength of Olivier Giroud, whose determination to make the most of every moment led to a change in attitude throughout the team. Then there was the mental frailty of Southampton, perhaps to be expected of a club in deep relegation trouble. And finally there was a tactical tweak and the rare sighting of a Blues back four. Conte’s preference for a three-man defence is renowned, the security it provides being the bedrock on which the rest of Chelsea’s play is built. It also puts a lot of stress on the wing‑backs to deliver from forward positions. Last season they rose to the challenge, this time not so much. Marcos Alonso remains a potent threat but not in this match, and when he stepped back to allow Willian and Pedro to roam the wide spaces Chelsea posed a very different set of questions. Paul MacInnes• Match report: Southampton 2-3 Chelsea• Hughes tells Southampton players to ‘get details right’ to survive• Kirby sends Chelsea into Women’s FA Cup final against ArsenalEvery club in the relegation battle needs a talisman to provide hope and inspiration, and Swansea have found theirs in Jordan Ayew. The 26-year-old has been a player transformed since Carlos Carvalhal took over as manager, scoring six times but bringing far more than just goals to a team who were so prosaic and toothless in the first half of the season. Ayew’s ability to hold the ball up, together with his skill and trickery, gives Swansea an attacking dimension badly missed during his three-match ban. He returned against Everton, playing alongside his brother André, and was a constant threat, linking play, creating chances and scoring an equaliser – his 11th goal of the season – with a wonderfully taken half‑volley. “We know that we will always fight and die for this club, because it has given me and my brother so much,” Jordan said afterwards. Stuart JamesTottenham’s excellent run of 14 games without defeat came to an end against a resurgent Manchester City clearly with a point to prove but Mauricio Pochettino will be concerned that his side can pick themselves up quickly for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United. For all his success in making Spurs into genuine contenders, Pochettino has yet to win a trophy as a manager while it is now a decade since Tottenham supporters were last able to celebrate some silverware, the 2008 League Cup. Even if he has previously insisted that the domestic cup competition would not make up for failure elsewhere, with a top four place almost in the bag before Tuesday’s trip to face Brighton in the league, there is no reason why their manager cannot approach their semi-final full of ambition.

Broad beans are a labour of love in my kitchen – I love the neat green beans, but not the bitterness of their opaque cases – so it’s a double podding affair.

Her cynical, defiantly un-sunny pop anthem New Rules was an improbable song-of-the-summer last July. Streamed online more than 1bn times since, it has helped establish this 22-year-old Londoner as pop’s beach-storming new conquistador – a winner of two Brit awards in February, and the first female artist to be nominated for five. Lipa has an unusual name and history (she comes from a family of Kosovan academics, parted in the 1990s by war), a room-stilling presence (she stands 6ft-plus in heels), and a talent for hanging together pop-music contradictions, specialising in floor-filling bangers that are somehow both jaded and buoyant, universal and intimate. She’s interesting in a number of ways, all of which I want to explore when I meet her one morning in London, towards the end of her Observer cover shoot. Before anything else, though, we discuss her hands.Specifically Lipa’s palms, which are as tough and as work-worn as a lumberjack’s. It’s as if Lipa has spent the week up to now baking bricks, or fighting in a cage. Laughing about it, sighing, Lipa passes her hands around so that everyone in the studio can have a feel. She blames her personal trainer. “We lift a lot of weights,” she says. “We box.” And the crowds on her recent world tour, Lipa points out, wouldn’t just rouse themselves. “I feel like I’ve spent about a year clapping these hands together and shouting: ‘Come on!’”Lipa is bright, good fun, not easily cowed. She asks to feel my palms and after briefly investigating these pearly idler’s mitts she plants on me a brilliantly sceptical stare, as if to ask: have you ever done a hard day’s work? She’s proud of her work ethic. Last week she was gigging in Australia, where some nights, to the squealy delight of her fans, she not only sang but manned the arena merch stands. “It’s a 24-hour job,” she tells me. “And at this point I want to be able to say yes to everything. Every tour, every show, every shoot, every whatever.”We’re in a warehouse in east London, one of those vast places that’s been whitewashed and stud-walled to make it into a multipurpose space, part studio, part gallery. Now that the glowering and vogueing of the photoshoot is over, Lipa puts on patterned jeans and a loose cream jumper, inside the collar of which she tucks a fistful of her dark shoulder-length hair. She needs a tea and a sit, so together we set off through the warehouse corridors to find somewhere. There’s a small glass-walled room abutting the gallery, and as both are deserted it seems a sensible place to put ourselves. Then midday rolls by, and people wander in off the street to admire the art. Some glance through at Lipa, out of reach and out of earshot beyond a wall of glass.It strikes Lipa as she sips her tea that this all amounts to a pretty good analogy for a pop career. Sitting – exposed, apart and a touch ridiculous – in a giant transparent\u0026nbspbox.“You want to be as honest as possible in the music you make,” she says, thinking not so much of her smash single New Rules, which Lipa did not write herself, as of songs such as Blow Your Mind (Mwah) and IDGAF, Lipa’s blunt, sweary postscripts on unhappy love affairs. She continues: “But then there’s the other side of it, when you do want a bit of a personal life, and you get upset that you’ve opened yourself up so much.” She shrugs inside the cream jumper, which unlooses some of her hair. “I guess it comes with the territory – a figuring-out of the right balance, how to be really content, y’know, in this see-through box I’m now living in.”As I said before, she isn’t easily cowed. Earlier this year Lipa read a comment by one of her fans online and took a moment to respond to it. This was as ephemeral as any social media moment, a come-and-go thing that in the end amounted to a few dozen characters on Twitter. But when I read about the incident (which the tabloids wrote up as a minor scandal) I was intrigued, because it seemed a rare example of a pop star breaking character – to remind the public just how silly and how unreal this whole pop game is. Lipa had just separated from her boyfriend, Paul Klein, of the US rock band LANY and now there was gossipy speculation she was back in touch with an ex, a chef called Isaac Carew. One fan thought of the lyrics to Lipa’s New Rules, in which the dos and don’ts of a break-up were carefully itemised (“One, don’t pick up the phone…”).“Sis,” this fan tweeted at Lipa. “You broke the new rules.”“Sis,” Lipa wrote back a minute later. It was the middle of the night. “Get a grip.”Pop should be taken lightly, Lipa believes. “It has to be fun. You’ve got to enjoy it. You can’t get upset about every little thing.” Music after all is the escape – the real world has plenty of methods for upsetting us\u0026nbspalready.And so we discuss geopolitics, and Lipa’s family history. She comes from a large family of ethnic Albanians, to whom “so much has happened”, she says, “in my grandparents’ lives, and my parents’ lives… When you try to come to it and grasp everything there, it’s a lot.” She does her best to boil down their complicated story.Her mother, Anesa, was born to a Kosovan father and a Bosnian mother. In the 90s, war came first to Bosnia, where Anesa’s mother lived, and then to Kosovo, where by now Anesa was living with her fiance, Dukagjin Lipa. Dukagjin was the son of a well-known historian, Seit Lipa, who at that time was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History. When conflict began to brew in Kosovo, Seit’s career abruptly ended. As Lipa tells it: “Once the Serbians came in, they wanted a lot of the historians to rewrite the history of Kosovo. To change it – that Kosovo was always part of Serbia and never part of Yugoslavia. And my grandfather was one of those people who wouldn’t, so he lost his job, because he didn’t want to write a history that he didn’t believe to be true.”In 1992, Dukagjin and Anesa sought refuge in London, while their parents stayed behind in Kosovo and Bosnia. Seit Lipa died in 1999, the year that the Kosovo war ended. “He had a heart attack. And because the borders were closed, my father couldn’t go back to see him.”Lipa was born in north-west London in 1995. “I’ve seen my parents work every day of my life,” she says. In Kosovo her father was training to be a dentist, her mother to be a lawyer. Sudden flight to London threw all this over, and for a long time Lipa’s parents worked as waiters in cafes and bars. In the evenings, her father took business courses. Her mother retrained in travel and tourism. “While I was going to school they were going to\u0026nbspschool.”Flight and sanctuary form the backbone of her family story, and I ask Lipa what she has made of recent political flailings – specifically President Trump’s crowing about his border wall, and before that the extremist Brexiters with their scare-stories about refugees. Lipa says that coming from a background such as hers, “you understand something on a personal level. That no refugee leaves their country without having to.” As for Brexit itself, “I see how important it is for Kosovo, for Kosovans, to be a part of the EU, what it means for them to be a part of something like that. So it’s heartbreaking.” On Trump she takes the long view – very much the historian’s granddaughter. “Later down the line I think we’ll be able to see very clearly, when we put someone like Trump in power, what went wrong. And the hope is we’ll learn from it.”We talk about that amazing name – her grandmother’s suggestion, she says, as dua is the Albanian word for love. “Now I’m proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I’m from Kosovo.” And this in turn made a lot of people adopt a particular expression – intrigued, sad. It was well-meant sympathy, but brutal war isn’t the first thing any kid wants other people to think about when they’re saying hello.Lipa sometimes uploads old family photos to her Instagram, and not a few of them show her parents when they first arrived in London. Yikes! There’s a wedding photo that shows Anesa wearing a headdress of flowers and Dukagjin, who in Kosovo had played in a guitar band, with long rock-star hair. This pair absolutely smouldered. Lipa recalls: “Boys at school would say: ‘Your mum’s really hot.’ And the girls would say: ‘Your dad’s so fit.’ Now I find it funny, but as a kid you didn’t want to be different. It made me blush.”From the available evidence on social media, her parents continue to smoulder. They are great senders of heart emojis, patently still besotted with each other. To be the child of a Really Good Couple, I start to say to Lipa… That can have its own difficulties. Especially if it puts a fixed idea in your head of what love should look\u0026nbsplike.Lipa was 11 when her parents sat her down at the kitchen table with big news. Dukagjin had graduated from his studies and been offered a job in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Lipa was at the end of primary school. “My best friends were all going to different schools. And I told them, ‘Um, I’m going to Kosovo.’”How did you feel?“I was excited. We always spoke Albanian at home. I had my cousins in Kosovo that I’d never met.”And when you got there?“It was absolutely mortifying. Going into a classroom… I remember my first science lesson. They were so far ahead, in terms of mathematics and science. I got such bad grades, especially in the first six months. I could speak the language, but I couldn’t read or write in it.”There was a lot she loved about Pristina. Living there helped Lipa understand she wasn’t just a Londoner, as she’d always thought – that instead she “came from two places”. In musical terms, it was in Pristina that she first got into American hip-hop. Snoop Dogg and Method Man toured through, and these were Lipa’s first gigs. The experience planted in her a love for rap that sat alongside her established obsession with bright, brash pop: Pink, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry. Lipa knew she could sing. Sometimes, in private, she tried mashing together the two influences, putting a deep, drawled, sung-rap spin on her bedroom renditions of Christina Aguilera. She hoped for some formal training and when Lipa was about 14 she sat down with her parents for another kitchen-table conference.Me, says Lipa. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do this on a global scale, living in Kosovo.”You weren’t telling yourself that at 14…OK. But you weren’t telling your parents that at 14…Lipa smiles: yes and no. She came up with “a trick”, she says, selling her parents on the idea that her main goal was to go to a good, British university. “I said: ‘To do that I’ll need to do my GCSEs and A-levels in English.’” It worked, and they agreed. Back in London, Lipa was looked after by friends of her parents. She did enrol at Sylvia Young on weekends, and began recording demos that she uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud.As well as trying to be noticed as a musician, Lipa started a fashion blog. Sweetly titled – “Dua Daily” – this started as a sixth-former’s hobby and was maintained pretty thoroughly for two or three years at the end of her teens. Parts still exist online (Lipa’s voice squeaks when I mention it: “Is it online somewhere? That’s so funny”) and as a document it’s intriguing, charting a young woman’s evolution from wide-eyed kid to a professional London scenester, musing on “how important networking is”. We see her try some modelling, try some acting (at one point in an X Factor ad). For the most part she was forthcoming during this period. Networking, and networking some more, always pushing on anybody in music the links to her demos.Eventually Ben Mawson, Lana Del Rey’s manager, had a listen. He signed Lipa, and started arranging long, immersive studio sessions with different collaborators. (The blog: “I am now currently on a gap year and plan to focus full time on my extra curricular activities. And by that I mean music!”) Client and manager were waiting to hear something that excited them. And the best stuff, tonally, seemed to happen when Lipa’s two preferred genres – moody rap and catchy bubblegum – came crunching together. New Rules was actually written for and rejected by a number of other artists, including the girl band Little Mix. When Lipa tried the track she infused it with something new, a battle-weary languor that made it a timely anthem of millennial ennui. One and a half billion clicks later New Rules remains her calling card, her name-maker. At the Brits in February her performance of the song was the evening’s highlight.She had been nominated in five categories on the night. New Rules was up for best single, and her million-selling debut album, Dua Lipa, was up for best album. In the end she won twice, as best female solo artist and British breakthrough act, which meant two trips to stage\u0026nbspand two very different\u0026nbspspeeches.The first was political. “Here’s to more women on these stages,” Lipa said, “more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world.” Thinking back on this, Lipa tells me it hadn’t gone unnoticed by her that she was the only woman nominated in a number of those other, nominally multi-gender categories… “I felt it was really important to touch on the fact that I’ve always been inspired by women and they were the reason I was stood on that\u0026nbspstage.”Her second speech of the night was softer, wispier – a “chase your dreamsmagic is real” bromide that I now find hard to square with the punchy realist I’ve been taking to all morning. Lipa, not so long ago, was able to step out of the pop bubble and tell a fan: get a grip. Can she really believe in all that dream-chasey, magic-can-happen stuff?Lipa listens to this and says sure. But what she learned from her family’s experience was that you keep going, you keep working, you try to better your chances of better luck. “A big part of who I am,” she says, “has been watching my parents learn to adapt in different places, in different circumstances… And my dad would always tell me: ‘You have to work really, really hard, just to have a tiny bit of luck.’ So to answer your question, I do believe in the romantic side of it. And I believe in the hard graft, too.”She opens her hands: the lumberjack palms.“For me, growing up, doing music, watching pop stars on TV – that felt as crazy as cartoons. Totally unbelievable. Not real. What I’ve learned from my parents is this: everything comes from hard work. And then, maybe, things align.”Dua Lipa is on tour now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5809413639e2a035028130105e888cfb6985d6ea/349_256_3322_1993/master/3322.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f6e6c0174358b474329dddc7e5101314 1240w","title":"lady macbeth of mtsensk review searing and unsparing shostakovich","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonEva-Maria Westbroek’s performance in this vivid revival keeps you rooting for her to the very endIt’s one of the great if-onlys of opera: if Stalin hadn’t found Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk so objectionable when he saw it in 1936, we might now have a trilogy of Shostakovich operas about gutsy Russian women – which is what the composer had planned. As it is, we have only the one – and Richard Jones’s 2004 production, returning to the Royal Opera House for the first time in 12 years, has been away far too long.Revived by director Elaine Kidd, it is blackly funny, unsparing, sometimes shocking and often tasteless, but always on point.

Suddenly and violently, out go the two men of the house in come deafeningly loud wallpaper and a blingy chandelier. Yet what’s more striking is how acutely observed all the relationships are within the high yet claustrophobic walls of John Macfarlane’s multi-roomed set – walls that finally find a grim echo in the towering sides of the pantechnicons in the final scene, transporting prisoners as if they’re livestock. The score sounds searing. Antonio Pappano’s conducting again weaves together the music’s satire – the on-stage brass bands, the tumescent trombones – with its moonlit beauty, and never lets the tension slacken. John Tomlinson also returns to the work, leering and bellowing brilliantly as father-in-law Boris, with John Daszak tenderly wimpish as his son.

But it did not work. The regime did not abandon chemical weapons.Just last week Russia blocked an independent investigation into the Douma attack able to determine who was responsible.She says Corbyn says he would only back military action with the approval of the UN security council.May says up to 75 people were killed in the attack in Douma, with up to 500 people injured.

They are dropped by helicopters. But the Syrian opposition does not have helicopters, she says.Theresa May is now making her Commons statement on Syria.She starts by offering condolences to the family and friends of a solider killed in March on an operation against Islamic State.Coming back to Syria for a moment, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, has released an open letter to Theresa May explaining why he is planning to pick a motion tabled by the Labour MP Alison McGovern as the topic for an emergency Syria debate tonight, not hers.In it, Bercow effectively says that if May wanted a debate on Syria, she should have recalled parliament.Rudd says all Commonwealth citizens will be able to contact the new Home Office team to help establish their right to stay in the UK, not just people from the West Indies.Simon Hoare, a Conservatie, asks if the Home Office will compensate applicants who have already paid for legal advice to help them establish their right to stay.Rudd says she will consider this.Rudd says that, if people have been in this country for decades, there will be proof of that.

One moment we are in Hawaii and she is living, desperately uncomfortably, as a little boy called Charles. The next she is 10 years old and has created the alter ego Keisha to enable her to talk to boys on the phone. Then she is living happily as a transgender girl, a star pupil and captain of the school volleyball team. Now she is 16, doing sex work and stripping at a local club to earn enough money to pay for her operation – or bottom surgery, as she calls it.It is an astonishing story – and we have barely started. There is her move to New York at 21, a master’s in journalism, two bestselling memoirs, a groundbreaking drama she co-scripted and two marriages – and, along the way, she has become the world’s most prominent trans activist. Phew!Mock used to call herself the great pretender. When she left Hawaii to go to New York, she decided to keep her past to herself. “I had to pretend, or withhold parts of myself. Specifically my trans-ness. I had to pretend I was any other 21-year-old. Most of them had not transitioned or had to work the streets or in a strip club, and most of them were not already married. So much had happened by the time I was 21 that I just wanted to be normal and regular, whatever I thought that was.” She finally takes a breath. “Right?”Blimey, I say, do you always speak so quickly? She laughs and apologises. “Oh, I’m so sorry. I’ll slow down. Yes, I do talk fast when I’m excited. And I’m excited because this is a new space in my career.”Her sentences are regularly punctuated with the word “space”, perhaps not surprisingly for somebody who has had to fight so hard to claim hers.Mock is fastidiously polite. At times, she sounds like an old-fashioned southern belle dreamed up by Tennessee Williams. In fact, she grew up impoverished in Honolulu. Her father, Charlie, is African-American and was a drug addict (she had no idea and was devastated to discover when she was young that neighbours knew him as “Charlie the crackhead”). Her mother, Elizabeth, is Hawaiian. The family was broken and dysfunctional, but loving in its own chaotic way. As a seven-year-old, Mock went to live with her father in Oakwood, California. Her father called young Charles a sissy. Mock says she was called all sorts when she was growing up – freak, faggot, tranny, the N-word.She did not see her mother for five years until, at the age of 12, she returned to Honolulu, where she flourished. Her mother never discouraged her from becoming Janet (a name she chose after a friend told her she looked like Janet Jackson). “There were bigger issues in our family. My mom didn’t have the luxury of time and resources to micromanage any of her children’s lives.” It was a blessing, she says – wealthier parents might have paid for therapy to “right” her.Mock was helped by the fact that gender is relatively fluid in Hawaii. The word “māhū” denotes a third gender. It is a pejorative for gay men and drag queens, but it can also have a sense of the sacred attached to it.“My mom, growing up in Hawaii, saw trans people existing every day. She didn’t know they were trans. She was just like: ‘Oh, that’s such-and-such who lives on the street.’ It was the norm to have people who were not male or female people who may be in the middle somewhere.”Mock, now 35, splits her time between Los Angeles and New York. We meet for lunch at a stately hotel in West Hollywood. Mock is gorgeous – tall, curvy, with brown, almond-shaped eyes, a perfect smile and cheek-bones so high you could hoist a flag on them. Despite her sing-song voice, she is fierce and forensic in her arguments.She orders a super-strong cold brew (coffee brewed for hours in cold water) and a steak dish and we return to her past. At 15, she began hormone treatment without telling her mother. Soon after, she started selling sex and stripping to pay for her $7,000 (£5,700) surgery. The only thing she regrets, she says, is doing a\u0026nbspporn shoot to earn the final $1,500. “The sex work was private, but this was on record for the rest of my life.” In her first memoir, Redefining Realness, she wrote that she was “immortalising the one part of my\u0026nbspbody that brought me so much\u0026nbspanguish”.I ask when she started thinking of herself as Janet and she says it is a false premise she always thought of herself as a girl who was cursed by biology. She knew she wanted sex-reassignment surgery, but that was not going to determine her gender. “I believed I was, and knew myself as, a young woman, even when I had a penis. It wasn’t as if I needed the surgery to confirm that for me.”Was there any point at which she felt she could be complete without surgery? “I did not, but that’s just my experience. I know a lot of people who do, and that’s where the burden of representation comes in. I’m sitting here telling my specific story, but though I wasn’t comfortable with that, there are thousands of people who are, or thousands who don’t have access to the funds to have surgery.”Mock often talks about the burden of representation. She might be regarded as a spokeswoman for trans women, but she does not pretend her experience is representative. For one thing, she was fortunate enough to be able to choose whether to disclose she was trans. Many trans women do not have that privilege – their appearance gives them away.She has said that without her smile and her MA in journalism, nobody would have listened to her. “The ‘pretty privilege’ can give you access to spaces, just like your able body gives you access. But it makes impossible beauty standards for many other trans girls who are struggling with that right now.”She argues that trans women obsess too much about being able to “pass”, but she knows it is easy for her to say. She, too, obsessed about that in the past – ironically, one of the things she found validating was one of the things she most despised: men objectifying her.She drains her cool brew, and our main course arrives – steak, brown rice, vegetables. “Oh, my God! This looks really good.” She examines one of the vegetables curiously, and calls over Wayne, the waiter.“Wayne, is this like a sweet potato?”She has a way of engaging with people and dismissing them with self-assured charm.Mock says so much has changed in the trans world since she was young. She hopes few people today need to go to the lengths she did to fund surgery. Would she swap her story for a more sober version? “No. I would have my story,” she says instantly. Is there any time she would have swapped it ? “When I was living it yeah. Che-che-che-che!” She laughs loudly and uninhibitedly, as if clearing her throat. “I wanted a genie to pop up and grant me three wishes – to get all this over with, to have a financial safety net and to be comfortable. But I wouldn’t take anything from my experience because it built my resolve my core.\u0026nbspI fought for every single thing I\u0026nbsphave now.”Actually, Mock says, there was a great support network among sex workers. “The girls felt safe there. We took care of each other. You showed up, you knew who was there and how long she’s gone. We weren’t doing it in isolation. Now sex work had gone online so you’re by yourself all the time.”When she left Hawaii for New York, three years after surgery, Mock chose not to reveal that she was trans. She embarked on a new life experience, described in her second memoir Surpassing Certainty. “If I had disclosed, it would have made people judge me, made them not want to be with me, made me an object, a freak show. I would have been the trans girl in the room. To reveal to a class of strangers the heaviness of my past was just too much. It’s inconvenient. The inconvenient truth! And I didn’t want to be inconvenienced. It would get in the way. I just wanted to go to school to get a job, and move on.”She felt both freed and imprisoned. “The secrecy was hard to cope with,” she says. Mock also became aware of her blackness in a way she had never been before. In Hawaii, she was primarily identified as trans and “everybody was at least brown or tinted in some way”. At New York University, she was one of a handful of black students. “So, in Zora Neale Hurston’s words, I was thrust against a white backdrop.” She pauses. “I love Zora. She is THE\u0026nbspQueen!”Her progress in the publishing world was seamless. Before long, she was an editor and writer at People magazine. But she became bored. She realised she had a better story to tell than the celebrities she was interviewing. And she wanted to own that story. In 2009, she met photographer Aaron Tredwell, who was to become her second husband. “I started telling the people in my life and I was like: ‘Oh, this story is interesting because I’ve never seen it before. This is pre-Orange Is the New Black, pre-Caitlyn Jenner.’ And I was like: ‘I think I should tell my story.’ I’d never seen a young trans woman who was living and thriving in the world, and I was looking for that.”Throughout the Obama years, she says, transgender rights improved considerably in the US, but now Donald Trump is determined to reverse that progress. Last July, he attempted to introduce a blanket ban on transgender people joining the military.“There is a lot of rowing back on protections that the Obama administration put through: the guidelines for trans children in schools trans-specific affordable healthcare the military ban.” She says it is part of a wider general clampdown on rights for minorities.Trans women have been questioned from more than one side of the political spectrum. What does Mock make of the continuing opposition from some feminists?“I think it is rooted in the same thing they say they’re fighting against – biological essentialism. So, it’s saying that if you don’t have these specific biological experiences as a woman you cannot be a woman, you cannot be in our struggle. I would argue that for women to say the only identifying factor of a woman is a pussy is misogynistic. If we’re saying that to be a feminist is to eliminate barriers and alleviate marginalisation based on gender, then how could you not want to include the persecuted trans women\u0026nbspor non-binary folk so you have more comrades to fight against gendered oppression?”She looks me in the face. “My grandmother gets who I am, so when you ask me about people who don’t understand, or people who are on their bully pulpits saying you shouldn’t accept people, I’m like: “What’s happened to you that, of all the things you can talk about, of all the injustices in the world, the one thing you want to concentrate on is trans people living their truth? How is that harming you and your identity? How I identify has nothing to do with you, and how you identify has nothing to do with me. Right? So live your life and let me live mine.”She chews on her steak, decisively. I hope that is not directed at me, I say, cowering. She stops in her tracks and bursts out laughing. “Che-che-che-che. Nonononoo.”Mock has spent much of the past year as part of the writingproducing team on Pose, the new trans drama devised by Glee creator Ryan Murphy. She is also directing one episode. I ask her what she thinks of Transparent, the US comedy-drama about a middle-aged father who becomes a trans woman.“I don’t watch it, so I don’t know,” she says.But it is one of the few dramas featuring trans characters, I insist.“It was never really for me. Just because there’s a trans character doesn’t mean it’s a show I would watch.”But I persist. Surely, if you are making a drama about trans people, you would want to watch what has gone before. “You’re really stuck on\u0026nbspthis Transparent thing, which is interesting to me,” Mock says, smiling. But, now, it is a hollow smile.She quietly but firmly puts me in my place. “It’s about somebody way older than me, who was a professor. Transparent is about a white, middle-class, liberal family, so there\u0026nbspare no intersections that interest me.”What makes her so excited about Pose is that it is about the very people she knows and cares about. “Our show is centring on trans women of colour in a way they’ve not been centred on ever. What’s so radical to me is that, unlike Transparent, where there is one main character who is trans and played by a man, we have five main characters who are trans played by trans women. That five black and brown trans women will be the centre of a show on a network drama in primetime is huge. And they’re going to be on billboards. It’s\u0026nbspamazing this is going to exist in the world.”I tell Mock I have one final question, from a trans friend of my elder daughter. She asked: “How can a nice trans girl like me find the perfect husband like Aaron,” I say.Mock roars with delight. “That is so sweet! What is her name?” Charlie, I say.“To be in a relationship is an incredibly vulnerable space to be in, so you have to be willing to be open, to not be afraid of that intense gaze on you. Aaron was intense he really wanted to know me. And I chose to show up as myself, and I chose to be vulnerable and tell him my story, and that has been the foundation of our relationship. We’re going to challenge one another by telling the truth to one another, then be strong enough to stick around when that truth is not exactly what we thought we were going to hear. I hope that helps Charlie.”I’m sure it will, I tell her, and\u0026nbspexplain that Charlie is also an\u0026nbspactivist.“What is her second name?” Charlie Craggs, I say.“Oh, I know that name,” she whoops. “I’m not kidding. I follow her on Twitter.” Within seconds, she is searching her Twitter account. “Craggs? Cr … Cra … See, I told you,” she shouts, triumphantly.Two cold brews down, and having just discovered Charlie, she is talking faster than ever. “I love that! It’s a small world. Shows how deeply connected we are! Che-che-che-che.”This is who she has written her books for, she says – the next generation. Mock says she has done her bit: she can now go off and write screenplays and be a boring old binary trans woman. It is up to people like Charlie to take up the cudgels. “There are trans girls who are still navigating these spaces and wanting to learn and grow and they need something fun to look at when they see themselves. They don’t just need to know the tragedy and trauma of being trans. They also need to know how to better be, how to better live, how to better dream.”Surpassing Certainty, Mock’s memoir will be published worldwide on 1 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=753d6942c7d2626af14b48ca118c2500 1240w","title":"value of london flats slashed by grenfell style cladding","story":"Home in New Capital Quay, Greenwich, worth £50,000 rather than £475,000, owner toldA homeowner in a housing complex in London with Grenfell-type cladding has been told the value of her £475,000 home has collapsed and is now just £50,000.Galliard Homes, the developer of the 11-block complex in New Capital Quay in south-east London, is facing a £30m-£40m bill to replace the cladding and is locked in a legal dispute over who should pay.The dispute, which could take years to resolve, has left Cecile Langevin, 32, and potentially thousands of others up and down the country, with an unsellable flat.“It is like someone has taken away our life choices, our freedom,” she said. “And nobody is doing anything about it,” she added, in tears.Langevin has a two-year-old son and was due to give birth to her second child on Saturday. She had put their flat on the market in the hope of moving out of London to a bigger home.She got a Rics-approved surveyor to value her flat recently and was shocked when he came back with a £50,000 price tag. But now she realises the whole complex is blighted.“All ongoing sales in the development have fallen through. Banks are not lending to potential buyers and provide valuations of zero for flats in our development,” she said.Langevin is one of about 2,000 residents in NCQ in Greenwich, believed to be the largest private development found to have flammable cladding after the west London disaster that cost 71 lives.“I don’t sleep at night. I wake up most nights for a few hours and I write emails to people I think that can help,” said Langevin.“I can’t move very fast. What would happen if my husband was away one night? We are on the seventh floor. What if if I was there with my son and new baby and all the people were at the stairs and I couldn’t get out?” she asked.While cladding remains on such buildings, the fire brigade requires 247 fire patrol in case evacuation is needed, but in three cases so far in private blocks, including one in Croydon and another in Salford, this has meant leaseholders will face bills potentially of tens of thousands of pounds.“It is quite shocking that the residents are living in potential death traps while everybody else tries to deny liability for the cost of making them safe. There is the potential for the residents to bring group legal proceedings to recover the cost of fixing the buildings and for the considerable distress they must be suffering,” said Chris Haan, a lawyer at the London law firm Leigh Day.He has been approached by a number of home owners in NCQ and said they may have a case against the developers for breach of contract when they sold homes “fit for habitation when completed”.Langevin funded the flat in 2014 through some savings, a mortgage with a high-street bank and a £95,000 government loan under the Help to Buy scheme designed to help people without enough savings to get on the property ladder.Langevin believes that many other homes in the NCQ development were purchased on the Help to Buy scheme, which was heavily promoted by Galliard at the development’s launch.She has had no answer from Target HCA, which is administering the scheme, other than to say it is a “novel” request. “They are being evasive, because they know if they have to do this for me they have to do it for everyone who asks,” she said.Regardless of how much of the government loan she has to repay, Langevin is still subject to huge negative equity because the value of the flat has plummeted.She said she is at her wits’ end and suffering from stress over her situation. She said she can’t move out and rent to others because she would feel terrible “if they were caught in a fire”. It is also not permissible under her Help to Buy contract.She contacted the housing minister, Dominic Raab, but he did not reply. “I don’t think he cares about ordinary people,” she said. It is likely that thousands of private homeowners are in Langevin’s situation, with government data showing 301 blocks over 18 metres tall have Grenfell-type cladding, of which 130 are in the private sector and 13 are hospitals or schools. Of the public buildings, only seven have had their cladding replaced so far.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We have made clear that we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential cladding replacement to leaseholders.“We are keeping the situation under review and ministers are meeting industry representatives shortly to discuss this.”Campaigners said the cladding was causing financial ruin for homeowners.“The blight caused by Grenfell is national and the government doesn’t seem to be too bothered about that. So far, what we have heard from Greenwich and Croydon is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Martin Boyd, a trustee at the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a service that advises leaseholders on their rights over cladding and other issues.Galliard Homes declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc02900b1907fcbf61529ccd20eb0562d42af86/1050_116_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c6bd69b46164f4ed104bd27e5d5228e5 1240w","title":"ben stokes ipl t20 england cricket joe root captain","story":"It’s 6pm at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. A drowsy sun has already slunk below the stands, kites glide overhead and after three hours of intense training in the heat, where he has batted twice, thundered in with the ball for the first time in weeks and stayed late to work on his flying boundary catches, Ben Stokes strolls over for a chat.There is of course one almighty elephant in the ground. We both briefly acknowledge this but it remains just that. This is his first in-depth interview since the incident in Bristol on 25 September last year but regarding events that night Stokes must wait to have his say in court this summer after he and two other men pleaded not guilty to affray. For now it is only cricket, both England and Indian Premier League, that can be on the agenda in the Garden City.The Indian Premier League first, where the 26-year-old is in his second season and at his second side, Rajasthan Royals. Eoin Morgan, one of his two international captains, has recently credited the all-rounder’s MVP-winning stint with the runners-up Rising Pune Supergiant last year for “breaking down barriers” and causing the English invasion that has a record 12 players spread across six of the eight franchises.Stokes appreciates their presence in Twenty20’s great tamasha, rather than with their counties, is not to everyone’s taste back home. The subject of his £1.7m deal with Pune last year – a record for an overseas player – and new price tag at just a shade under, is one he squirms at. “Last year there was so much said about me and the money. I just shy away from it. I don’t want to come across as arrogant. I don’t know how to answer it. It’s just weird,” he says.Stokes is clearly enjoying his time with the Royals. The inaugural winners of the IPL in 2008, they are now trying to rebuild public trust in their first season back as the result of a two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal that cost three players their careers. He has struck up a particular rapport with Shane Warne, the team’s mentor, while Jos Buttler is a familiar face in the ranks. But as is the case with England, all team-mates tend to gravitate towards him.His only off-field struggle in India has come from some of the commercial demands that pack out the schedule on non-match days. “They ask you to do things that are so far out of your comfort zone – it’s just not me,” he says, perhaps in reference to some lively Bollywood-style dancing of his that can be witnessed during the IPL’s numerous TV ad breaks.The feet are moving better on the field even if the returns do not yet jump off the page. His third match against Royal Challengers Bangalore – a high-scoring 19-run win on the day after the interview – is the most impactful yet, with a 21-ball 27 from No\u0026nbsp4, his first wicket of the campaign and a leaping boundary catch to remove Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the RCB struggle in their pursuit of 218.While the latter was a classic case of Stokes making the ridiculous look sublimely simple – his extra training 24 hours earlier sprung to mind as he sprung high – it is likely the bowling that will have given Stokes most satisfaction, purely for the fact he was charging in at full tilt for the first time in a long time.A pre-Christmas spell in New Zealand with Canterbury notwithstanding, the general lack of action leading into his return for England in February had affected his body. Bowling in the one-day series saw wickets follow but he found his legs seized up after spells. Then, just before the Tests that followed, some historical stress fractures in his lower back suddenly began to cause him grief and injections were required.Just 10 laboured overs were sent down in the two Tests that followed the jabs but Stokes says he is feeling himself again to prevent a recurrence he is remodelling his bowling action. The late step into the crease that pointed him to fine leg and left him needing to twist in order to straighten up is being eased out. He is happy with the results but the true test is in the middle.The return to the England camp – he has been restored to the side until the end of proceedings – was probably as smooth as he and his employers could have hoped for. Stokes says the squad’s response felt no different to before from his perspective – “it’s not like we hadn’t stayed in touch” – but admits watching his Test colleagues among them go down 4-0 in Australia was tough. “I lived every moment of the Ashes. I’m sure it was nowhere near the emotions of the guys out there but I was just as gutted.”Readjustment batting-wise took little time either, with one low-key score of 12 in the first one-dayer at Hamilton – “I was anxious. I was guilty of thinking too far ahead and trying to make an impression. It was like I was at the start of my career,” – before a less flustered unbeaten 63 steered Morgan’s side to a series-levelling win at Mount Maunganui.“I was really emotional after getting man of the match in that second game back. It was such a relief to perform and be there at the end. I had five minutes to myself after getting back to the dressing room, sat in my bubble and taking it all in. The lads appreciated that and gave me space. It was a great feeling.”“It’s all about what I’m going to do in the future. I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play. We were so close to being one of the best teams in the world. We’ve slacked off in the past two years but knowing how close we were gives you that desire to get back there.”That slacking off, as he puts it, bottomed out with the 58 all out in Auckland – “It was like the pins in a bowling alley falling down in slow motion” – from which a 1-0 series defeat followed. From being one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies in 2016, only for Pakistan to win at the Oval and square the series, England have five in the cabinet to match their world ranking of fifth.Root, Bayliss and the as-yet reformed selection panel have a job on their hands. The former is battling to turn half-centuries into three figures too – his last nine have gone unconverted – and it is a topic Stokes has been discussing with one of his new friends in India.“But the thing about Joe is he doesn’t bat for himself. If he thinks it is time to take a team down, he will go for it. That’s how he wants us to play as a team and as captain, he feels he has to set the standard.

Hopefully when people read what I have said here they will understand a bit more.”Doubtless much of the heat from the end of England’s sorry Test travails this winter was drawn by Australia’s ball-tampering scandal and before Stokes heads up to the dressing room at the Chinnaswamy, before his new team’s departure from the ground, his views on the topic are sought.“I’m keeping my mouth shut.

This isn’t just true of professional and collegiate referees – all of whom receive the protection of a security detail – but of the hundreds of thousands of referees who officiate youth and amateur recreational matches across the United States, many of whom are under 18 years of age.Referee administrator Tony Crush still remembers the first time he was physically assaulted while officiating a soccer match.At the time, Crush, then only 15 years old, began bantering with an adult league player after that player complained that Crush had failed to call a foul. The banter grew into a heated argument and, moments later, the player attacked Crush, knocking him temporarily unconscious.Stories like Crush’s take place on soccer fields and basketball courts and baseball diamonds across the United States: a 17-year-old frantically phones her father for help as a mob of angry parents gather around her car a 15-year-old girl sits dazed on the field after a grown man has put his hands on her chest and pushed her to the ground a 16-year-old picks himself up off the ground after being blindsided by a punch during a recreational soccer match.While many people acknowledge that the abuse and assault of referees is endemic in American sports culture, few people seem willing to do anything about it, and fewer still consider just how many of the referees on the receiving end of this abuse are still children.Many of the youngest and most inexperienced of these referees begin their officiating careers by working games at the youngest age levels. In theory, these assignments would provide young referees with the opportunity to learn their craft in a more stress-free environment than the one they might find in the more competitive older age groups. The reality, however, is that the younger age games often lead to the most referee abuse.“It is amazing to me how this would be considered child abuse if someone were yelling at their kid like that in a school setting or a work setting,” Hildman added.One former teenage referee wrote to the Guardian about his experiences refereeing under-11 and under-12 matches as a 16-year-old. In one particular match, a coach pushed him to the ground after a disagreement over a red card.The explanations for this abuse are myriad: parents feeling entitled to yell at the referee because of the escalating costs of youth sports the growing pressure to win in competitive youth sports parents, coaches, and players all expecting a level of officiating commensurate with the pros the broader society’s diminishing respect for authority figures.While there are many possible explanations for the rise in referee abuse, there are just as many potential solutions.In Michigan, for example, where amateur referee John Bieniewicz died after he was physically attacked by an adult player in 2015, activists in the referee community teamed up with state senator Morris Hood to try and pass legislation that would have created stiffer legal penalties for assaulting a referee. That legislation stalled despite the urgent testimony of Bieniewicz’s widow undaunted, Hood is reintroducing the bill this year.Yet even if Michigan were to enact stiffer penalties for referee assault, would that really be enough to change a sports culture that dehumanizes referees?“What is the moral compass that spectators can use to understand that their behavior, no matter what they perceive to be the blame of the situation, is crossing a moral line?” asked Chico Villarruel, a regional referee administrator for US Youth Soccer. “What is the civic discourse that we need to have that minimizes prejudice and racism and all of the other ‘-isms’ that we have in our world including the ‘-ism’ of the treatment of sports officials?”Such a civic discourse first requires a conversation between administrators, parents, coaches and players about the proper treatment of match officials, something that sports leagues across the United States are only beginning to incorporate into their programs.Other leagues and organizations are taking even more drastic measures. In Kentucky, one league has begun fining clubs $250 for every parent dismissed from a match for poor behavior, while another has gone even further, banning exhortations of any kind – positive or negative – from the sidelines.Villarruel believes that there may be an even simpler solution for changing the entire culture around youth and amateur sports in this country: empathy.“Ask parents and ask spectators to be a sports official for one year,” Villarruel said, “and maybe we’ll have a cultural change.”In England, one young referee was unwilling to wait for such a cultural change. After years of verbal and physical altercations with players, parents, and coaches, and deeply disaffected with the lack of response from the English Football Association, 18-year-old Ryan Hampson decided he had had enough.Last year, Hampson took the extraordinary step of calling on his fellow referees to go on strike. In March 2017, more than 2,000 referees across England took up Hampson’s call for a strike, earning the teenager an audience with some of the highest-ranking officials in the FA.“I’d say it takes a lot of guts to stand up and actually tackle this front on,” Hampson told the Guardian. “I’d say it can’t just be done by one person it’s got to be a team. There’s got to be a number of officials who will stand up and will do it and will bite the bullet and go for it and not back down. It takes someone who will genuinely have the determination to follow it through and not be frightened of any repercussions that could be possible from the authorities … saying, ‘No, I’ve had enough.’”In a political moment when teenagers across the country – from minority students in Chicago staging “die-ins” at City Hall to protest inequality in public education to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School leading a national movement for stricter gun control laws – are organizing and protesting for their own protection, the idea of a strike by underage referees seems far less outlandish than it might have even six months ago.As Hampson points out, officiating for many is a paid job. If you wouldn’t accept verbal and physical abuse in the workplace, why would you accept it on the soccer field or on the basketball court or on the baseball diamond?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928220a90061daa4b30b79cd2c514424dc4a1ecd/0_128_3543_2234/master/3543.jpg?w=3500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb90c3217a448f809a989e31ca5f4da 7000w","title":"share the dream the games that celebrated disability sports","story":"The 2018 Commonwealth Games was the most inclusive sporting event held to date, with 38 para medal events woven into the schedule alongside able-bodied events. Our photographer  Carly Earl met several of the starsThe 2018 Commonwealth Games was the most inclusive sporting event held to date, with 38 para medal events woven into the schedule alongside able-bodied events. Our photographer  Carly Earl met several of the starsShe is beaming with positivity, and not simply because she topped her T37 class, finishing fifth overall in the T38 final. At the Commonwealth Games she has felt a sense of inclusivity and support like nowhere else in sport.Indeed, for all the feats of athleticism, skill and determination seen in the past 11 days, arguably the most significant achievement has been the way para and able-bodied events have been seamlessly integrated to form a rich and highly watchable schedule. At the Commonwealth Games, even the medals table is a combination of able and para results.“It’s the best idea,” says Joseph of the shared format, which was introduced in 2002. “Being a para athlete, we look forward to the Commonwealth Games so much because here we’re just like any able-bodied person. We get to be with everyone else in the same environment. We don’t get that in the Paralympics and World Championships. It’s so great because it brings the focus on to para athletes. I love it.”What’s more, the attention has fallen on Joseph’s age and her talents rather than her disability: “I have messages saying, ‘You’re such an inspiration, you’re 15 years old and you’re competing with people who are 10 years older.’ It’s crazy,” she says. “And the athletes’ village couldn’t have been better. It was like home.”There were many tales of joy and woe on the track at the Carrara Stadium. Jessica Frotten of Canada crashed during the women’s T54 1,500m final while Madison De Rozario took gold for Australia her compatriot Kurt Fearnley took silver in men’s T54 1500m final, beaten by Canadian Alexandre Dupont by just 0.23 of a second.Humble, gregarious, apprehensive, confident, proud – whatever their disposition and whatever their chances of victory, the para athletes all shared a sense of positivity about the value of para sport.“Don’t look at disability, look at your ability,” Friana Kwevira told the media after winning bronze in the women’s F46 javelin, making her Vanuatu’s first ever Commonwealth Games medalist. “If I can make it, you can make it.”There was even a visually impaired photographer, Andrew Follows, and his guide dog, Leo, on the sidelines at the swimming and gymnastics to capture the action. He too shared their delight, saying his Games experience had been “absolutely epic”.In the para swimming, there was considerable success for Australian athletes. They claimed seven gold, contributing to an overall total of 73 medals alongside their able-bodied team-mates, thereby helping drive Australia to the top of the medal charts.Timothy Disken was one of the most remarkable competitors. Just six months ago he lay in a coma in Canada, with doctors unsure if he would survive emergency brain surgery. Disken suffers from hydrocephalus – the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid on the brain. He roared back to fitness and claimed gold in both the 100m freestyle S9 and 100m breaststroke SB8. “I’m pretty on top of the world,” he said afterwards.In the lawn bowls, Ken Hanson made history as he became Australia’s oldest Commonwealth Games gold medal winner, aged 68. To do it he had to produce the shot of his life in the men’s B6B7B8 match, blasting away two Kiwi bowls from the jack, giving the Australians a last-gasp win.But it was not so much the stories of success that stood out as the spirit of togetherness that propelled the competitors. A fine example of this was in events that paired para and able-bodied entrants, such as Ann Muir, who operated as a “director” for her visually impaired team-mate Sue Curran, guiding her shots in. How fitting it was, then, that “Share the dream” was the motto of the Games."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/071b92d1b288a4c199ead3869c1a546abe84be03/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3c6f04c84f788ffb15e7224623d3b7ce 1240w","title":"cal crutchlow barry sheene motogp motorcycling","story":"In a universe of professional sportsmen and women happy to proclaim the incredible rigour of their winter training regimes, it was refreshing\u0026nbspto hear Cal Crutchlow summarising his very different preparation for the MotoGP season a few minutes after climbing off his Honda in Argentina two weekends ago, having won the second race of the new campaign and shot to the top of the world championship standings.He\u0026nbspspoke of spending the off-season on holiday in California with his wife and their one-year-old daughter.\u0026nbsp“It shows you don’t have to ride motorcycles all winter and do press‑ups and pull-ups,” he said, “because I haven’t done one.”This is Crutchlow’s eighth season in MotoGP and perhaps it has taken him all that time to learn how to relax and make the most of his talent. His performance on the Rio Hondo circuit, in tricky conditions requiring the highest level of feel and intelligence, was that of a rider who has grown out of the years when he always seemed to be having something to prove.On a chaotic day, when a drying track provoked a pre‑start episode of chaos throughout the field over the choice of tyres, and featured a performance of startling immaturity from the reigning world champion,\u0026nbspCrutchlow was the one who kept his head. It was he who best assessed the changing nature of the asphaltrubber interface throughout the 24 laps and who\u0026nbsptook his victory, after a fierce four-way fight, with cool panache.He is 32 and did not achieve promotion to the top tier until he was 25. Contrast that with the most famous rider on the current grid, the seven-times champion Valentino Rossi, who was 21 when he graduated, or Marc Márquez, the champion, who was 20 when he won the first of his four titles and is 25 (and rode on Sunday like a hot‑headed teenager).Crutchlow also came into MotoGP from Superbikes rather than rising through the Moto3 and Moto2 categories, which offer a smoother ramp of preparation, and arrived at the top at a time when no British rider had won a grand prix for 30 years. There had been several decent prospects since Barry Sheene took his last victory in 1981 but none managed to make a significant impact. And he found himself on a grid packed with talent, from Rossi through Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo, Dani Pedrosa and Andrea Dovizioso, all of whom won races during his\u0026nbspfirst season.It was a little bit like Andy Murray trying to break into a top echelon occupied by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, and it took him a while to do it. Whereas the race winners were riding works machines, Crutchlow spent his first three seasons on a privately entered Yamaha run by one of the satellite teams. Gradually, he worked his way up to become a challenger for podium places, despite some mishaps, and in the 2013 Dutch Grand Prix at Assen he landed his first pole position, going on to finish third, a few seconds behind Rossi and Márquez.For 2014 he announced a big move to Ducati, believing only a hook-up with a factory team would give him the chance of victories. After a year of mechanical unreliability and crashes on the Italian machines, however, he and the team parted company. Having gone from 12th\u0026nbspto seventh to fifth in the championship standings in his three years, now he slumped to 13th, behind two younger Brits, Bradley Smith and Scott Redding.Needing to rebuild his career, he moved to another satellite outfit, the Monaco-based Team LCR. There he was given a factory-specification Honda RC213V, as used by Stoner and Márquez to win the world titles in 2012 and 2013. The rehabilitation took time and a third place in Argentina was the only top-three finish in a season when he hauled himself back up to eighth in the standings.After a bad start to 2016, his fortunes were transformed not just by a win in wet conditions in the Czech Republic GP at Brno, ahead of Rossi and Márquez, but by a follow‑up victory at Phillip Island in Australia after Márquez, the pole man, crashed on the first lap. This was the first time a British rider had won two grands prix in a season since Sheene in 1979.If 2017 was a year of marking time, with a single third place and six other top-five finishes, this season has started on a very different note. And now, after adding the points for fourth place in Qatar to his win in Argentina, he is the first British rider since Sheene 39 years ago to sit on top of the world standings.A huge draw in many countries, MotoGP will once again pack out Silverstone in August without managing to attract a wider British audience. This is a particular mystery since, season after season, it offers the most spectacular racing to be seen in any form of modern motor sport, with a compelling range of personalities and nationalities among the riders, who retain a sense of human agency long lost to Formula One.On Sunday, for instance, Crutchlow and his Honda were fighting for the podium places with an Australian on a Ducati, a Frenchman on a Yamaha and a Spaniard on a Suzuki.As long as he is on a non-works machine, the odds are still heavily against the Coventry-born rider mounting a season-long challenge for the title. But when he and his rivals meet again this weekend at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, the Englishman will have a new status to defend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19e744236d19edeb1a8e60a2a9ea97d45e5b61c/151_229_4165_2499/master/4165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8c4c899160d777de052aedb6d5765256 1240w","title":"cornwall once in a lifetime stack stevens stadium for cornwall","story":"Amid the onrushing tide of worrying world news stories, the outcome of a 123-person vote in Truro’s county hall might seem relatively trivial. If you live in Cornwall or have the faintest interest in the growth of professional club rugby union, however, Tuesday is as defining a moment as any in the county’s sporting history.No pressure on Cornwall’s councillors but the decision on whether or not to approve council funding for the proposed new Stadium for Cornwall goes way beyond sport. If you had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to boost your local region’s economy, offer hope to those young athletes not destined to become world-class surfers or sailors and create a lasting community legacy, would you grasp it? Or would you take the view that public money allocated for development is better spent on something other than a shiny ballpark which may never host sustainable top‑tier football or rugby?Not all those voting are sports fans and political pressures also mean the vote could still go either way. The positive argument runs as follows: the council says ‘Yes’ and approves £3m of funding towards the stadium project, which it remains confident the government will match. This would remove the funding logjam that has delayed the much-debated £14.3m project for years.An initial 6,000-capacity complex with a 4G artificial pitch would be in use for 365 days a year, shared by Cornish Pirates, Truro City\u0026nbspFC and Truro and Penwith College. There would also be a health club and Cornwall’s biggest conference facility attached, all on a site with excellent transport links to the rest of the far south-west.Crucially, the money is not being erted from stretched social care budgets or pothole-repair funds. It is ring-fenced development cash which, by law, cannot be used for anything other than the economic regeneration of one of the country’s poorer regions. Among previous beneficiaries of such funds have been the Eden Project, Tate St\u0026nbspIves and Newquay airport, all with the aim of convincing people it is no longer necessary to pass the Duchy on the left-hand side en\u0026nbsproute to somewhere better.The timing, from English rugby’s perspective, could hardly be more significant. On Thursday the Professional Game Board is scheduled to meet to discuss, among other things, the ongoing future of promotion and relegation to and from the Premiership. No\u0026nbspone is suggesting the Pirates would thrive in the Premiership right now but imagine that potential avenue being forever closed. What price then a brave new world for the athletic sons and daughters of ancient Kernow?Perhaps the best person to consult on this cat’s cradle of related issues is Mark Evans, the former Saracens and Harlequins chief executive who has been assisting the bid. Like everyone else, Evans is unsure which way the Truro vote will go but is convinced a ‘No’ will kill stone dead any chance of professional club rugby taking root in the rugby-mad far-west.“If it doesn’t happen this time it’ll never happen unless a billionaire comes out of nowhere. The Pirates will go back to being a level\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspor\u0026nbsp3 side with very little aspiration, and another heartland goes.”“Are we prepared to say the English league will always be propped up by extremely wealthy people? If all the revenue goes out of the changing room door, the game doesn’t grow. All that money could go into marketing the game or improving facilities. Some club ticket prices are getting ridiculous. We’ve got too many games which leads to too many injuries, which leads to oversized squads, which leads to a Championship that is totally dysfunctional. What we are doing to our second tier is nothing short of shameful. All the game has done is ridden the wave of higher and higher media rights. To which I would say a rising tide floats all boats.”Evans points to Australian rules football, which has invested hugely in places previously without an elite AFL club, and thinks rugby should follow suit – how about a Brighton-based side, for example? – if the numbers stack up. “I want the game to be bigger via a managed-growth model, with a closed league and a percentage of central television money syphoned off to build up new markets. Premiership Rugby can’t have it both ways. They can’t say we want to be independent and control our own destiny and not have a growth strategy. I defy anybody to stand up and say: ‘This is working.’”Which is why the decision this week in Truro resonates far beyond Penzance, Redruth, Camborne and every other Cornish rugby town. Here’s hoping that Hellfire Stadium, Stack Stevens Park or the Vickery Arena receives its green light, even in these uncertain economic times. Build it, to borrow from Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, and they will surely come.Here are just a few of the fine, prolific wingers who have played club rugby in France this century: Bryan Habana, Joe Rokocoko, Nemani Nadalo, Drew Mitchell, Juan Imhoff, Sitiveni Sivivatu, Vincent Clerc, Cedric Heymans, Christophe Dominici, Emile Ntamack. It is some achievement, therefore, for Chris Ashton to have broken the record for inidual tries scored in the competition, eclipsing the previous mark of 21 by Clermont’s Napolioni Nalaga. Ashton, 31, has also been required to play 10 games at full-back and 11 on the wing as his coach Fabien Galthie wryly observed: ‘He has been a good find, eh?’ At this rate Eddie Jones will be tempted to dust down the ‘exceptional-circumstances clause’ relating to the availability of English-qualified players based overseas.The Champions Cup semi-finals. Welcome to the Pro 14’s finest hour, with three sides in the last four and an all-Irish final in Bilbao next month if Leinster can beat Scarlets in Dublin and Munster defeat Racing 92 in Bordeaux. Those who fancy Racing and the retiring Dan Carter to progress are forgetting the last time the Irish province featured in a semi-final at Bordeaux’s Stade Chaban-Delmas in 2000. Munster beat Toulouse 31-25 in a game so gripping it still ranks among the greatest European knock-out games.

That tool was publicly introduced in 2016, but the advertising techniques it enables were only revealed in a pitch document leaked to the Intercept.The document, according to the Intercept, describes Facebook’s ability to use its vast amount of personal data to identify inidual users who are “at risk” of changing to competitors’ products, and then target them with advertising at the moment they would be about to switch. “These iniduals could then be targeted aggressively with advertising that could pre-empt and change their decision entirely,” writes the Intercept’s Sam Biddle, “something Facebook calls ‘improved marketing efficiency’”.Tim Hwang, the director of the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of AI initiative, told the publication that Facebook had an ethical obligation to disclose how the technology works. However, Hwang said: “We can’t forget the history of all this, which is that advertising as an industry, going back decades, has been about the question of behaviour prediction … of iniduals and groups … This is in some ways the point of advertising.”The technology serves to underscore the power of Facebook to profile its users and make predictions about aspects of their offline life.That capability has led to conspiracy theories about the company listening in to users through their smartphones to better target them for adverts. Although Facebook has repeatedly denied such theories, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was nonetheless explicitly asked whether it carried out such a practice during his testimony in front of the Senate and House of Representatives last week.“I’ve heard constituents fear that Facebook is mining audio, which I think speaks to the lack of trust,” Sen Gary Peters said last week. “Does Facebook use audio obtained from mobile devices?” Zuckerberg replied with a flat no – but that did not stop Larry Bucshon, a Republican congressman from Indiana, from bringing up the topic again the following day.Buschon said he had had a conversation with his mother about a deceased relative, and later that night, Facebook had showed her a memorial video of the relative. He asked Zuckerberg whether Facebook was contracting with someone else to listen in, and when Zuckerberg replied that the company was not, Buschon pushed, arguing it was pretty clear that someone was listening in.The questions came despite an explicit denial in 2016 from the social network, in a post titled “Facebook does not use your phone’s microphone for ads or News Feed stories”.A Facebook spokesperson said: “Facebook, just like many other ad platforms, uses machine learning to show the right ad to the right person. We don’t claim to know what people think or feel, nor do we share an inidual’s personal information with advertisers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Estimates using data from the Labour Force Survey and the 2011 European censuses put the number of British people resident long-term in Spain at 293,500.France is the next most popular country to live in, with 152,900, followed by Germany, with 96,500, and the Netherlands with 45,300.The data has been published as part of the last of a series of ONS reports called Living Abroad: British residents living in the EU, designed to build a picture of those outside the UK who are affected by Brexit. Ireland has been excluded from the report partly because British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in the UK will not be affected by changes to citizens’ rights after Brexit.The report uses UN migrant data to show that, when it comes to emigration, the UK is the least Europhile nation in Europe. It came bottom when comparing the proportion of the population emigrating to another EU country, just behind Malta and Croatia.Of the EU countries, citizens of Luxembourg are most likely to move to another state in the bloc. That is likely to reflect its size and geographical location close to biggercities such as Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt.“Spain continues to be the most desirable location for the three quarters of a million Brits living in the EU. However, the EU as a whole is not the most popular destination for British expats, with more than half preferring to live in English-speaking countries,” said Jay Lindop, the deputy director of migration statistics at the ONS. For retirement, Spain is still the No 1 destination for Brits, followed by Portugal and Bulgaria, which rocketed up the league of nations attractive to British and Irish people just before the financial crash because of cheap property in Black Sea resorts.Among the countries with most British children under 15 are Luxembourg, Slovakia, France and Belgium.

This week, plumbers, plasterers and electricians will arrive on the island. New windows still encased in packaging are stacked up on the floor, waiting to be installed. A prayer carpet has been ordered.Money and support, both moral and practical, have poured into the project after Rashid set up a crowdfunding appeal. Donations from around the world have pushed the sum raised so far well past the £50,000 target. Professional builders and tradesmen assisted by local residents, some also juggling their regular jobs, are working from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.Now, Stornoway’s Muslims – a few dozen people out of about 8,000 in the town – are hopeful that the mosque will be ready for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which begins in May. “It’s a big challenge to get it done in time for Ramadan, but we’ll do our best. Some things are out of our control, but now we have millions of people praying for us. It’s got a lot of momentum,” Rashid tells the Guardian.Muslims have lived in Stornoway since the 1950s, adapting to an island on which the Sabbath is still observed and churches retain considerable influence. Back then, some became travelling salespeople they lugged suitcases along roads winding through peatlands and past small lochs to offer fabric and other goods door to door, until they had enough savings to open shops and buy homes for their families.But they never had a place of worship. Instead, prayers were held in people’s living rooms and the bodies of the dead were washed in garages. It might be several days before an imam could come from the mainland to say funeral prayers.Over the years, some Muslims left the island for work, to join children and grandchildren who had settled on the mainland, or to be part of a bigger mosque-based community. But since 2015, the dwindling numbers have been boosted by the arrival of several families fleeing the civil war in Syria. The need for a mosque took on a renewed urgency.The community bought a derelict building in the town, and planning permission to turn it into a mosque was granted last summer. But little headway was made until a friend of Rashid’s visited the island a few weeks ago.Rashid runs a construction firm that specialises in new-build properties but also has experience of building mosques. As well as raising money for the Stornoway project, he has negotiated discounts on supplies and called in contractors. “Suppliers have been very cooperative. Most of the people helping to build the mosque are non-Muslim,” he says.The response of other Stornoway residents has been mostly encouraging, according to members of the Muslim community. A woman turned up at the site this week with a cheque for £500. “This goes a long way to show the love and support we have been receiving from the people of Stornoway,” the mosque team tweeted.No members of the local Muslim community wish to be quoted directly or named, saying they want to get on with the project quietly and peacefully. Some are especially wary of the media, which they say has tried to stir up isions in the town over the mosque and has routinely misrepresented Islam.The only strident opposition has come from the Free Church (Continuing), a small breakaway from the Free Church of Scotland. It describes the mosque as a “most unwelcome development” in a statement issued last year that speaks of “the oppression of Christians and the reduced status of women under Islam”, and of “militant Islamists or ‘jihadists’”.The church’s response to the mosque was guided by the biblical commandment to love God, says Greg MacDonald, moderator of the Outer Hebrides presbytery of the Free Church (Continuing). “On the basis of this biblical teaching we object to the promotion of all false religion, including the promotion of Islam through a mosque in Stornoway. God’s right to be worshipped by his creatures in the way he requires must take precedence over any other supposed rights,” he tells the Guardian.In contrast, James Maciver, a minister with the Free Church of Scotland, the biggest congregation on the island, says he supports Muslims’ right to worship. “They have always been regarded by the local community as people who’ve contributed to the local economy and integrated well. I don’t remember any animosity towards them. Outsiders may have got the impression that the Christian community here have resisted the mosque, but that’s not the case,” he says.“I come at this from the point of view of liberty of conscience, freedom of religion. I don’t personally see Islam as the way to salvation, but they have a civil right to a place of worship. I have no right to come between someone’s conscience and their god.”Two Syrian women have been welcomed at his church’s parent and toddler group, Maciver says. “Local people simply take the view that their faith is their business. No one wants to disturb the peace.”Back at the mosque building site, work will begin on the interior once the roof is weatherproof. The prayer room will have a women’s section, ablution facilities will be installed and a separate mortuary will be created.Plans are already under way to invite Stornoway residents to the mosque for tea, to give people an opportunity to ask questions and get to know their Muslim neighbours better. “Christianity and Islam have very similar values, the same values in fact,” says Rashid. “Once we have finished building, we will have an open-door policy. Everyone is welcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a3864d773043cbf1a287b8c0f06fd635f96455/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ac96a1f08ceef08ab33cfdb6fab09e0a 1240w","title":"labour releases advice casting doubt on legitimacy of syria strikes","story":"Advice by international law expert says government’s position on legality of missile strikes is ‘significantly flawed’Labour has released a five-page legal opinion that casts doubt on the government’s case for missile strikes against Syria, warning that the necessary standards to justify military action on humanitarian grounds had not been met.Downing Street published its own legal case for military action on Saturday, hours after the prime minister said the targeted strikes were “right and legal” and would hamper the Syrian regime’s ability to deploy chemical weapons in future. The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, presented his legal advice to the cabinet last Thursday, making the case that the strikes were necessary to prevent humanitarian catastrophe. No 10 swiftly published a summary to avoid the sort of damaging criticism suffered by Tony Blair’s government when it refused to do so over Iraq.However, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said that the attack on the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons stockpiles early on Saturday morning was legally questionable.His deputy, Tom Watson, commissioned legal advice over the weekend after the government published only a summary of its own. Dapo Akande, the professor of public international law and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, concluded that the government’s position was “significantly flawed”.He argued that contrary to government claims, neither the United Nations charter nor international law permitted military action on the basis of humanitarian intervention. He also suggested that accepting the UK’s position on the use of force would undermine the supremacy of the UN charter. Akande claimed that even if a doctrine of humanitarian intervention did exist under international law, the strikes against Syria would not meet the three tests set out by the government as they did not bring “immediate and urgent relief” from the evils it sought to prevent, and was taken before international chemical weapons inspectors were able to reach eastern Ghouta.He concluded that if nations accepted the UK government’s position, it would set a precedent for inidual states making their own assessments of when force was necessary to achieve humanitarian ends in future, with the risk of abuse. Watson told the Guardian, which has seen the legal advice: “MPs and the public should not have to rely on the partial information about legality released by the government. There is a clear public interest in this expert and impartial advice from Prof Akande and that is why I am releasing it in full. The government should do the same with their advice.”The summary of legal advice given by the attorney general to the prime minister outlined why the UK was permitted, in his view, under international law to take measures in the face of “overwhelming humanitarian suffering”. It set out three reasons why the strikes met international laws for military action on humanitarian grounds, including the repeated use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assad’s regime, which it was likely to use again in future. It also argued that other attempts to alleviate suffering had been blocked and there was no “practicable” alternative. It concluded the action was “carefully considered” and the “minimum” judged necessary. Other leading lawyers, including two who held ministerial positions under Blair at the time of the Iraq war, backed the legality of the strikes on humanitarian grounds. Lord Falconer of Thoroton said interventions in Kosovo and to protect the Marsh Arabs in Iraq after the first Gulf war had shown there was a basis for it in exceptional circumstances. Lord Goldsmith, who advised Blair on the legality of the Iraq war, said the government had made the case “squarely and convincingly”.However, the prominent international lawyer Philippe Sands QC questioned the government’s explanation of the legal reasons for the attack on Syria. “There is no basis in international law for arguing that a UN member state is entitled to act in the face of an ‘unreasonable veto’ at the security council, or to act by way of reprisal,” he said on Monday. “Has the UK ever made this argument before?” he asked on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7a1e0118fdc0960ed159b542f046394f847617/785_0_2721_1633/master/2721.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=309e8c8d8e68d47029e7bdd96b87bfd1 1240w","title":"the hague bans marijuana smoking in city centre","story":"Move prompted by numerous complaints from both residents and visitors, says mayor’s officeThe Hague has become the first Dutch city to ban the smoking of cannabis around its city centre, central railway station and major shopping areas, in the latest example of a wider trend towards reining in country’s traditional gedoogbeleid (tolerance policy).Flyers are to be distributed at cannabis-selling coffee shops and homeless shelters to warn of fines for those caught breaching the ban. An English-language version of the flyer is to be made available in hotels.Cannabis is sold openly in 573 coffee shops operating in 103 of the 380 municipalities in the Netherlands, including The Hague.However, awareness of the increase in strength of the varieties of the drug now available, compared with the 1970s when the tolerance policy was introduced, and concern that it is encouraging antisocial behaviour, has seeped into the thinking of central and municipal authorities in recent years.A spokesman for Pauline Krikke, the mayor of The Hague, said the “many complaints” from residents and visitors about the strong smell of cannabis, and the noise from its users, had prompted the prohibition.The spokesman added that the mayor and police had decided there was evidence that “the use of soft drugs has a negative impact on the living environment of residents and visitors” in the areas where the ban will be in place.The prohibition will be enforced by the police, with warnings given to those found to be using the drug in 13 designated public places over the next two weeks.Fines, the level of which will be decided by the public prosector, will apply after that period, and the police will be proactively monitoring the doorways of shops for users.The municipality of Amsterdam prohibits drug use around schools and playgrounds. Rotterdam introduced a ban on use in 2010 around five secondary vocational schools, which was later extended to schools across the entire city. The city has been also been seeking to reducing the number of coffee shops.The development in The Hague is just the latest move in an attempt to tighten the rules around the sale and use of cannabis.Recent governments have clamped down by banning coffee shops in border areas from serving tourists.Last month the Dutch government announced a pilot scheme in 10 municipalities for the regulated production of cannabis, with cultivators recruited through a tender.Coffee shops can currently sell the drug butare not allowed to produce it, which critics say provides a clear opening for criminal gangs to become the suppliers.

It has found a hoard believed to be linked to the Danish king Harald Gormsson, better known as “Harry Bluetooth”, who reigned from around AD958 to 986.Braided necklaces, pearls, brooches, a Thor’s hammer, rings and up to 600 chipped coins were found, including more than 100 that date back to Bluetooth’s era, when he ruled over what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway.“This trove is the biggest single discovery of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of great significance,” the lead archaeologist, Michael Schirren, told national news agency DPA.The oldest coin is a Damascus dirham dating to 714 while the most recent is a penny dating to 983.The find suggests that the treasure may have been buried in the late 980s – also the period when Bluetooth was known to have fled to Pomerania, where he died in 987.“We have here the rare case of a discovery that appears to corroborate historical sources,” said the archaeologist Detlef Jantzen. Bluetooth is credited with unifying Denmark. The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country.But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart. Bluetooth’s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops – the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two runes spelling out his initials RB."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462566.1523813034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps could delay brexit with final deal renegotiation demand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople’s Vote: the MPs Caroline Lucas, Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry want a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGettyMPs could delay Brexit if they are unhappy with a final deal by sending the British government back to Brussels to renegotiate it, according to a new analysis of the role of parliament in the process.A report by the Institute for Government, a think tank close to Whitehall, rejects the assertion by Theresa May’s government that MPs will face a choice between endorsing the deal or leaving the EU with no agreement at all.“The government has a massive political incentive to talk up the chaos that would ensue if parliament did anything other than approve its deal. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear ministers arguing that the only alternative is to leave the EU without a deal – meaning no transition period and no legal guarantees for UK and EU citizens,” said Raphael Hogarth, one of the report’s authors.“The facts, however, are messier. If parliamentarians object to a particular bit of the deal, or to all of it, they could ask the government to renegotiate. The real questions then would be political: could the present government survive this, and would the EU 27 be prepared to return to the table?”The UK and the EU hope to reach agreement by October on two major documents outlining the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the union and its future relationship with the European Union.The withdrawal agreement, a treaty setting out the terms of the UK’s exit for the short to medium term, will have the force of international law once it is signed and ratified. The second document is the “framework for a future relationship”, a political declaration on the terms of the UK’s long-term relationship with the EU.The government has promised to put the withdrawal agreement and future framework, together, to a “meaningful vote” in parliament. If the motion is approved it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill, which will enshrine the agreement in British law.The Institute for Government report says that, although MPs will not be able to amend the withdrawal agreement itself, they can attach amendments to the “meaningful vote” motion obliging the government to seek a better deal.“MPs can force ministers back to the negotiating table and, if they do, the government’s timetable could be unachievable. If MPs were to send ministers back to Brussels to ask for significant changes to the deal, it is likely that Brexit would have to be delayed,” said Hannah White, another of the report’s authors.More than 1,000 people attended the launch in London on Sunday of the People’s Vote, a campaign to put the Brexit deal to the people in a referendum. MPs from four parties were at the launch, including the Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna of Labour, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran.“We have got to get a majority in the House of Commons for the proposition of this people’s vote,” Mr Umunna said. “That means at the very least my party, the Labour Party, needs to be true to its values and support this.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462394.1523798421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"washington we need an exorcist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Exorcist: William Friedkin at the steps where he filmed his horror film’s climatic scene, in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington. Photograph: Gabriella DemczukNew York TimesWhen you’ve got a demonic child in Washington splattering dark stinking bile, croaking gibberish, spewing vulgar personal attacks, lying to sow confusion, whining about the unfairness of the attempts of righteous men to compel the diabolical behaviour and head-spinning outbursts to stop, who do you call? The demon-buster himself, of course: William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist.Before Donald Trump became president the most frightening thing that happened in the US capital was The Exorcist, which brags on its DVD cover that it’s the scariest film of all time. It could well be, if the measure is moviegoers putting down their popcorn in unison when Linda Blair gushes green vomit. “That was oatmeal – the pea soup was just for colouring,” the 82-year-old Friedkin tells me as we have lunch at 1789 in Georgetown, Washington, a restaurant opposite the steep concrete steps where Jason Miller’s tortured Fr Karras fell to his death in a violent struggle with the demon.Friedkin offers an eerie connection to the Trump White House, noting that he edited the film at 666 Fifth Avenue, the accursed Manhattan building with the Number of the Beast at the centre of Jared Kushner’s money problems. The book and screenplay were written by William Peter Blatty, inspired by a news story he heard about in a religious class: the 1949 case of a 14-year-old boy in a Maryland suburb of Washington.Objects appeared to move around on their own in the boy’s bedroom, and he was violent and speaking Latin phrases. The boy, a Lutheran who grew up to be an engineer at Nasa, underwent an exorcism, first with a priest from Georgetown University and then with priests in St Louis.After studying up on the case Friedkin has decided it was “jive”. “It just doesn’t hold water,” he says, eating asparagus soup that looks enough like what came out of Linda Blair’s mouth to make me a little queasy.Friedkin’s career peaked in the early 1970s with The Exorcist and another blockbuster, The French Connection. Eventually he felt so out of touch with a Hollywood possessed by comic books and sci-fis that he began directing operas. Now he has returned to the subject that haunts him with a documentary called The Devil and Father Amorth, opening this month.Friedkin used a handheld camera to film an interview with Fr Amorth, the chief Vatican exorcist, who worried that “Satan rules the world” and was in the Vatican. He died in 2016, at 91. The director, who had never seen an exorcism, also talked the priest into letting him film the exorcism of an Italian architect named Christina with whom he had done the ancient ritual many times.“It was harrowing,” Friedkin says. “These five strong guys are holding her down. They’re sweating. Fr Amorth told me that during one of the exorcisms she accused him of his sins and they were real.”Friedkin took this footage to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists, and one psychiatrist challenged it, saying Christina did not show “the classic symptoms” of possession, such as her head turning 360 degrees and her body levitating.“I said, ‘Doctor, we made that up,’” Friedkin recalls dryly. “Blatty invented what we think of as possession and exorcism today, and I had to find a way to film it. Fr Amorth never encountered stuff like that, but he encountered other extraordinary occurrences and personality changes and voice changes. But there was no levitation or head spinning.”The film-maker says that for his documentary he did nothing to amplify the guttural growl of Christina, which evokes the terrifying voice used by Mercedes McCambridge, which was dubbed in for Blair’s in the possession scenes.“When she breathed into the mic you’d hear five or six sounds come out at once, like John Coltrane playing the sax,” he says. “When I first called her she said, ‘I’m in AA. I had a serious drinking problem. I am a lapsed Catholic, but I still have strong ties to the church. So in order to do what you want I’m going to have to start drinking Jack Daniel’s again and smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs.’ And she wanted to have her own two priests with her at all times.”Friedkin is chock-a-block with such tales. He says the first of his four wives, Jeanne Moreau, installed a lifelong love of Proust in him by reading it aloud. Happily married to Sherry Lansing for 26 years, Friedkin says, he wasn’t really “Hollywood’s most combustible director”, as the Telegraph once called him. “I don’t drink,” he says. “I’ve never done drugs. I’ve never tried grass. But I think Miles Davis is a reason to live.”He does cop to slapping a couple of people to get the sad and angry performances he wanted, noting that another word for director is “manipulator”.He did not want Gene Hackman to play the iconic New York police detective Popeye Doyle in The French Connection. He gave the role to Jimmy Breslin instead. “He had exactly the look I had in mind, a Black Irishman,” Friedkin says.“The first day he was great, great, great. The second day he forgot what he did on the first day. The third day he didn’t show up. Comes Friday he shows up and says, ‘Hey, isn’t there a car chase in this movie?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘You know, I promised my mother on her deathbed I wouldn’t drive, so I don’t know how to drive.’ I said, ‘You’re fired.’ ”He gave Hackman the part, and they sparred so much during filming that at the end he told a producer: “I may get away with this thing, but if I had to do The Gene Hackman Story I wouldn’t hire this guy.” He acknowledges now that Hackman is one of the greatest American film actors.After lunch Friedkin makes me descend the Stairway to Hell, the 75 steps in the movie’s climactic scene that I had avoided my whole life. I saw The Exorcist on my 21st birthday and was so unnerved I went to bed and missed my own party.Standing on the steps, Friedkin channels the demon, growling, “Your mother still rots in hell, Karras, you faithless slime.” Tourists taking selfies on the stairs look around, startled. And even all these years later I still want to crawl under the covers. – New York TimesThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Suspicions raised after journalist who reported on secretive Russian mercenaries in Syria dies in fallJapan’s Shinzo Abe under pressure to resign as he prepares for critical two-day summit with Donald TrumpTrainee barristers docked points for short skirts, coloured socks and \u0026#39kinky boots\u0026#39 St George\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the dragon-slayer became a patron saint of England, Russia and CataloniaDiagnosing patients with high blood pressure could raise their levels Ant McPartlin given biggest ever drink-drive fine as he is told to pay £86k Boy unearths legendary king Bluetooth\u0026#39s trove who brought Christianity to DenmarkTop private school accused of sexism for advert showing boy aiming to be a lawyer and girl as an aspiring vocalistPrince Harry reveals Meghan Markle will take on Commonwealth roleComment: How Russia\u0026#39s trolls and propagandists have turned Soviet disinformation into a terrifying art formGrenfell inferno would not have spread without faulty refurbishment, report finds China sets up English language website urging citizens to report on foreign spiesWatch: Buckingham Palace transformed by rainforest projectionInvestigation raises concerns over US budget airline that suffered five mid-air emergencies in a single dayLocal elections 2018: Polls, what to expect for the vote and key seats to watchThe Queen\u0026#39s Green Planet: the monarch\u0026#39s ambitious plan to turn the Commonwealth into a forestUK accuses Russia and Syria of blocking chemical inspectors from visiting DoumaDoctors call for urgent research as flesh-eating Buruli ulcer spreads in AustraliaUK weather: Britain to bask in 25C with Thursday set to be the hottest day of the year so farThe Moderate Soprano at Duke of York\u0026#39s, review – mild and flavourlessWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"sir tim laurence shaking english heritage hardest part marrying","story":"Princess Anne and Sir Tim Lawrence marrying at Crathie Parish Church in 1992Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, husband of Princess Anne and son-in-law of the Queen, has driven alone in his Land Rover Discovery from Gatcombe Park, his Gloucestershire home, to the Shropshire town of Ironbridge.

The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country.But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart.Bluetooth\u0027s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops - the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two Runes spelling out his initials R.

Beijing offered rewards of between 10,000 (£1,100) to 500,000 (£55,600) yuan for information on spies.Communist China takes an extremely strict approach to its national security and state media have previously reported on web users in the country being \u0026quotlured\u0026quot by foreign spies when looking for jobs and friends online.China established hotlines for people to inform on spies in

research flesh eating buruliulcer spreads","story":"A young boy shows his arm skin damaged by Buruli ulcer in Ivory CoastAustralia is facing a “rapidly worsening epidemic” of  gruesome flesh-eating ulcers that have baffled experts and prompted calls for urgent medical research to uncover the cause.Scientists said the Buruli ulcer, a bacterial infection which is most commonly seen in tropical parts of Africa, is being reported in increasing numbers in “temperate” rural areas in the state of Victoria. The number of annual cases has increased more than 400 per cent, with a record 182 cases reported in 216 and 236 in the first 11 months of 2017.“The community is facing a worsening epidemic, defined by cases rapidly increasing in number,  becoming more severe in nature, and occurring in new geographic areas,” said an article on the outbreak in the Medical Journal of Australia.The infection typically starts as a sore on the arm or leg that fails to heal and slowly enlarges, causing severe lesions of the skin and potentially requiring amputations. Sufferers often initially dismiss the initial symptoms as an insect bite.A severe ulcer on the knee of an 11-year-old boy, which took six months to heal\u0026quotIt can really become very severe and eats away at the skin and soft tissue … leading to, often, long-term cosmetic deformities, even mobility issues and occasionally it\u0027s actually associated with death,\u0026quot Professor Daniel O\u0027Brien, the article’s lead author and an infectious diseases expert, told ABC News.The outbreak has occurred in coastal areas in Victoria, including the Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas. But it has also reportedly spread to some suburbs in Melbourne, the country’s second-largest city. It is believed to be the only current outbreak in the developed world.Scientists have called for urgent funding to research the causes of the outbreak. The infection is believed to spread via mosquitoes and possums.\u0026quotWe actually don\u0027t know for sure — we have some clues about what may be the causes, but nobody really knows why it\u0027s located here, why it moves into new areas, and in fact how we catch it,\u0026quot Professor O’Brien said.Known as Mycobacterium ulcerans, the infection can often be treated with antibiotics, though  severe cases can require surgery or amputation.Possum and mosquitoes are believed to help spread the diseaseGus Charles, a 12-year-old, developed a lump on his knee after visiting the Mornington Peninsula for a family holiday.  Several doctors misdiagnosed it before a surgeon sliced into the lump and found a “huge pus-filled abscess”, according to a report in Fairfax Media.Gus eventually underwent plastic surgery and spent six months recovering. \u0026quotWhen I first saw it after surgery I fainted because it was pretty bad,\u0026quot he told ABC News.His mother, Sally, told Fairfax Media: “He complained about it a bit, but he’s a pretty tough kid.

In BRE’s opinion … there would have been little opportunity for a fire in a flat of Grenfell Tower to spread to any neighbouring flats.” One of the flats in the Grenfell Tower which was destroyed by the fire The report details how the 2014-2016 refurbishment failed to meet several major fire safety standards set out in the building regulations. The window frames were too small for the hole meaning that rubberised membrane, rigid foam insulation and uPVC lightweight plastic panels were used to fill that gap and “none of the materials used would be capable of providing 30 minutes fire resistance”.Instead the materials provided a \u0026quotfuel\u0026quot which allowed the fire to spread to the facade, it is said. The cavity barriers, which were meant to close the gap between the concrete building and the external cladding in the event of a fire, were too small to do so and some were installed upside down or back to front. This created a chimney-like effect, it is said.  The insulation on the outside of the building was combustible and “provided a medium for fire spread up, across and within sections of the facade”, the BRE report found. Grenfell Tower fire in picturesFurthermore, the aluminium composite material used in the outside panels of the cladding had a polyethylene (plastic) core that “appears to be highly combustible” and “appears to have provided a medium for fire spread up and across the facade\u0026quot. Each breach relating to the cladding system is of far greater importance when “considered in combination as opposed to when they occur in isolation”, BRE notes. The report found that, contrary to building regulations, many of the doors did not have closers on them so as people fled their doors remained open allowing large quantities of fire and smoke to get into the communal areas. Firefighting facilities were also said to be deficient as there was only enough room for one engine to get close to the building. BRE also noted the absence of a sprinkler system and the fact that the tower\u0027s only stairwell was 8cm too narrow  but says that they did not contribute to the loss of life.It details how the fire started in a fridge freezer in flat 16 just one metre from an open window. It then could have either caught the materials around the window, the insulation or the combustible material in the cladding panels, or a combination of the three, experts say. This allowed the flames to enter the cavity between the concrete and the facade and the lack of cavity barriers created a chimney-like effect. As well as spreading upwards and laterally the fire spread downward fire spread because of \u0026quotburning droplets of polyethylene falling and igniting combustible materials below”.The faulty windows then allowed the fire to enter the other flats and the lack of door closers meant it could spread into the stairwell. The fire was so ferocious that had the original building not been built to such strict standards, it is likely it would have collapsed, the experts say. The BRE was asked to look at the fire by the Metropolitan Police to try and establish the circumstances surrounding as many of the 71 deaths as possible, and failings in duty of care to residents, and to provide expert witness support to any criminal prosecution of public inquiry. Suspicions raised after journalist who reported on secretive Russian mercenaries in Syria dies in fallJapan’s Shinzo Abe under pressure to resign as he prepares for critical two-day summit

empire","story":"A great deal of modern science was built on exploitation, as European empires justified colonial activities through the ‘gifts’ of medical advancement. Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversation.comor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas, and that is what has happened with this far right rhetoric in this country,” he said.Amid rising anger on all sides of the Commons, the home secretary announced a new taskforce with the aim of ensuring the Windrush generation receive the paperwork they need to confirm their immigration status within two weeks.And she said the fees involved in going through the process – which is £229 for each application – would be waived.Ms Rudd said there should be no doubt that people who arrived in Britain decades ago – often as children – “have the right to reside here lawfully”.MPs call on Theresa May to solve \u0027Windrush immigration crisis\u0027May to be grilled by MPs two days after Syria air strikesNow Theresa May must provide a plan for the future on foreign policyOnly a quarter of Britons back military action in Syria“Some of the way they have been treated has been wrong, has been appalling, and I am sorry,” she told MPs, during Home Office questions.The home secretary also made an astonishing implied criticism of her predecessor – and now boss – who introduced the self-described “hostile environment” for suspected illegal immigrants.She suggested the Home Office had become “too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”, in the recent past.“We have seen the inidual stories and they have been, some of them, terrible to hear - and that is why I have acted,” Ms Rudd said.The changes, demanding extra documentation from people who often arrived in the UK many decades ago, and consider themselves British, were introduced by Ms May in 2012.Some people have been threatened with deportation to countries they left as children 50 years ago and have not returned to since – or, it is feared, have already been sent there.Others have been denied access to healthcare, lost jobs, or been made homeless as they do not have sufficient paperwork to prove they have the right to be in the UK.Although anyone living in the UK continuously since before January 1 1973 is legally entitled to live in the UK, people who have not applied for passports.Some people moved before the countries they were born in became independent, and assumed that they were British.The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates that some 50,000 Commonwealth-born people in the UK, who arrived before 1971, may not yet have regularised their residency status.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017.

I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone.

When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.The wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.

Bangladesh has given Myanmar a list of more than 8,000 refugees to begin the repatriation, but the return has been delayed by a complicated verification process. The two countries agreed in December to begin repatriating the refugees in January, but there were concerns among aid workers and Rohingya that they would be forced to return and face unsafe conditions in Myanmar. Hundreds of Rohingya were reportedly killed in the recent violence, and many houses and villages burnt to the ground. The United Nations and the US have described the army crackdown as “ethnic cleansing”. On Friday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Bangladesh finalised a memorandum of understanding that describes the repatriation process as “safe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards”. Photos ‘show dozens of burned Muslim villages being bulldozed’The UNHCR said it considers that “conditions in Myanmar are not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable. The responsibility for creating such conditions remains with the Myanmar authorities, and these must go beyond the preparation of physical infrastructure to facilitate logistical arrangements.” Earlier in the week, Myanmar social welfare minister Win Myat Aye met with about 40 Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong camp in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh for more than an hour, sometimes exchanging heated words. A Rohingya leader, Abdur Rahim, said at least eight rape victims were among the group.Mr Rahim said the group presented 13 demands for the government to meet for their return to Myanmar. Rohingya refugees – in picturesRohingya refugees – in picturesA young girl and a baby wade through mud after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from Burma on 10 SeptemberRohingya refugees walk through a camp in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after arriving from BurmaA young Rohingya refugee gathers firewood after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from BurmaRohingya refugees wait for sacks of rice to be distributed in Whaikhyang, BangladeshRohingya Muslim refugees arrive on a boat in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after crossing from Burma on 8 SeptemberRohingya Muslim refugees react after being re-united with each other after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees walk along the remains of a road after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Myanmar Rohingya Muslim refugees stand in the rain after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaIndian children hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in BurmaSupporters of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), an Islamic organisation, listen to their leaders\u0027 speeches against Burma\u0027s persecution of Rohingya Muslims, during a demonstration in KarachiHundreds of Iranians take part in a protest against violence in Myanmar after weekly Friday prayers, in TehranIndonesian Muslim activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya minority in Magelang, Central Java, IndonesiaMembers of an Islamic organisation shout slogans against the Burma government during a protest in Dhaka, BangladeshThe refugees apparently became angry when told they must accept national verification cards provided by Myanmar that state they are migrants from Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims have long been treated as outsiders in Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. Mr Rahim said they demanded to be recognised as citizens of Myanmar before the repatriation starts and that their security arrangements be supervised by the UN. Rohingya who have been repatriated in the past after previous refugee exoduses have been forced to live in camps in Myanmar. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
