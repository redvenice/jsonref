If there was, say, a Sickert show in Manchester, in 20 years’ time you could look back and see that show.”With so many art exhibitions being cancelled, the new tool will allow galleries to put on display the shows they wanted the public to see.The tool will be ready by May. “We are really excited,” said Ellis. “We’re sad that it isn’t ready now, but going forward it will be one of the critical ways we can help collections.”People who curate their own shows will be able to choose if they want the whole world to see it or just their friends.If someone wanted to curate a show devoted to the artist with more paintings in British collections than any other, they would alight on the unlikely figure of John Everett.The Dorset-born artist was, in the early 20th century, a prolific painter of boats, decks, harbours and seascapes. Relatively unknown today, an astonishing 1,058 of his works are in public collections, the vast majority owned by the National Maritime Museum but also five in the Laing art gallery collection in Newcastle.The database already has lots of tags and stories to make searching easier. The parrot enthusiast, for example, could find 61 works, from Tiepolo’s A Young Woman with a Macaw in the Ashmolean’s collection in Oxford, to Maggi Hambling’s untitled portrait of a man and his parrot owned by Southampton city art gallery.Ellis said they might also ask artists and celebrities to create online shows. “We could, for example, ask Jarvis Cocker to choose his favourite paintings in Sheffield.”The curation tool is being funded by the Ampersand Foundation and is the latest step for a small charity with big ambitions.Art from 3,300 collection venues by 45,000 artists is on the database. The current big project is adding every sculpture, with around 16,000 already on it, and Ellis hopes to have all 80,000 by the end of the year. Fortunately, most of the photography has already been done.The exercise has allowed Art UK to highlight fascinating stories behind many artworks.For example, this week there was the centenary of the public unveiling of a sculpture of a woman who was a hugely well known in her day, less so now.The sculpture of nurse Edith Cavell stands opposite the National Portrait Gallery in London, made by the leading British sculptor Sir George Frampton, and bears her famous words: “Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness for anyone.”Cavell was a nurse during the first world war who cared for countless soldiers regardless of their nationality. While helping allied soldiers flee occupied Belgium she was captured by the Germans. Despite an international outcry for her release, Cavell was shot at dawn by a firing squad.It provoked outrage in Britain, with the Manchester  headlining the story: “Merciless Execution of Nurse Cavell.” Her story was used in British propaganda to galvanise public opinion, with the recruitment of soldiers doubling after her death.It also inspired numerous artworks, with paintings in the Wellcome Collection and the Imperial War Museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72f12ff90f42d94cf88a5968f9e9c1067a34454/0_591_1643_986/master/1643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0217563d9bf7ee1307089a7488f919cb","title":"build bulldoze rebuild chinas dizzying changes in pictures teresa eng","story":"From bridges to flowers, from cities to gorges, Teresa Eng spent four years exploring her ancestral roots in China, capturing a country modernising at breakneck speed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/531c405a6213fbc236b3446e71b64541b262b5b6/0_1122_3373_2023/master/3373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91f58f66250ae1f0a83e3f22acee35ad","title":"inferno by catherine cho review","story":"‘In hell’ ... an unforgettable account of postpartum psychosis and a mother’s spell on a psychiatric ward“Through my dread and my fear, I saw the beauty in them, the patterns in the universe. I could tell it was dangerous, this raw energy, this coursing feeling, and for a moment, I wished I could tumble in, tumble into the madness.”Catherine Cho’s episode of postpartum psychosis came on when her baby was three months old. She and her husband James had taken Cato to America from their home in London to introduce him to his relatives. Everywhere they went, their Korean families told them off for defying the Korean custom of keeping the baby inside for the first 100 days and risking his health during the flu season. Cho took on their anxiety, doubting her own ability to cope. Then one day she saw Cato’s eyes as devils’ eyes. Within hours, she lost all sense of time, imagining herself as her own grandmother and her son’s child, and became convinced she was in hell and that her son was going to die as expiation for their sins. By the time she was sectioned, she had forgotten who she was.Inferno is a brilliantly frightening memoir about Cho’s two weeks on the psychiatric ward, elegantly interwoven with tales from her past. We hear about her childhood, raised by Korean parents in an austerely silent American home, where Cho had to protect her brother from her father’s violent rages. We hear about her relationship with a near-murderous boyfriend, and then about her courtship with James, whose kindness promised to erase the past. There’s no easy cause and effect here, no suggestion that past trauma causes the psychotic breakdown. But the past experiences resonate, and in fleeing her vulnerable son Cho also flees her own vulnerable younger self.Insights of this kind are rarely explicit. Cho’s language is poetically associative and points are made through suggestive juxtaposition. Fragmentary structures can feel merely fashionable, but here it feels hard won, allowing Cho to juxtapose everyday reportage about life in a psychiatric ward with more florid accounts of her psychosis. While Cho paces, expresses milk to alleviate her painful breasts, and writes frenetically in the notebook where she is reconstructing her memories, she observes the other inmates, many of whom have no homes to return to. She notices that it’s the race majority in the TV room who gets to be in charge of the remote control. And she learns the rules. As in prison, you never ask another resident why they are there.Arguably, by the time Cho is observing this, she has ceased to be as ill as she was when admitted. Indeed, the intelligent curiosity with which she observes the ward becomes a crucial part of her recovery. Given the brevity of her psychological problems, she may not have much new to tell us about psychosis. But the real strength of the book is its revelations about motherhood and mental illness. Running through her psychosis is fear about herself as a mother. She fears for her baby and that she will forget she’s a mother altogether. These are common anxieties, and one of the book’s most compelling suggestions is that even ordinary motherhood resembles psychosis. The sense of being outside time, the terror of being responsible for another life, the feeling that the word “mother” defines us and yet remains dissociated from much of our mental life: these are familiar feelings, and yet Cho’s book reminds us how close they are to psychological illness, especially when you add in the immigrant’s feeling of living in parallel realities. Korean traditions and stories thread through the book, adding to the feeling that the reality Cho is now accustomed to – being a middle-class mother in Britain – is only another story, which might turn out to be as unreal as the fantastical folktales she’s grown up with.In the end, Cho goes against Korean tradition by believing in love. “As for love,” she writes at one point, it is seen by her relatives as “an unfortunate passion, irrational and destructive”, partly because “any happiness must be bought with sorrow”. She comes to believe that it’s her love for James that takes her into psychosis, because her attachment to him becomes the site of her vulnerability, and that pulls her out again. Her love for Cato is more elusive – and among the book’s strengths is its bravery in admitting that the “fierce, possessive affection” she feels for her baby is very different from the kind of in‑love feeling she expected. When love fails, she has to remake her relationship with Cato.

It comes amid shortages of hand sanitiser, which has been flagged as an important tool in combating the coronavirus.HMRC said it was prioritising applications from manufacturers to enable them to produce denatured alcohol, a type of spirit that is not for human consumption and exempt from excise duty. A range of chemicals is added to the alcohol to render it undrinkable.Many supermarkets and chemists have placed strict limits on the number of hand sanitising gels shoppers can buy as producers struggle to source enough ingredients and small plastic bottles.With heavy demand, independent gin producers have also been switching their production. Verdant Spirits, based in Dundee, is reportedly aiming to produce 400 litres of the gel starting this week, while Bristol’s Psychopomp Microdistillery and 58 Gin in London are also working on similar products.In France, the luxury goods group LVMH has switched to producing hand sanitiser at three of its perfume and cosmetics factories for distribution to French hospitals fighting coronavirus.Twelve tonnes will be produced as soon as this week, instead of the usual Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy scents and make-up usually made at the three French sites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d171b0e03cc245cccf205ed7c89c082b4d0de2/0_56_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7342fb27e2227f4fdc0491dc484aced","title":"ocado online shopping expected to impose rationing on more products","story":"Online shopping firm to reopen on Saturday with ‘fairer distribution of goods’ amid coronavirus crisisOcado is expected to increase rationing on its site when it reopens on Saturday as it tries to cope with overwhelming demand for grocery home deliveries.The online grocer is already limiting sales of about 500 products but signalled that was likely to increase as it sought to “ensure a fairer distribution of our capacity” to shoppers.Ocado stopped taking orders on Wednesday and will not start taking new orders until the weekend. All its delivery slots had already been fully booked.“The decision to close was not because we could not cope,” said the group’s finance director, Duncan Tatton-Brown. “The website closed so we could make changes to the code that supports it to enable us to share our capacity in a more fair and accessible way. You can imagine some people are ordering a much larger basket and it’s only right for us to consider a fairer allocation. We need to find a way to make it fairer.”Tatton-Brown declined to give further details – other supermarkets have already removed multi-buys amid panic-buying that has stripped shelves – because it wanted to “communicate with customers in a coherent way”.The changes being made will also seek to support vulnerable Britons who have been forced to self-isolate. “We will try and do the right thing for those who are vulnerable, be that because of age or because of some health condition,” he added. “One of the reasons for closing the site is to do more of that.”The retailer has been inundated with orders in recent weeks, leading to the introduction of a queuing system on the site. “We were experiencing four times the demand of our highest-ever peak,” said Tatton-Brown.“Our systems thought they were experiencing a denial of service attack. We have had hours in the week when we have had 100 times the normal level of transactions on the website.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b83ea3a22b971eea7e7d2969f780242fb843cd/0_180_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7e4480641b790fb90ca0be0f756d2b3","title":"coronavirus pandemic human rights","story":"People could soon be arrested for a sweeping range of new offences, sparking troubling scenes in the UK• See all our coronavirus coverageYou can learn a lot about someone’s perspective from what they find reassuring at a time like this. This week I saw a private briefing from a bank, soothingly reassuring its clients that “this feels more like 911 than 2008”. I think the point was to let investors know that this crisis is not systemic. It felt a bit like updating the old wartime spirit for today’s hyper-capitalist economy: “Keep well-capitalised, and carry on.”I can think of a host of reasons why 911 does not bring calming thoughts to mind, but one is the long-term impact it had on human rights. Back then I was in the early stages of becoming a human rights lawyer. My very first day in court was with the team defending a victim of extraordinary rendition, where Britain had helped facilitate his torture. By the time I was practising, the 7 July London bombings had happened, and so had draconian new laws – 90-day detention without trial, plus sweeping surveillance and monitoring. Many Muslims remember this as the time that racial profiling and state harassment – in airports, on the tube, in the street – became the new normal.This might sound like a strange issue to raise when the national priority is – understandably – how to stop the spread of coronavirus, treat the sick and tackle the hit to the economy. But since last month, when the government drafted emergency regulations to grant police new powers – and more far-reaching laws are expected this week – the potential has been building for a clash between liberty, privacy and public health measures. The authorities now have the power to arrest and detain someone they believe is infectious for up to 14 days, to move that person around from custody facilities including secure hospitals, and to take blood or saliva from them by force, even if they are a child.The legislation set to come before parliament is likely to ban public gatherings, to widen police and immigration officer powers of detention and restraint, to give doctors powers to sign death certificates without seeing the deceased person’s body, to allow fast-tracked burial and cremation, and to strip back services in care homes. People who refuse to self-isolate could be made to do so using the always contested “reasonable force”.Our human rights protections – long maligned by many of the politicians now running our pandemic-stricken nation – were designed for moments such as this. They contain specific exemptions for situations in which the state needs to contain the spread of infectious disease. And the continuing shutdown caused by coronavirus doesn’t make them less relevant, it makes them more important than ever.The proposed measures will contain safeguards – as they are constitutionally required to do so – especially rights to appeal. But this being a government that has decimated legal aid, brought our court system to its knees and repeatedly attacked the judiciary, a key element of trust is already compromised.Trust is one of those ingredients in a democratic process that is hard to notice until it is gone. But this government’s cavalier approach to applying the rule of law at the best of times – let’s remember the prime minister misled the Queen and illegally prorogued parliament – does not inspire confidence at a time of crisis.Lawyers who focus on the right to human dignity in the care of vulnerable or elderly people were appalled to hear Boris Johnson suggest that the deaths of vast numbers of British people would be an acceptable price to pay for so-called “herd immunity”. One QC compared the idea to Germany’s post-911 attempt to permit hijacked passenger planes to be shot down, as if the lives of those on board were expendable. Similarly, he suggests, the very idea of herd immunity would have “subordinated human dignity by treating it as a quantifiable entity that can be measured and weighed in the balance.”There’s the potential for a kind of tyranny of the majority – one of the reasons we need human rights in the first place – and then there are the new, established but upgraded, tyrannies of the state. China has developed an app of remarkably intrusive proportions, using facial recognition to track both your movements and those of everyone in your proximity, so that they can be tested in the event you become infectious.Israel is ditching superfluous apps altogether and simply allowing security services to hack infected people’s phones to monitor their movements.Donald Trump has insisted on a project of deliberate racial demonisation by calling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” – inflaming what we already know to be harmful prejudice against east Asian people, including those who have suffered shameful abuse in Britain. In one of the most surreal responses to the pandemic, commentators who are usually allergic to this form of social justice have belatedly discovered the concept of reparations – not for the genocidal abuses committed by Europeans over the centuries, but for Europeans from the allegedly guilty Chinese. The truth is that China has been remarkably effective at stemming the spread of Covid-19, but has done so through a heady concoction of human rights abuses and authoritarian rule, of which no one should be envious. Human Rights Watch has reported censorship dissenters put “under quarantine” a disabled child left to die when his parent was forced into isolation and a leukaemia sufferer turned away from hospital. That doesn’t justify racism against Chinese people any more than the British should be stigmatised for the uniquely dodgy leadership we currently endure. This pandemic has exposed what many of us said about the Tories’ long boast of “record high” numbers of people in employment – namely, insecure workers with no rights and no safety net. Likewise, we warned about starving the NHS so that its resilience is shot, creating a generation of renters with no savings, and allowing homelessness and destitution to mushroom.These casualties had already become the new normal. But once we see newly troubling scenes – people arrested for resisting isolation or treatment – we will be reminded why this could become a crisis of rights, as much as it is one of disease."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a25ee0c120766b6eebb8caa91b1fa2105ea5164/0_101_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce696a3541e86461bf1844deff5c6b91","title":"its curtains for theatre but not let us hope for too long","story":"This is the art form that makes us feel most acutely human. We are going to need it more than everBoris Johnson in his Tuesday press conference compared the task of confronting Covid-19 to a war effort. But, when it comes to the theatre, comparisons with the second world war quickly break down. On 3 September 1939, all theatres closed upon the declaration of war. Within two weeks, however, there was renewed activity. The first theatre to reopen, from noon until six, was the Windmill, which offered the consolation of nonstop variety and stationary nudes. The Old Vic decamped to the London suburbs with an ambitious blend of Shakespeare, Shaw and Goldsmith. By February 1940 Donald Wolfit was presenting hour-long lunchtime versions of Hamlet, Othello, Twelfth Night and other Shakespeare plays, which drew huge audiences and made him a national hero.None of that is possible today, where theatres are heeding the advice against the danger of large assemblies. But even in these straitened times, I’m impressed by inidual initiatives. Papatango Theatre Company, a new writing group, has announced it is commissioning 10 five-minute monologues (actors and playwrights to be paid £100 each) that will be shown online for free. Theatres are also pragmatically asking people who have already bought tickets to treat their money as a donation.They are even planning for the future. I am told that the Old Vic, confronted by the postponement of its sold-out production of 4000 Miles, starring Timothee Chalamet and Eileen Atkins, is planning to stage it in the autumn – and that the Chichester Festival theatre has similar hopes of bringing its aborted productions of Brecht’s The Life of Galileo and Stoppard’s The Real Thing back during the summer.For the moment, however, we are confronted by a total shutdown of live theatre. You could argue that for those who never go anyway it won’t make a huge difference. But, aside from its disastrous impact on personal pay-packets and theatre bank-balances, I suspect it will have unforeseen consequences. Theatre is a place of entertainment and, in the capital especially, a magnet for tourists. But it is also a forum for debate and discussion and, at best, a means of rearranging consciousness.One of the British theatre’s many virtues is its ability to tackle the big issues. That can take many forms. It may consist of a willingness to confront racism, as in Helen Edmundson’s remarkable adaptation of Andrea Levy’s Small Island or John Kani’s vision of post-apartheid South Africa in Kunene and the King. It may consist of an examination of political history – as in National Theatre of Scotland’s bracing revival of John McGrath’s The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black, Black Oil. Or it may consist of a study of inidual depression, as in a striking adaptation of Matt Haig’s Reasons To Stay Alive, which I saw last year in Sheffield.Theatre can do many things. At its best it offers entertainment, enlightenment and ecstasy. And, while I may be prejudiced, I think theatre is far better placed than other media to point the way society should be going: look, for instance, at the way it has far outstripped television and film when it comes to race and gender-neutral casting.Theatre is also, above all, a social medium. I am constantly struck by the way, especially in somewhat lifeless urban centres, a theatre is often a beacon of communal activity.Since I gave up my post as the ’s chief theatre critic in December, I am often asked what I miss. Luckily, since I am contracted to write regular columns both for this paper and Country Life, I’ve still been going to the theatre twice a week. But what I miss most about not being a regular critic is the social aspect. By that I mean the chance to constantly discuss, debate and argue about plays with friends, colleagues or total strangers. With the shutdown, I’m also finding that a whole series of meetings with students and theatre parties have been scrapped.All this may be a small price to pay for avoiding contamination by the coronavirus. But, while I fully understand the need to save lives and guard the nation’s health, the absence of theatre for the foreseeable future is a huge loss. Theatre can be a way of making us feel more like a member of the human race, and I pray for its speedy restoration.• Michael Billington has written about theatre for the  since 1971"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16b93185d4f6b7201f1bcf27eef8ed52853ef3ec/0_272_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713f05830e1f64ddee8f1c19b1be429b","title":"myth blitz spirit model coronavirus","story":"Wartime leaders disguised the awful reality of being bombed with tales of British resolve. It’s no fit approach for this crisisWhenever there is a crisis in Britain, we are treated to invocations of the “blitz spirit”. The term has had a long shelf-life. After the London bombings in 2005, even journalists abroad claimed to see the spirit at play among the gritty Londoners who chose to walk miles to work rather than stay panic-stricken at home. Few slogans from the second world war have flourished so much in the 75 years since its end, save perhaps for “Keep calm and carry on”, a poster that was never in fact released for public display during the war, but one that captures what is now understood to lie at the core of Britain’s wartime stoicism.What the term means has never been accurately defined, then or now. It suggests resilience in the face of unexpected adversity, sustaining a common bond between citizens facing a shared threat and remaining calm or cheerful despite calamity. All of these were sentiments the authorities hoped would define the popular British reaction to enemy bombings during the second world war, just as they will no doubt be cited again as British society wrestles with the challenges of the virus.The “blitz spirit” was nevertheless an invention at the time. There was doubtless evidence of stoic behaviour during the second world war. Psychiatrists at the time worried that there would be an epidemic of “air-raid phobia” and hospitals prepared for an influx of psychiatric casualties, but there were fewer admissions to psychiatric hospitals in 1940 than in 1939. One leading psychoanalyst, Edward Glover, published a Penguin Special in 1940 on how to conquer fear. His recipe was a simple pat on the shoulder and some firm words. He suggested carrying a packet of sweets or some biscuits, or a flask of brandy, to cheer up those unnerved by the bombs.These banal solutions masked the reality of being bombed night after night. In the heavily bombed cities – Plymouth, Southampton, Clydebank – tens of thousands of people trekked out of the city into the countryside or neighbouring villages for shelter and food. Their understandable reaction was fear. Endurance was unavoidable, and survival their chief priority. Exhibiting the “blitz spirit” was not. Government researchers found that what people wanted most was sound information, the promise of welfare and rehabilitation, and somewhere to sleep. The sight of destroyed buildings, corpses and body parts was utterly alien to daily life. The trauma this produced was largely unrecorded, and certainly untreated.The one exception was the city of Hull, where the government sent a team of psychiatrists and psychologists to study why the populations apparently panicked after heavy raiding. The subsequent report, The Mental Stability of Hull, was based on interviews with hundreds of survivors. These case studies showed that people developed serious psychosomatic conditions, including involuntary soiling and wetting, persistent crying, uncontrollable shaking, headaches and chronic dizziness men were found to indulge in heavy drinking and smoking after a raid, and prone to developing peptic ulcers. One woman was bombed out of three different houses, and watched the death of her sister and her five children. Her symptoms indicated an exceptional level of nervous collapse.Nevertheless, the conclusion from Hull was that its mental stability was nothing to worry about. The government papered over the evidence of the physical and psychological effects of being bombed and focused instead on the stories of British resolve. The propaganda film London Can Take It! reinforced the view that British people were not to be terrorised into submission. The famous photograph of a milkman picking his way through the ruins to deliver the milk was widely distributed, but it was a fake – the milkman was in fact the photographer’s assistant, wearing a white coat. The public face of the “blitz spirit” concealed the awful reality of being bombed.The British people have never been subjected again to anything like the blitz, or the V-weapon campaign later in the war. Over the years, trauma subsided. Yet the history of the blitz is remembered in the terms the authorities had originally wanted. “Blitz spirit” is an instantly recognisable commodity today, but it has become orced from historic reality. Perhaps it serves a useful function in the current crisis in stemming panic and encouraging collaborative action to minimise the danger. Perhaps the prime minister sees himself in Winston Churchill’s shoes, combating this time germs rather than Germans. But perhaps not, as the empty supermarket shelves have shown, and as the government stumbles from one set of directives to another. The blitz is part of a bitter, violent past, not an appropriate metaphor for the problems of the 21st century. Now more than ever, we should reflect upon the true history of the blitz spirit – and lay its sentiment to rest.• Richard Overy is professor of history at the University of Exeter and author of The Bombing War"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d34004c7dd654784babe33d02ed3338c5351057/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a0ab61e5d0b03a7d7c5d84f4e090a50","title":"the end of joie de vivre france gets serious on coronavirus","story":"After initially ignoring the national lockdown, people are now heeding the president’s guidance If a week is a long time in politics, it’s an eternity for governments dealing with coronavirus. The pandemic threatens to wreak havoc on health services and bring the global economy to a standstill. Though France has not reached the critical stage of its Italian neighbour, where permits are required to leave your house, it is inching closer towards quarantine.Less than a week ago, President Emmanuel Macron announced that schools and universities would be closed. Two days later, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, hastily took to the political stage to order that cafes, bars, cinemas and theatres be shut down by midnight that day. It was a Saturday evening, and the theatres and restaurants of Paris were full. On social media, people posted videos of relaxed customers enjoying a last drink in bars long after the curfew had commenced. Policemen surveyed the scene as bystanders. They did not dare to interrupt this ordinary show of French joie de vivre.The following day, still undeterred by the government’s warnings, crowds were spotted in outdoor markets and parks across the country. Macron and Philippe were reportedly appalled by the population’s lack of collective discipline. The French media reported that one of Macron’s political advisers quoted Philippe Pétain’s infamous 1940 speech: “The spirit of enjoyment has overpowered the spirit of sacrifice.” Pétain, who served as the chief of state of Vichy France in collaboration with Nazi Germany, believed that France’s abject military defeat in the summer of 1940 could only be explained by the population’s lack of seriousness, poor work ethic and innate penchant for entertainment. Pétain singled out the leftwing Popular Front alliance, which granted workers their first ever paid holiday, as responsible for the country’s military and moral collapse.After people showed little sign of heeding Macron’s guidance, the president implemented further restrictive measures. During a speech on Monday, which invoked a mixture of Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, Macron insisted several times that the country was “at war”, and asked the French to stay at home and self-isolate for two weeks.Macron has become known for cutting public spending, so his pledges to fully fund the French national health service, “whatever the costs”, came as a surprise. Most surprising of all, however, was his announcement to freeze controversial pension reforms that ignited a months-long nationwide strike earlier this year. What the political left, the French unions and the gilets jaunes could not achieve after a year of intense political backlash, coronavirus has done in just a few days.This is the closest France has come so far to an Italian-style lockdown. In theory, all French citizens are confined at home and should work from there. Everyone has to download an attestation de déplacement dérogatoire (an exceptional travel certificate). You are not required to show proof that you have a right to be out on the street people self-certify and sign the “declaration of honour”. The government is hoping that people will follow the rules.But the first day of the national lockdown did not go according to plan. In some big cities (notably Paris), large crowds could be seen wandering in the streets. Shoppers bustled through the streets few wore masks or kept the one-metre distance. The police began issuing on-the-spot fines to citizens who weren’t carrying travel certificates. Didier Lallement, the police chief of Paris who has presided over a dramatic increase in alleged cases of police brutality, threatened to use more “expedient” measures to force people to obey orders.The situation has dramatically worsened this week. On Monday, 1,200 new cases were detected in one day, bringing the total number of reported cases to 6,633. At the time of writing, there are now 7,730 diagnosed cases and 175 have died after having contracted the virus. Stronger measures should probably have been taken earlier. Macron has acted decisively – but not consistently. Just a week ago, he invited the French to carry on life as usual, while on the same weekend that Macron closed bars and cinemas, the French executive flip-flopped on whether to hold local elections (they have since been postponed). Instead of giving orders once the virus had already begun to spread, Macron would perhaps have been well advised to sketch out how, in a time of coronavirus, a new French resistance could help contain the outbreak.• Philippe Marlière is professor of French and European politics at University College, London• This article has been amended to correct Emmanuel Macron’s announcement on pension reforms: they will be frozen, not reversed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8823ebbba5f2fdb11d89318002f87f94127cc022/0_98_3731_2238/master/3731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca2aca68d078cc1023b278dadd6c509b","title":"underlying conditions coronavirus health","story":"The UK government’s treatment of the coronavirus outbreak has in effect written off all of us with health issues“They’ve had a coronavirus death at the local hospital – but they had underlying health conditions,” the Facebook thread ran, with group members piling in to offer a collective “phew”. It was hard to ignore the underlying sentiment being expressed: that those with underlying health conditions were going to die anyway, so what did it matter if Covid-19 took them now?But here’s the thing – that death that doesn’t matter, it could be me. It could be your school pal. Your workmate. Your neighbour. We’ve all been merrily going about business as usual for years – you’d pass us in the street without noticing that we’re living with an ongoing health condition. And now we’re all being made to feel our lives don’t matter.Where does this attitude come from? Ever since the first report of a coronavirus fatality in England, the government has been trying to calm nerves by stressing the victims’ poor health. The statement by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announcing the death ran to four sentences, the third of which read: “The patient, who was being treated at the Royal Berkshire hospital, was an older patient who had underlying health conditions.”Last week Boris Johnson blithely pronounced: “I must level with you, the British public. Many more families are going to lose their loved ones before their time.” I’m 53 – how much before my time is that?The language used by officials describing the spiralling scenarios risks dehumanising us, and makes us feel we no longer matter. To take just one example: Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, went on Newsnight last week and didn’t blink as he nonchalantly talked about those with “pre-existing conditions” who will have “more serious illness and unfortunately death”.Until Monday’s U-turn, the UK government’s policy was to manage rather than to contain the virus - which would have allowed close to a quarter of a million people to die. Allowing Covid-19 to spread throughout the population in the hope of building some “herd immunity” among the youngest, fittest and healthiest felt irresponsible at best, and callous at worst. When an esteemed epidemiologist thinks the government’s plan is satire, then we must question what’s going on. As William Hanage so succinctly put it: “We talk about vaccines generating herd immunity, so why is this different? Because this is not a vaccine. This is an actual pandemic that will make a very large number of people sick, and some of them will die.” Although plans have now changed, Boris Johnson’s new announcement doesn’t go far enough. He needs to take a leaf out of Emmanuel Macron’s book and launch a war against the virus, rather than surrendering lives prematurely.Rehearsing with my amateur dramatics group last week, I looked around and noted with a jolt that practically everyone there had an underlying condition, be it asthma, diabetes, living in respite from cancer, or living with an organ transplant. We are not sick people day to day. We are highly functioning iniduals – contributing fully to the economy and also playing important roles in our community, as carers for children or parents. We are not ready to die.I’ve just got off the telephone from speaking to one of my oldest friends, an NHS anaesthetist who is about to embark on specialist training to intubate coronavirus patients. “Kathryn,” she said, “You must not take any risks. We need you to get through this.” At last, someone values my life. If only my government and the rest of society could see me and my “underlying health issues” peers the same way. We matter. Everyone should matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587cd58783794ce520fc729ff7e604c83f3562a4/63_52_1613_968/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7872702e318abdab904e6489780df11","title":"tip of the iceberg is our destruction of nature responsible for covid 19 aoe","story":"As habitat and bioersity loss increase globally, the coronavirus outbreak may be just the beginning of mass pandemicsMayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly spilled out of the forest in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.I travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from bioersity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.Villagers told me how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died.Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.But a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of bioersity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, recently wrote in the New York Times. “We cut the trees we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”Research suggests that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are crossing from animals to humans, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals.Some, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as Marburg, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is linked to camels in the Middle East, are new to humans and spreading globally.Other diseases that have crossed into humans include Lassa fever, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria Nipah from Malaysia and Sars from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like Zika and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and become established on other continents.Kate Jones, chair of ecology and bioersity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”.Increasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”Jones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. “We have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,” he says.“Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s  department of  environmental  sciences, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.“I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. “The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.”Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals – in which the virus is naturally circulating – and themselves. “We fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza we can expect large-scale human mortalities we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” Gillespie says.Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.”Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease. “Altering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme bacteria,” he says.Yet human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.“There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,” he says.Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode bioersity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit new diseases to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for existing diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.The “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell numerous wild animals, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.Equally, urban markets in west and central Africa sell monkeys, bats, rats, and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage.“Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”The Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been shut by the Chinese authorities, and last month Beijing outlawed the trading and eating of wild animals except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.“The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,” says Jones.“These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene.Fevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), argue in a blog post that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.“It is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease is not always so clear cut.”So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she adds.“The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.“We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start with one or two people. The solutions start with education and awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,” he says. “They want to know what to do. They want to learn.”Fevre and Tacoli advocate rethinking urban infrastructure, particularly within low-income and informal settlements. “Short-term efforts are focused on containing the spread of infection,” they write. “The longer term – given that new infectious diseases will likely continue to spread rapidly into and within cities – calls for an overhaul of current approaches to urban planning and development.”The bottom line, Bird says, is to be prepared. “We can’t predict where the next pandemic will come from, so we need mitigation plans to take into account the worst possible scenarios,” he says. “The only certain thing is that the next one will certainly come.”• This piece is jointly published with Ensia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bb10647abfc3c3790468d409377ce681b788a08/0_20_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8d9044d8a7ea3114e600929f799f308","title":"win for conservation as african black rhino numbers rise","story":"Slow recovery due to relocating groups and stronger protection through law enforcementNumbers of African black rhinos in the wild have risen by several hundred, a rare boost in the conservation of a species driven to near extinction by poaching.The painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some iniduals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species’ range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.“The continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,” said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat.The outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday.White rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa’s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more attractive to poachers, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats.Poaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching.“With the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,” said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. “If the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.”The impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. “The impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,” said Emslie. “Those in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.”Thursday’s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction. The red list is likely to be updated at least three more times this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/222cabcb20bb8a4e2f7edaf9bdfbbeb5401099b3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51d24060663939bcb5a7784387d68957","title":"10 best high street earrings and bags in pictures","story":"Invest in accessories with a natural edge.

Aren’t we?You might think, in a time of global panic like this one, the movements and behaviours of the rich and the famous are rendered dizzyingly irrelevant, candy floss-light non-news designed to distract us from The Great Looming Bug. You’d be right. In many ways, the face of fame is destined to change after all this has blown over: many people we consider famous now, at the start of all this, will no longer be famous when it is done. This is because the machinery that makes them famous – the movies, the reality shows, the album productions, the photoshoots – will cease production for months, and the great unseen currency in which the famous trade – relevance – will fade alongside it. Like, do we really need “Florence Pugh” as much as we’ve been pretending we do this last year? Coronavirus will be that acid test.But even when the concept of celebrity ceases being a social function – you can’t be famous in the wastelands, can you? You can’t “I have 5.5 million Instagram followers” your way out of a feral gang beheading – I ask you this: knowing you live on a planet where Jared Leto is out there, existing … do you not think you will be fundamentally curious as to what he is up to? Just to keep track of his movements to ensure he doesn’t tiptoe too close to you, if anything. You want to know what Jared Leto is up to. As long as Jared Leto exists, we simply must know what he is up to. This is the true nature of fame. Leto is a creature so distant, so baffling, we simply must gaze at him in wonder. In any other timeline – alternate universes shoot off into the infinite where this is broadly true – we would keep him in a bulletproof tank inside a zoo, and pay tickets to go and look at him. Anyway Jared Leto news now, andLeto somehow managed to miss the coronavirus news (if you have also somehow missed it, may I gesture at the broad sense of eerie silence loaded with the potential of chaos that surrounds you right now, and maybe suggest you get the  app and turn push notifications “on”), and he managed to do so in the most Jared Leto way possible: by being on a silent meditation retreat in the desert. No joke can I write, following that. No point trying. Leto has out-Leto’d Leto. There is no cherry to put atop that sundae. He missed the coronavirus news because he was “thinking”.“Wow,” Leto tweeted this week. “12 days ago I began a silent meditation in the desert. We were totally isolated. No phone, no communication etc. We had no idea what was happening outside the facility.” He added: “Walked out yesterday into a very different world. One that’s been changed for ever. Mind blowing – to say the least. I’m getting messages from friends and family all around the globe and catching up on what’s going on.” And then – in one of the most astounding “famous people” moves I think we’ve seen in 2020 – Leto, a man who may I remind you learned about coronavirus about 15 minutes ago and is still getting days-old text messages coming through that just say “bro did u die????” – tweeted some bland coronavirus advice, saying: “Hope you and yours are ok. Sending positive energy to all. Stay inside. Stay safe.” Mate, I’ve been staying inside, because I’ve known about coronavirus! Don’t you dare step out of the desert after not talking for 12 days and tell me what to do! I’ve been fascinated by Leto for a long time, because everything he does is shrouded in this inescapable, granular Leto-ness, possibly more than any other celebrity alive. The best Leto story – before “somehow missing coronavirus because he was so lost in his own thoughts” – was the filming of Chapter 27, where he spent two months packing on 67lb (almost five stone) to play John Lennon’s killer, Mark Chapman, a feat he managed by guzzling microwaved pints of ice cream mixed with olive oil and soy sauce. He put on so much weight for the role that he developed gout and struggled to walk to set every day. Such dedication to a part, you would think, might garner an Oscar nod, or a blockbuster opening weekend, but no: the film opened to generally poor reviews and ultimately grossed less than $200k. The lesson we must learn from this is: if you’re going to put on so much weight for a role that you Henry VIII yourself, it’s broadly advisable to do it for a decent script. It’s arguable that Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s did better out of that film than the distributor did. Maybe that’s what he was thinking about in the desert. I know I’d never stop thinking about that, even for one quiet second of my life.What we need in this time is sources of simple joy, and while some celebrities have stepped up to the plate – I’m looking at you, Robbie Williams, who this week hosted an Instagram Live from his hotel room, resplendently topless, laptop steaming on his duvet, playing his own songs from YouTube, advert pre-roll and all, singing along to them direct to camera, giving his fans an utterly bonkers intimate dream concert because he was isolated from his wife and children, and if his knighthood isn’t assured by that alone then I suggest we storm the castle – some very much have not, and yes obviously I am talking about Gal Gadot.On Instagram, Gadot – along with a number of other self-isolating celebrities, including Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig, Jamie Dornan, Sia, Zoe Kravitz, Natalie Portman, Amy Adams, Mark Ruffalo, Norah Jones, Jimmy Fallon and Cara Delevingne – uploaded a video of them all singing snippets of John Lennon’s Imagine. There they are, in various gardens and against various blank mansion walls, and in various of those special calamitously bad outfits celebrities wear in the downtime moments when they are not being styled, and we realise how fundamentally useless they all are without help, that they can’t even get dressed properly, and that, truly, a lot of them really are lucky that they’re hot. “We are in this together, we will get through it together,” Gadot wrote. “Let’s imagine together. Sing with us.” I have to preface this statement with: it’s very nice that they all tried. The sentiment behind it is sincere. But the video itself is the worst thing I’ve ever seen on the internet, and I’ve seen corpses on this thing.Firstly: why do celebrities think them singing a song, badly, is helpful?

It’s all well and good for famous people to stay at home where they have a room “just for clothes” and a swimming pool in their garden, but slightly trickier for the rest of us, worrying about income, grocery levels, having to weapon up to go to Aldi, and whether that ominous cough our housemate seems to have got will somehow, distantly, kill our nan.

So it is with J Balvin’s sixth solo album: whatever you make of Guess’s attendant Colores capsule collection (it’s as subtle and understated as you might expect from clothes designed by a singer who expressed his solidarity with 2019’s Pride events by dying his hair rainbow colours) its existence tells you a lot about the enviable commercial position the 34-year-old Colombian currently finds himself in.If he isn’t so well-known in the UK – where 2017’s platinum-selling Mi Gente remains his only major hit – that’s not a situation reflected elsewhere. Luis Fonsi’s Despacito might have been the song that signalled Latin pop’s ascension to the upper echelons of success outside of Spanish-speaking countries, but it’s Balvin who embodies the genre. He was the first Latino artist to headline Lollapalooza, the first reggaeton artist to appear on Saturday Night Live, and the only guest star at Beyoncé’s epic 2018 Coachella performance who wasn’t a former bandmate or member of her immediate family. That year, he was also the fourth most-streamed artist globally on Spotify.For further evidence of his hugeness, you only have to look at the cover for Colores, which is hideous – a cutesy cartoon of multicoloured grinning flowers – but the kind of hideous that costs a fortune: it’s the work of Takashi Murakami, the Japanese contemporary artist who once sold a sculpture of an anime teenager masturbating for $15.2m. Or read the list of starry cameo appearances, which won’t take long: there aren’t any. It’s often suggested that Latin pop’s commercial rise is a result of both the global village effect of the internet and the canny use of guest stars to prick the interest of anglophone audiences. Balvin evidently no longer needs the latter, and there’s something understandably confident about Colores, from its grand concept album status (every song is named after a colour, although the lyrics seem conceptual only in so far as they largely revolve around how sexually irresistible Balvin is) to its brevity. Ten songs, over in 29 minutes: no need for a Drake-like attempt to game the streaming systems by sticking out an album with dozens of tracks on it.For anyone who’s missed the finer points of Balvin’s rise, it provides a concentrated primer. He is widely held to have leapfrogged his urbano music rivals by smoothing out the sound of reggaeton: dialling down the aggression in the vocal delivery to a nonchalant drawl, favouring singing over rapping, being unashamedly tuneful. There are points where Colores delivers something approaching visceral thrills – such as on the gloomy, minimal Negro, when the roughness of the beats chafe against the lush melodicism of Morado – but Balvin’s ability to break cultural boundaries isn’t matched by a desire to smash artistic ones. There’s little of the off-kilter weirdness or the sudden, mid-song stylistic shifts associated with his competitor and sometime collaborator Bad Bunny. Colores is an album of clever production touches – the appealing balafon samples that open Verde the hazy, shoegazey electronic tones that Diplo weaves around Rosado – rather than head-spinning sonic WTF-ery, the musical equivalent of the blood-soaked visuals in the video for recent single Rojo. The closest it gets to the latter might be sparse opener Amarillo, where the only music in the arrangement is provided by what seem to be people making trumpet noises with their mouths.It isn’t really interested in standing out by startling the listener, or reeling them in with novelty, but what Colores does have in profusion is a universal brand of pop smarts. There are a plethora of choruses that dig into your brain and breezy but beautifully turned tunes: one listen and Azul is almost impossible to dislodge even single Blanco, which dispenses with everything except beats, bassline and Balvin’s voice, is infernally catchy. It makes sense that every track comes with a lavish video attached, and not merely because that’s another way of demonstrating his current status. It is focused in a way that a longer album wouldn’t be, and every track sounds like a potential single.It would be nice if the kind of artistic risk-taking Balvin demonstrates in his videos was reflected more in the music, but under the circumstances, you can’t blame him for sounding pleased with himself. “‘Tamo’ rompiendo o no estamos rompiendo, muchachos?” he asks at the conclusion of Morado (“Are we smashing it or are we not smashing it, guys?) before allowing himself a delighted chuckle and adding the word “global”, which hardly needs translating. Nothing on Colores suggests that the appeal is going to narrow in the foreseeable future.Daði og Gagnamagnið: Think About ThingsRobbed of wider exposure by Covid-19, Iceland’s 2020 Eurovision entry is a thing of keytar-playing choreographed wonder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc7e7d263ca051b5160cdd40d7b18542beb1f0ee/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=370b94a2d0df04059aa952f8a9186108","title":"is the government moving fast enough on coronavirus","story":"Britain has not joined its European neighbours by shutting schools, closing borders or rolling out mass testing.

It provides no reason to keep staff employed. In fact the reverse, because the smaller the wage bill, the less would have to be borrowed,” he said.Brown said Sunak must do “considerably more” by the weekend to protect people’s jobs. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “He says he’ll do more but the package should be out now to avoid redundancies being forced upon companies over the next day or two.Sunak announced an expansion of statutory sick pay in the budget on 11 March and a relaxation of benefit rules designed to help vulnerable workers. He has not ruled out adopting a broader package of income support but has said the mechanisms used by other European countries do not exist in the UK.As part of the package announced on Tuesday, the chancellor offered businesses in the hard-hit retail, leisure and hospitality sectors a year-long holiday from paying business rates, with smaller firms also eligible for a cash grant of up to £25,000.Sunak also announced cash grants of £10,000 for the UK’s 700,000 smallest companies and a three-month moratorium on mortgage payments for homeowners in difficulty due to the coronavirus.With the scale of the coronavirus pandemic – and the public health response to it – having escalated since the budget last week, the Resolution Foundation said the chancellor must “step up the scale of support for affected workers and rethink the approach to helping struggling firms”.The thinktank’s report says around 5 million workers are vulnerable to being laid off unless the government goes further. Without giving a forecast for the likely rise in unemployment, the report estimates in its modelling of the potential costs that between 500,000 and 1 million workers could be laid off.The report says a fresh approach is needed, including the extension of sick pay to 2 million low earners currently excluded and an increase in unemployment benefits and universal credit to £100 per week. It says a rise in unemployment is inevitable as some firms go bust and the self-employed lose work.“To strengthen the safety net that many families will rely on in the months ahead, the government should increase the generosity of jobseeker’s allowance, employment support allowance and the standard rate of universal credit. From April these benefits will pay just £74 a week to a single adult – and just £59 to those under 25) – when losing their jobs,” the report says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0498e54d14ccaba3d8e52bbc0a48e2fee9d447a8/0_106_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33cde71aabc61586b018a1ebc5678b7f","title":"older people widely demonised uk ageism report","story":"Older members of society mostly seen as incompetent, hostile or a burden, says reportThe UK’s ageist attitudes have been revealed in a report that shows older people are widely mocked, patronised and demonised by the rest of society.Older people are mostly seen as incompetent, hostile or a burden on others, according to a review of the evidence that found they are subject to a litany of damaging stereotypes.Negative attitudes are rife in the workplace, in health and social care and in the media, with women and people from black and minority ethnic groups facing a “double jeopardy” of discrimination, the paper by the Centre for Ageing Better revealed.The report – titled Doddery But Dear? – reviewed all existing research on attitudes to ageing. It found that older workers are seen as having lower levels of performance, less ability to learn and being more costly than younger workers.In health and social care, the review found that stereotypes are even more negative, with attitudes focusing on death and physical decline, and ageing seen as a process of increasing ill health.The media is a key driver of negative attitudes, the study says, representing ageing as a crisis or a societal burden, with the ageing population described using metaphors such as “grey tsunami”, “demographic cliff” and “demographic timebomb”. Often, older people are depicted as “villains” unfairly consuming too many of society’s resources.Anna Dixon, the group’s chief executive, said: “Ageism, like any other form of prejudice, has a profound effect on our self-esteem, our wellbeing and the way we experience day-to-day life. The responses to the Covid-19 crisis have thrown up serious questions about the way we think and talk about older people, and highlighted what an impact those attitudes can have.“Our new research shows that in spite of the progress we’ve made towards challenging discrimination in Britain, we still have an ingrained culture of pity, dislike and disassociation towards older people.”Other research shows that ageism has broad and far-reaching negative consequences. It can have a negative impact on physical and mental health and it can influence whether older patients receive treatment, as well as the duration, frequency and appropriateness of that treatment.“Most of us are living many years longer than previous generations and this is a gift to be celebrated. But the outdated and harmful attitudes laid bare in this research are preventing too many people from making the most of those extra years,” said Dixon.“Ageism is deeply damaging, and yet all too often it isn’t taken as seriously as other forms of prejudice or discrimination. Britain is long overdue a fundamental culture shift to overturn these attitudes, and the media needs to reflect the erse experiences of people in later life.”Deborah Alsina, the chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: “Classing people in later life as a ‘burden’ is the ultimate insult and is particularly concerning in the current climate. The whole of our society needs to pull together, but these findings show that we are not always treating each other fairly. We must all work to ensure these ageist stereotypes are removed from our public discourse altogether, now and in the future.“There needs to be a cultural shift in our attitudes towards older people. After all, with any luck we will all get there one day.”David Sinclair, the director of the International Longevity Centre, said: “The negative impact of ageism hits all ages. It results in people being forced out of work early and losing access to vital services.“Ageism is far too prevalent across society. Tackling ageism means tackling patronising attitudes to older people. Ageism fundamentally undermines older people’s participation in society and can contribute to greater isolation and loneliness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca881ffed03c04deb5b2359a464f6dfcade6fa07/0_67_3174_1904/master/3174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73070ef2ee1fdac07bf3a90a56d65b9e","title":"dee caffari tips for self isolation coronavirus sailor","story":"Dee Caffari has been alone at sea for as long as six months.

In transcripts obtained by the BBC, Farah denies having been given the injection in the initial 2015 interview with Usada.Panorama reported he then met the UK Athletics head of distance running, Barry Fudge, immediately after the interview and returned to the room as the investigators were preparing to leave. At this point, Farah, who won 5,000 metres and 10,000m gold at the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, told them he had been given the injection.In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Farah explains: “I was questioned for five hours. I said one thing and then other things got said and now it’s made out like I’ve done wrong, but if you know how it happened then it’s easier to understand. When I came out I said to Barry, ‘Hey mate, they kept asking me about this supplement. What’s that?’“He said, ‘Yeah, it’s this, you did take it’, so I went straight back in and told them. I forgot, but as soon as I was told I ran back in. If I was a liar, why would I go straight back in? I said, ‘Look, I genuinely forgot, I didn’t know that. Now I do.’”“I can sleep at night knowing I’ve done nothing wrong. I love representing my country, making my country proud and doing what I do best because it is a gift and that’s why I do it with a smile. But it’s not fair what comes with it. It’s not fair on my kids and my family. It’s just not right. It’s depressing. Mentally and physically it’s had an effect on me.”Excerpts from a legal letter from Farah’s lawyers to the BBC, which have been seen by the PA news agency, read: “Mr Farah understood the question one way and as soon as he left the room he asked Mr Fudge and immediately returned … to clarify and it is plain the investigators were comfortable with this explanation.Farah finished eighth in the 2014 London Marathon and the fact he had been given L-carnitine was first reported by the Sunday Times three years later. L-carnitine is a naturally occurring amino acid that some studies suggest could boost athletic performance if it is injected directly into the bloodstream.L-carnitine is not a prohibited substance under Wada rules. Injections and infusions of it were permitted within Wada rules in 2014 provided the volume was below 50 millilitres every six hours. The permitted volume is now 100ml every 12 hours.Salazar, Farah’s former coach at the Nike Oregon Project, was handed a four-year ban by Usada in October last year for doping violations, though he has appealed to the court of arbitration for sport.Farah, who ended his relationship with the American in 2017, has never failed a drugs test and is not accused of any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b13a4b2ed084a20d2e9053361cf688b49c4c438/0_187_5130_3077/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c45e67074554912bfef6659d2b236e2","title":"tokyo olympics delayed coronavirus sebastian coe","story":"Sebastian Coe has admitted that “nobody is saying we will be going to the Games come what may” as the debate over whether the Tokyo Olympics should be staged this summer continues to intensify.A growing number of athletes and athlete representatives, including Britain’s world heptathlon champion, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, and the Olympic pole vault gold medallist, Katerina Stefanidi of Greece, have expressed their concerns about being able to prepare for the Games with much of Europe in lockdown. The president of World Athletics has now accepted that nothing is off the table in terms of future planning – including moving the Games to September or October – because of the coronavirus pandemic.“That is possible, anything is possible at the moment,” said Lord Coe, who was also in charge of the London 2012 Olympics. “I think the position that sport has taken, and it was certainly the temperature of the room in the conversation I had the other day with the IOC and our other federations, is that nobody is saying we will be going to the Games come what may.”Nevertheless, Coe does not believe a decision has to be taken yet. “It may be that over the course of changing events, and they’re changing by the hour, that that is something we have to confront,” he said. “But it isn’t a decision that has to be made at this moment.”“The European football championships have moved to next year, that too would clash. The sporting calendar is a very complicated matrix, it’s notthat simple to just simply say we’ll ease one event from one year to the next. We have done that with our own world indoor championships but that doesn’t clash with anything else at the same time.”As for the prospect of combining the Olympics and the world championships next year, Coe told Radio 4’s Today programme: “It would be ridiculous of me to say anything is ruled out at the moment. We are living in an environment where everything is changing very quickly, the whole world wants clarity, that’s just simply not possible at the moment and we’re no different from any other sector.”Meanwhile the four-times Olympic champion Sir Matthew Pinsent has increased his criticism of the IOC, saying it would be “folly” to allow the Olympics to go ahead. “I think it’s the IOC saying we must try and get through if we can, which I have a degree of sympathy with, it just runs counter to what every health authority and government is saying around the world,” Pinsent told the Today programme.“On a global front we have other priorities and I think the Olympics should at the very least be saying we should postpone or indeed just cancel at this stage and we’ll talk about postponement later on. I just don’t think there’s much of a choice at this stage. For much of the European countries as well as Asian countries, organised sport in any meaningful way has ceased and that’s from government advice. I don’t see there’s any way forward for an Olympic athlete to train effectively even as an inidual but particularly in a team environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8de71b9ea8e316621e768e022bdc3fca4f0bd80/205_474_5067_3041/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591267d37ed03b52b5e92c928dfd288d","title":"iditarod 2020 the worlds most famous sled dog race in pictures","story":"Thomas Waerner of Norway won the nearly 1,000-mile sled dog race in Alaska, of the few sporting events not canceled amid the coronavirus outbreak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/731ca13a6f8a328caaebbaffeadf7f284c82960b/0_280_4421_2653/master/4421.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5349d369b85528db69fc80c302ff25fb","title":"can computers ever replace the classroom","story":"With 850 million children worldwide shut out of schools, tech evangelists claim now is the time for AI education. But as the technology’s power grows, so too do the dangers that come with it. By  Alex BeardFor a child prodigy, learning didn’t always come easily to Derek Haoyang Li. When he was three, his father – a famous educator and author – became so frustrated with his progress in Chinese that he vowed never to teach him again. “He kicked me from here to here,” Li told me, moving his arms wide.Yet when Li began school, aged five, things began to click. Five years later, he was selected as one of only 10 students in his home province of Henan to learn to code. At 16, Li beat 15 million kids to first prize in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad. Among the offers that came in from the country’s elite institutions, he decided on an experimental fast-track degree at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. It would enable him to study maths, while also covering computer science, physics and psychology.In his first year at university, Li was extremely shy. He came up with a personal algorithm for making friends in the canteen, weighing data on group size and conversation topic to optimise the chances of a positive encounter. The method helped him to make friends, so he developed others: how to master English, how to interpret dreams, how to find a girlfriend. While other students spent the long nights studying, Li started to think about how he could apply his algorithmic approach to business. When he graduated at the turn of the millennium, he decided that he would make his fortune in the field he knew best: education.In person, Li, who is now 42, displays none of the awkwardness of his university days. A successful entrepreneur who helped create a billion-dollar tutoring company, Only Education, he is charismatic, and given to making bombastic statements. “Education is one of the industries that Chinese people can do much better than western people,” he told me when we met last year. The reason, he explained, is that “Chinese people are more sophisticated”, because they are raised in a society in which people rarely say what they mean.Li is the founder of Squirrel AI, an education company that offers tutoring delivered in part by humans, but mostly by smart machines, which he says will transform education as we know it. All over the world, entrepreneurs are making similarly extravagant claims about the power of online learning – and more and more money is flowing their way. In Silicon Valley, companies like Knewton and Alt School have attempted to personalise learning via tablet computers. In India, Byju’s, a learning app valued at $6 billion, has secured backing from Facebook and the Chinese internet behemoth Tencent, and now sponsors the country’s cricket team. In Europe, the British company Century Tech has signed a deal to roll out an intelligent teaching and learning platform in 700 Belgian schools, and dozens more across the UK. Their promises are being put to the test by the coronavirus pandemic – with 849 million children worldwide, as of March 2020, shut out of school, we’re in the midst of an unprecedented experiment in the effectiveness of online learning.But it’s in China, where President Xi Jinping has called for the nation to lead the world in AI innovation by 2030, that the fastest progress is being made. In 2018 alone, Li told me, 60 new AI companies entered China’s private education market. Squirrel AI is part of this new generation of education start-ups. The company has already enrolled 2 million student users, opened 2,600 learning centres in 700 cities across China, and raised $150m from investors. The company’s chief AI officer is Tom Mitchell, the former dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, and its payroll also includes a roster of top Chinese talent, including dozens of “super-teachers” – an official designation given to the most expert teachers in the country. In January, during the worst of the outbreak, it partnered with the Shanghai education bureau to provide free products to students throughout the city.Though the most ambitious features have yet to be built into Squirrel AI’s system, the company already claims to have achieved impressive results. At its HQ in Shanghai, I saw footage of downcast human teachers who had been defeated by computers in televised contests to see who could teach a class of students more maths in a single week. Experiments on the effectiveness of different types of teaching videos with test audiences have revealed that students learn more proficiently from a video presented by a good-looking young presenter than from an older expert teacher.When we met, Li rhapsodised about a future in which technology will enable children to learn 10 or even 100 times more than they do today. Wild claims like these, typical of the hyperactive education technology sector, tend to prompt two different reactions. The first is: bullshit – teaching and learning is too complex, too human a craft to be taken over by robots. The second reaction is the one I had when I first met Li in London a year ago: oh no, the robot teachers are coming for education as we know it. There is some truth to both reactions, but the real story of AI education, it turns out, is a whole lot more complicated.At a Squirrel AI learning centre high in an office building in Hangzhou, a city 70 miles west of Shanghai, a cursor jerked tentatively over the words “Modern technology has opened our eyes to many things”. Slouched at a hexagonal table in one of the centre’s dozen or so small classrooms, Huang Zerong, 14, was halfway through a 90-minute English tutoring session. As he worked through activities on his MacBook, a young woman with the kindly manner of an older sister sat next to him, observing his progress. Below, the trees of Xixi National Wetland Park barely stirred in the afternoon heat.A question popped up on Huang’s screen, on which a virtual dashboard showed his current English level, unit score and learning focus – along with the sleek squirrel icon of Squirrel AI.“India is famous for ________ industry.”Huang read through the three possible answers, choosing to ignore “treasure” and “typical” and type “t-e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y” into the box.“T____ is changing fast,” came the next prompt.Huang looked towards the young woman, then he punched out “e-c-h-n-o-l-o-g-y” from memory. She clapped her hands together. “Good!” she said, as another prompt flashed up.Huang had begun his English course, which would last for one term, a few months earlier with a diagnostic test. He had logged into the Squirrel AI platform on his laptop and answered a series of questions designed to evaluate his mastery of more than 10,000 “knowledge points” (such as the distinction between “belong to” and “belong in”). Based on his answers, Squirrel AI’s software had generated a precise “learning map” for him, which would determine which texts he would read, which videos he would see, which tests he would take.As he worked his way through the course – with the occasional support of the human tutor by his side, or one of the hundreds accessible via video link from Squirrel AI’s headquarters in Shanghai – its contents were automatically updated, as the system perceived that Huang had mastered new knowledge.Huang said he was less distracted at the learning centre than he was in school, and felt at home with the technology. “It’s fun,” he told me after class, eyes fixed on his lap. “It’s much easier to concentrate on the system because it’s a device.” His scores in English also seemed to be improving, which is why his mother had just paid the centre a further 91,000 RMB (about £11,000) for another year of sessions: two semesters and two holiday courses in each of four subjects, adding up to around 400 hours in total.“Anyone can learn,” Li explained to me a few days later over dinner in Beijing. You just needed the right environment and the right method, he said.The idea for Squirrel AI had come to him five years earlier. A decade at his tutoring company, Only Education, had left him frustrated. He had found that if you really wanted to improve a student’s progress, by far the best way was to find them a good teacher. But good teachers were rare, and turnover was high, with the best much in demand. Having to find and train 8,000 new teachers each year was limiting the amount students learned – and the growth of his business.The answer, Li decided, was adaptive learning, where an intelligent computer-based system adjusts itself automatically to the best method for an inidual learner. The idea of adaptive learning was not new, but Li was confident that developments in AI research meant that huge advances were now within reach. Rather than seeking to recreate the general intelligence of a human mind, researchers were getting impressive results by putting AI to work on specialised tasks. AI doctors are now equal to or better than humans at analysing X-rays for certain pathologies, while AI lawyers are carrying out legal research that would once have been done by clerks.Following such breakthroughs, Li resolved to augment the efforts of his human teachers with a tireless, perfectly replicable virtual teacher. “Imagine a tutor who knows everything,” he told me, “and who knows everything about you.”In Hangzhou, Huang was struggling with the word “hurry”. On his screen, a video appeared of a neatly groomed young teacher presenting a three-minute masterclass about how to use the word “hurry” and related phrases (“in a hurry” etc). Huang watched along.Moments like these, where a short teaching input results in a small learning output, are known as “nuggets”. Li’s dream, which is the dream of adaptive education in general, is that AI will one day provide the perfect learning experience by ensuring that each of us get just the right chunk of content, delivered in the right way, at the right moment for our inidual needs.One way in which Squirrel AI improves its results is by constantly hoovering up data about its users. During Huang’s lesson, the system continuously tracked and recorded every one of his key strokes, cursor movements, right or wrong answers, texts read and videos watched. This data was time-stamped, to show where Huang had skipped over or lingered on a particular task. Each “nugget” (the video to watch or text to read) was then recommended to him based on an analysis of his data, accrued over hundreds of hours of work on Squirrel’s platform, and the data of 2 million other students. “Computer tutors can collect more teaching experience than a human would ever be able to collect, even in a hundred years of teaching,” Tom Mitchell, Squirrel AI’s chief AI officer, told me over the phone a few weeks later.The speed and accuracy of Squirrel AI’s platform will depend, above all, on the number of student users it manages to sign up. More students equals more data. As each student works their way through a set of knowledge points, they leave a rich trail of information behind them. This data is then used to train the algorithms of the “thinking” part of the Squirrel AI system.This is one reason why Squirrel AI has integrated its online business with bricks-and-mortar learning centres. Most children in China do not have access to laptops and high-speed internet. The learning centres mean the company can reach kids they otherwise would not be able to. One of the reasons Mitchell says he is glad to be working with Squirrel AI is the sheer volume of data that the company is gathering. “We’re going to have millions of natural examples,” he told me with excitement.The dream of a perfect education delivered by machine is not new. For at least a century, generations of visionaries have predicted that the latest inventions will transform learning. “Motion pictures,” wrote the American inventor Thomas Edison in 1922, “are destined to revolutionise our schools.” The immersive power of movies would supposedly turbo-charge the learning process. Others made similar predictions for radio, television, computers and the internet. But despite small successes – the Open University, TV universities in China in the 1980s, or Khan Academy today, which reaches millions of students with its YouTube lessons – teachers have continued to teach, and learners to learn, in much the same way as before.There are two reasons why today’s techno-evangelists are confident that AI can succeed where other technologies failed. First, they view AI not as a simple innovation but as a “general purpose technology” – that is, an epochal invention, like the printing press, which will fundamentally change the way we learn. Second, they believe its powers will shed new light on the working of the human brain – how repetitive practice grows expertise, for instance, or how interleaving (leaving gaps between learning different bits of material) can help us achieve mastery. As a result, we will be able to design adaptive algorithms to optimise the learning process.UCL Institute of Education professor and machine learning expert Rose Luckin believes that one day we might see an AI-enabled “Fitbit for the mind” that would allow us to perceive in real-time what an inidual knows, and how fast they are learning. The device would use sensors to gather data that forms a precise and ever-evolving map of a person’s abilities, which could be cross-referenced with insights into their motivational and nutritional state, say. This information would then be relayed to our minds, in real time, via a computer-brain interface. Facebook is already carrying out research in this field. Other firms are trialling eye tracking and helmets that monitor kids’ brainwaves.The supposed AI education revolution is not here yet, and it is likely that the majority of projects will collapse under the weight of their own hype. IBM’s adaptive tutor Knewton was pulled from US schools under pressure from parents concerned about their kids’ privacy, while Silicon Valley’s Alt School, launched to much fanfare in 2015 by a former Google executive, has burned through $174m of funding without landing on a workable business model. But global school closures owing to coronavirus may yet relax public attitudes to online learning – many online education companies are offering their products for free to all children out of school.Daisy Christodoulou, a London-based education expert, suggests that too much time is spent speculating on what AI might one day do, rather than focusing on what it already can. It’s estimated that there are 900 million young people around the world today who aren’t currently on track to learn what they need to thrive. To help those kids, AI education doesn’t have to be perfect – it just needs to slightly improve on what they currently have.In their book The Future of the Professions, Richard and Daniel Susskind argue that we tend to conceive of occupations as embodied in a person – a butcher or baker, doctor or teacher. As a result, we think of them as ‘too human’ to be taken over by machines. But to an algorithm, or someone designing one, a profession appears as something else: a long list of inidual tasks, many of which may be mechanised. In education, that might be marking or motivating, lecturing or lesson planning. The Susskinds believe that where a machine can do any one of these tasks better and more cheaply than the average human, automation of that bit of the job is inevitable.The point, in short, is that AI doesn’t have to match the general intelligence of humans to be useful – or indeed powerful. This is both the promise of AI, and the danger it poses. “People’s behaviour is already being manipulated,” Luckin cautioned. Devices that might one day enhance our minds are already proving useful in shaping them.In May 2018, a group of students at Hangzhou’s Middle School No 11 returned to their classroom to find three cameras newly installed above the blackboard they would now be under full-time surveillance in their lessons. “Previously when I had classes that I didn’t like very much, I would be lazy and maybe take naps,” a student told the local news, “but I don’t dare be distracted after the cameras were installed.” The head teacher explained that the system could read seven states of emotion on students’ faces: neutral, disgust, surprise, anger, fear, happiness and sadness. If the kids slacked, the teacher was alerted. “It’s like a pair of mystery eyes are constantly watching me,” the student told reporters.The previous year, China’s state council had launched a plan for the role AI could play in the future of the country. Underpinning it were a set of beliefs: that AI can “harmonise” Chinese society that for it to do so, the government should store data on every citizen that companies, not the state, were best positioned to innovate that no company should refuse access to the government to its data. In education, the paper called for new adaptive online learning systems powered by big data, and “all-encompassing ubiquitous intelligent environments” – or smart schools.At AIAED, a conference in Beijing hosted by Squirrel AI, which I attended in May 2019, classroom surveillance was one of the most discussed topics – but the speakers tended to be more concerned about the technical question of how to optimise the effectiveness of facial and bodily monitoring technologies in the classroom, rather than the darker implications of collecting unprecedented amounts of data about children. These ethical questions are becoming increasingly important, with schools from India to the US currently trialling facial monitoring. In the UK, AI is being used today for things like monitoring student wellbeing, automating assessment and even in inspecting schools. Ben Williamson of the Centre for Research in Digital Education explains that this risks encoding biases or errors into the system and raises obvious privacy issues. “Now the school and university might be said to be studying their students too,” he told me.While cameras in the classroom might outrage many parents in the UK or US, Lenora Chu, author of an influential book about the Chinese education system, argues that in China anything that improves a child’s learning tends to be viewed positively by parents. Squirrel AI even offers them the chance to watch footage of their child’s tutoring sessions. “There’s not that idea here that technology is bad,” said Chu, who moved from the US to Shanghai 10 years ago.Rose Luckin suggested to me that a platform like Squirrel AI’s could one day mean an end to China’s notoriously punishing gaokao college entrance exam, which takes place for two days every June and largely determines a student’s education and employment prospects. If technology tracked a student throughout their school days, logging every keystroke, knowledge point and facial twitch, then the perfect record of their abilities on file could make such testing obsolete. Yet a system like this could also furnish the Chinese state – or a US tech company – with an eternal ledger of every step in a child’s development. It is not hard to imagine the grim uses to which this information could be put – for instance, if your behaviour in school was used to judge, or predict, your trustworthiness as an adult.On the one hand, said Chu, the CCP wants to use AI to better prepare young people for the future economy, and to close the achievement gap between rural and urban schools. To this end, companies like Squirrel AI receive government support, such as access to prime office space in top business districts. At the same time, the CCP, as the state council put it, sees AI as “opportunity of the millennium” for “social construction”. That is, social control. The ability of AI to “grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner” through the surveillance of people’s movements, spending and other behaviours means it can play “an irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stability”.The surveillance state is already penetrating deep into people’s lives. In 2019, there was a significant spike in China in the registration of patents for facial recognition and surveillance technology. All new mobile phones in China must now be registered via a facial scan. At the hotels I stayed in, Chinese citizens handed over their ID cards and checked in using face scanners. On the high-speed train to Beijing, the announcer repeatedly warned travellers to abide by the rules in order to maintain their personal credit. The notorious social credit system, which has been under trial in a handful of Chinese cities ahead of an expected nationwide roll out this year, awards or detracts points from an inidual’s trustworthiness score, which affects their ability to travel and borrow money, among other things.The result, explained Chu, is that all these interventions exert a subtle control over what people think and say. “You sense how the wind is blowing,” she told me. For the 12 million Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, however, that control is anything but subtle. Police checkpoints, complete with facial scanners, are ubiquitous. All mobile phones must have Jingwang (“clean net”) app installed, allowing the government to monitor your movements and browsing. Iris and fingerprint scans are required to access health services. As many as 1.5 million Uighurs, including children, have been interned at some point in a re-education camp in the interests of “harmony”.As we shape the use of AI in education, it’s likely that AI will shape us too. Jiang Xueqin, an education researcher from Chengdu, is sceptical that it will be as revolutionary as proponents claim. “Parents are paying for a drug,” he told me over the phone. He thought tutoring companies such as New Oriental, TAL and Squirrel AI were simply preying on parents’ anxieties about their kids’ performance in exams, and only succeeding because test preparation was the easiest element of education to automate – a closed system with limited variables that allowed for optimisation. Jiang wasn’t impressed with the progress made, or the way that it engaged every child in a desperate race to conform to the measures of success imposed by the system.One student I met at the learning centre in Hangzhou, Zhang Hen, seemed to have a deep desire to learn about the world – she told me how she loved Qu Yuan, a Tang dynasty romantic poet, and how she was a fan of Harry Potter – but that wasn’t the reason she was here. Her goal was much simpler: she had come to the centre to boost her test scores. That may seem disappointing to idealists who want education to offer so much more, but Zhang was realistic about the demands of the Chinese education system. She had tough exams that she needed to pass. A scripted system that helped her efficiently master the content of the high school entrance exam was exactly what she wanted.On stage at AIAED, Tom Mitchell had presented a more ambitious vision for adaptive learning that went far beyond helping students cram for mindless tests. Much of what he was most excited by was possible only in theory, but his enthusiasm was palpable. As appealing as his optimism was, though, I felt unconvinced. It was clear that adaptive technologies might improve certain types of learning, but it was equally obvious that they might narrow the aims of education and provide new tools to restrict our freedom.Li insists that one day his system will help all young people to flourish creatively. Though he allows that for now an expert human teacher still holds an edge over a robot, he is confident that AI will soon be good enough to evaluate and reply to students’ oral responses. In less than five years, Li imagines training Squirrel AI’s platform with a list of every conceivable question and every possible response, weighting an algorithm to favour those labelled “creative”. “That thing is very easy to do,” he said, “like tagging cats.”For Li, learning has always been like that – like tagging cats. But there’s a growing consensus that our brains don’t work like computers. Whereas a machine must crunch through millions of images to be able to identify a cat as the collection of “features” that are present only in those images labelled “cat” (two triangular ears, four legs, two eyes, fur, etc), a human child can grasp the concept of “cat” from just a few real life examples, thanks to our innate ability to understand things symbolically. Where machines can’t compute meaning, our minds thrive on it. The adaptive advantage of our brains is that they learn continually through all of our senses by interacting with the environment, our culture and, above all, other people.Li told me that even if AI fulfilled all of its promise, human teachers would still play a crucial role helping kids learn social skills. At Squirrel AI’s HQ, which occupies three floors of a gleaming tower next door to Microsoft and Mobike in Shanghai, I met some of the company’s young teachers. Each sat at a work console in a vast office space, headphones on, eyes focused on a laptop screen, their desks decorated with plastic pot plants and waving cats. As they monitored the dashboards of up to six students simultaneously, the face of a young learner would appear on the screen, asking for help, either via a chat box or through a video link. The teachers reminded me of workers in the gig economy, the Uber drivers of education. When I logged on to try out a Squirrel English lesson for myself, the experience was good, but my tutor seemed to be teaching to a script.Squirrel AI’s head of communications, Joleen Liang, showed me photos from a recent trip she had taken to the remote mountains of Henan, to deliver laptops to disadvantaged students. Without access to the adaptive technology, their education would be a little worse. It was a reminder that Squirrel AI’s platform, like those of its competitors worldwide, doesn’t have to be better than the best human teachers – to improve people’s lives, it just needs to be good enough, at the right price, to supplement what we’ve got. The problem is that it is hard to see technology companies stopping there. For better and worse, their ambitions are bigger. “We could make a lot of geniuses,” Li told me.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bd9767d665353f69914aa1589b610c426e656d9/423_425_4260_2556/master/4260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d0a84ecc1b477bde6ad7261dad9ecb","title":"samsung galaxy s20 ultra review the superphone thats a little too massive","story":"New flagship smartphone is supersized in all dimensions with a giant 6.9in screen, massive zoom camera and ginormous priceSamsung’s new Galaxy S20 Ultra superphone is packed to the brim with chart-topping features, including 100x zooming, 108MP cameras, a ginormous screen and 5G.The £1,199 S20 Ultra leads an important new lineup of 5G-as-standard smartphones from Samsung, which looks to make the technology a normal part of mobile life rather than an expensive add-on for early adopters.But in 2020 5G alone isn’t enough to stand out, so the S20 Ultra has a smorgasbord of stats and features that, on paper at least, make it unbeatable.First is the sheer size of the thing. It has a 6.9in QHD+ display, which is practically the size of a tablet. It is 222g in weight and 76mm wide, which is right at the limit of what I can handle. The 166.9mm length makes it difficult to pocket without injuring yourself or the phone when you sit down.The glass is slippery when cold or put on the sofa, but the phone is so big I can’t see many using it without some sort of case or a handle.The screen’s 120Hz refresh rate is twice the standard 60Hz, and faster still than last year’s OnePlus 7 Pro and Pixel 4. Animations and scrolling through lists, sites and other content is so much smoother at 120Hz that it’s difficult to go back to 60Hz, even if that limits the resolution to FHD+.Flip the phone over and you’ll find the super-sized lump containing four cameras and a flash in the top left corner. It’s big, sticks out miles and you can feel it with your fingers when you use the phone.The S20 Ultra is the first smartphone to ship in Europe with Samsung’s latest Exynos 990 processor. In the US it has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 instead. Both variants come with 12 or 16GB of RAM, which is more than most laptops.Performance all round was brilliant. Snappy, responsive and smooth, even with graphically intensive games. Like everything else, the battery is supersized in the S20 Ultra, with a capacity of 5,000mAh, which is about 1,000mAh bigger than the one in the iPhone 11 Pro Max or OnePlus 7T Pro, and bigger than the 4,500mAh battery in the S10 5G.Battery life ranges from an excellent 42 hours on 4G with the screen set to FHD+ at 60Hz, to 40 hours with that upped to 120Hz, and a solid 38 hours on Vodafone’s 5G with 120Hz active. The S20 Ultra will get through even the heaviest of days without needing a charge.Fully charging the S20 Ultra took 70 minutes with the included power adapter, but closer to two hours with other 30-45W USB-C chargers. Fast 15W wireless charging and 7W wireless power-sharing is also available – great for charging your Galaxy Buds+ or other Qi-compatible phones from the back of the S20 Ultra.Samsung does not rate the battery in the S20 Ultra for a set number of charge cycles (which is typically 500) but does provide a one-year warranty. Despite being rated as difficult to repair, Samsung says the device is generally repairable and that the battery is replaceable, by authorised service centres at costs likely to be in excess of £200.The Galaxy S20 Ultra runs the same version of Samsung-customised Android 10, called One UI 2, as the Galaxy Z Flip.One UI has become one of the best implementations of Android, particularly for big-screen smartphones, because it treats the top of the screen as an information display section and the bottom – the bit you can actually reach with your thumb – as a place for all interactions.You have to use Samsung’s apps to really take advantage of it, but broadly it works very well. You can also do split-screen multitasking, have apps float over other apps (not just video), duplicate messaging apps such as WhatsApp so you can have two accounts on one phone, quickly manage two sims from the notification shade, and a plethora of other features.One UI 2 defaults to the traditional three-button Android navigation bar, but Android 10’s new gesture navigation system makes using the super-sized screen easier.Samsung guarantees only two major Android versions from release. It provides monthly security updates for its devices but does not commit to a particularly length of support, instead listing the current support status of handsets on its security site. Other models such as the Galaxy S7 Edge from 2016 are currently receiving only quarterly security updates.Apple supports its iPhones for approximately five years, including security and full iOS version updates. Google offers about three years of security and version updates for its Pixel line, while OnePlus offers two years of software plus another year of security updates.Samsung has recently made great strides, but you will still likely have to wait in the region of three months for major version Android updates to appear after Google releases them. £1,199 is also a lot of money to pay for a phone that is only guaranteed updates for two years.The massive lump on the back of the phone contains Samsung’s new quad-camera system: a large 108MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, 48MP telephoto with periscopic 4x optical zoom and a depth sensor. There’s a 40MP front-facing camera poking through a small hole in the screen too.Samsung’s camera system has taken a big leap forward over the last year, after lagging behind competitors from Apple, Google and Huawei. The quartet of cameras allows you to smoothly zoom from ultrawide angle (0.5x), through the wide angle (1x) and out to 4x optical zoom, then on to 10x hybrid zoom. From there you’re into what Samsung calls “Space Zoom”, which is essentially a digital zoom on top, taking you all the way to 100x magnification.The 12MP ultrawide camera produces some really good shots in most lighting conditions, excellent for creating a fisheye effect close up or for capturing more of a cityscape in one shot.The main 108MP camera shoots 12MP photos by default, combining nine pixels on the sensor into one pixel of final image, in a process known as pixel binning. The resulting photos are great, striking an excellent balance of detail and low noise, although occasionally a little over-sharpened on full crop, even in the kind of middling light of British homes where previous Samsung cameras struggled. Samsung’s dedicated night mode is good but not quite on the same level as Night Sight on the Pixel 4, taking considerably longer to take the same shots.The live focus portrait mode is improved too, but given that the wide-angle camera takes images with plenty of natural bokeh, I found I didn’t need to use the artificial mode. The camera app has the usual array of beautifying and smoothing features, if that’s your jam.The camera can also shoot full 108MP shots, but I found that most of the time the 12MP mode produced better images. It’s nice to have the creative option, though, as you can crop right into a 108MP image for a closeup without using a zoom.The zoom is the star of the show though, rivalling the previous zoom king, the Huawei P30 Pro, which uses a similar periscope lens system for a 5x optical zoom. Shots at 4x optical zoom are best, but push it to 10x and, while not quite lossless, the images are very good indeed, blowing everything but the P30 Pro out of the water.Zooming to 30x, images are still very good, while Samsung’s 50x zoom beats Huawei’s equivalent from a year ago. The 100x headline figure isn’t really worth using except as a surrogate pair of binoculars, as images are full of artefacts. It’s also worth noting it is very difficult to hold steady at 100x, despite Samsung’s excellent picture-in-picture aiming box that pops up to help hit the target over 20x magnification.The S20 Ultra also captures very good video, arguably the best on Android. It will shoot up to 8K video, consuming upwards of 10MB a second in the process, but stabilisation and effects are limited to 1080p.The 40MP selfie camera shoots 10MP images by default, again using pixel binning, and produces some of the very best, most detailed shots I’ve seen on any selfie camera.The S20 Ultra has the same ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded underneath the screen as the S10 and Note 10 series of smartphones, but it performed slightly better in my testing.Land your clean, dry finger on the correct spot on the screen and the phone unlocks pretty fast. It also worked better once I removed the included screen protector and re-registered my fingerprints. But it’s neither as fast nor as forgiving as the best in-display fingerprint sensors used by OnePlus in the 7T Pro, nor Face ID on the iPhone 11 or Face Unlock on the Pixel 4.The Galaxy S20 Ultra is Samsung’s superphone to conquer all superphones. Everything pushed to excess.That excess is great when it means a massive battery, future-proofed 5G and a camera that’s leagues ahead of where Samsung was a year ago. The combination of great main, ultra-wide and 4x optical cameras, with a 10x hybrid zoom, is so flexible and fun to use. Even at zooms of 30x you get pretty good pictures, and 100x zoom can substitute for binoculars in a pinch.But all that excess also makes the phone far too big: I can barely fit it in my pocket and I wouldn’t be comfortable using it as my own phone without some sort of ring or Popsocket on the back.It’s also incredibly expensive: £1,200 is a lot of money for a phone, particularly one only guaranteed to receive two years of updates from release, but then you can easily spend that on an iPhone. And despite all the features and finesse, the massive black slab looks positively boring next to the Galaxy Z Flip.There’s no doubt that the Galaxy S20 Ultra is one of Samsung’s best phones to date. I just wish all that camera was squeezed into something considerably smaller and cheaper.Pros: 120Hz screen, 5G, great and flexible camera, long battery life, microSD card slot, dual sim, One UI, wireless charging and powershare, fast performanceCons: absolutely massive, very expensive, no headphone socket, ultrasonic fingerprint sensor not as good as competitors This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I share the view that Covid-19 could cause a permanent shift towards home working.Second, who is paying for homeworking equipment and services: you or your employer?If you are paying for your own kit, you may want to take an economical approach. But if the company is insisting that you work from home, ask for ergonomic equipment. This often costs more, but is worth it in the long run.One of the IT department’s jobs is to make choices for tens or even tens of thousands of employees. You may not like their choices – I usually don’t – but letting everybody pick their own collaborative software, messaging app or video conferencing system doesn’t work. Of course, this doesn’t prevent people from setting up unofficial groups on WhatsApp or Facebook.The good news is that you may end up being more productive when you don’t spend hours commuting or in meetings, taking long lunches or catching up with the latest gossip.The bad news is that you have to set and stick to office routines without the external pressure to turn up on time, take regular meal breaks, and keep to a reasonable sleep schedule. Every company has early birds and night owls, so their work times are likely to erge. However, you must overlap during some agreed office hours when everyone is always available.Self-discipline is why much of the advice about working from home includes things such as getting dressed for work, even though you might work just as well in your dressing gown. But if you talk to colleagues or customers over video links, you must keep up appearances. You will be judged.Laptops have bad ergonomics so you should not use them for sustained periods of work. You can solve this problem by making your laptop work like a desktop, by putting it on a commercial riser or a pile of books and plugging in an external keyboard and mouse. Your eyebrows should be roughly level with the top of the screen, so you can work without slouching.Buy a docking station if you can. If you plug your laptop and all the peripherals into a docking station, you only need to unplug a single cable from the laptop to be able to take it somewhere else. That makes it easy to get a change of scene by working in another room or in the garden.Otherwise, the supreme law for working from home is thou shalt not lose thy work. Make hitting Ctrl-S (for save) a reflex action. Save files to your local hard drive and to an online drive (OneDrive is built into Windows 10), and back them up to an external hard drive or USB thumb drive. Even if you are saving your work on a company server or in an online office suite – such as Microsoft, Google or Zoho – you may need a local copy if your comms link goes down.Much the best way to work at home is to set up a proper office in a spare bedroom, junk room, attic, conservatory, garden shed or David Cameron-style shepherd’s hut. If you have a family, your home office should have a door with a “keep out” or perhaps an “on air” sign. So many people are now making podcasts, video conferencing or appearing on live TV from home offices that studio-style “on air” signs – even neon ones – are becoming a thing. It helps avoid the spousepartner andor kids wandering in, to humorous effect.Having dedicated office space means you can have a proper desk, an adjustable office chair, one or more large monitors and a desktop PC that will deliver more power than a laptop for less cost. You might even be tempted to buy a standing desk or a “desk riser” such as the Yo Yo Desk 90 (British) or the Varidesk Pro Plus 36. Sit-Stand has these and many other models.For more advice, see my recent answer: How do I set up an ergonomic home office?That answer didn’t cover video conferencing, which will be important for many people pushed out of their corporate nests. Even if it’s not essential for meetings, it’s useful for quick video chats with colleagues. This fosters camaraderie, especially if you start to feel lonely working on your own. It’s also easy to do, thanks to software such as Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, TeamViewer and more.Broadband shouldn’t be a problem because peak usage is in the evenings when many people are streaming movies or TV or playing games such as Fortnite. Even if everyone starts video chatting, there is easily enough capacity for home workers during the day. However, you should either have an unlimited business broadband service, like me, or a cellular backup based on a mobile router like a Mifi or tethering a smartphone or whatever.Either way, your plan B should include an alternative device – a smartphone or tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard, or a spare laptop – and an alternative way of connecting to the office, even if it means using a hotspot while parked outside a local coffee shop. Sort out all the log-in and connection details and test it before you actually need it. You probably won’t be able to do much work without an internet connection.Almost every operating system supports multiple users, so set up a separate account for work. Make this account look as much like your office PC as possible, with the same wallpaper and the same icons in much the same places. That way, you won’t be distracted by whatever games, social media or entertainment services you use when not working.Using a separate account eliminates all your personal websites from your browsers and browser tabs. Having PornHub loaded is never a good look, even if you don’t accidentally switch to it.Have you got a question?

This is the first in a series of weekly Q\u0026ampAs• Click here to ask a travel question We have received hundreds of questions from readers about changes to travel plans as a result of the coronavirus crisis. We are unable to respond to everyone directly but will endeavour to answer as many as we can over the coming weeks. Please bear with us and rest assured that we are working through them as fast as we can.First, some general advice: travel companies are working round the clock to deal with the many thousands of queries from customers who are either still in destinations and trying to get home, as well as those due to travel imminently or with trips planned for later in the year. For those with travel plans that are not imminent, the advice is to postpone rather than cancel, if at all possible. Most companies have introduced special booking policies that allow customers to rebook, often into 2021, or get a credit for a future departure.Companies are working through the many thousands of queries in date order, so if your trip is not until later in the year you are unlikely to get an immediate response. However, virtually every travel company has introduced special booking policies in response to the crisis, offering more flexibility in terms of rebooking or cancelling. Check the website of your travel provider for their terms and conditions.Jay from Ipswich has a trip for a family of four booked with Jet2holidays to Montenegro at the end of July. He has paid a deposit of £240, plus £600 towards paying off the holiday, with full payment due by mid-May.Jay says, “Our main concern is that with all the cancellations to other European destinations as well as, I assume, a drop in revenue, is Jet2holidays strong enough to handle such a decline in revenue? And is it a possibility that we start seeing some tour operators go into administration or seek financial bailouts? If this happens, where do we stand with trying to get our money back ?”There is no doubt that travel companies are under massive strain, with many fighting to survive. It’s impossible to predict which ones will collapse. Under the current Package Travel Regulations, travellers are entitled to be repatriated or receive a refund if a company goes into administration. However, travel bodies are asking the government to change the regulations as soon as possible, as they cannot afford to keep refunding travellers who can’t travel at the moment (another stipulation of the regulations), so these may change.At the moment, Jet2holidays has suspended its flights and holidays departing from the UK until 30 April. But it says, “We plan to recommence from 1 May 2020, a decision we’ll keep under constant review.”However, if she wants to postpone her trip, the tickets now have an additional six-month validity extension on the original 11-month window in which she could choose a start date. So a traveller who purchased a ticket in March 2020 has until August 2021. This applies to all travellers who purchased their passes on or after 1 June 2019 and before 1 April 2020.Margaret Dakin was about to leave the UK for an extended stay of six months in Corfu with her husband. She was due to take a ferry from the UK to France on 2 April, and another from Italy to mainland Greece on 5 April. Her return crossing from France to the UK was booked for 14 October.She has received a refund from Minoan Ferries, as all ferries between Greece and Italy have been cancelled. However, she wants to know whether she can get a refund for the Dover-Dunkirk crossing with DFDS.Under normal circumstances DFDS does not offer refunds on return bookings – and that still applies even now. The company continues to operate its crossings to Calais and Dunkirk as it is still carrying freight and some French nationals returning home. Its coronavirus policy states that for travel until 30 April it is offering either free rebooking or free cancellation and a credit equivalent to be used as a payment on future sailings. Travel credits expire on 31 December and must be redeemed for travel by 30 March 2021.Because Margaret has a return booking she is not entitled to a refund, but she will be entitled to change the departure date of her Dover-Dunkirk crossing. However, when the  contacted DFDS to ask about her particular – and unusual – circumstances DFDS said it was looking at each booking on a case-by-case basis and advised her to email a request. There is a possibility she may receive a refund.Like every other travel company, DFDS has a reduced number of staff dealing with a vast number of enquiries. The best option for anyone who has a booking and is uncertain whether they can travel, or doesn’t want to travel, is to look at the company’s FAQs then email the company, stating your specific details.Asks Phil from Swindon. At the moment, yes. James Warner-Smith, editor at Cool Camping, which has 600 UK campsites on its website, says, “Right now, we have not heard from any campsite that plans to close or shift their opening dates. In fact, many are pushing the message of ‘fresh air and space’.”According to Martin Smith at campsites: “The situation is changing rapidly in reaction to news announcements, and in the absence of any guidance to the contrary, campsites are being left to make the most appropriate decisions for them.“Currently, many campsites are remaining open with suitable precautions, such as enhanced cleaning, appropriate staff training, fewer guests and more space between pitches, closure of some facilities, and good advice for guests while others are delaying their normal season opening date until a clearer picture emerges.”Caravan and Motorhome Club sites are also currently still open, but bars and restaurants are closed. Updates are being posted on its website and on social media.With the threat of lockdown in London imminent, and the situation evolving by the hour, that is likely to change. Keep an eye on the websites for further updates.A lot of readers are asking whether they should cancel plans to visit friends abroadgo to weddings abroadhave friends visit them from abroad. Rosie from Melbourne says, “My question is around my rights as a UK citizen living abroad (I’m a permanent resident in Australia), could I be stranded? If I fly to the UK then Italy for a wedding, would I be stranded in the UK and unable to return home to Australia for, potentially, a long time ?”Rosie doesn’t say when she plans to travel, but right now it’s not only not a good idea, it’s just not possible. Borders and airports are closing and airlines are cancelling flights, so there is a high risk of getting stranded. The crisis has reached the point where citizens may not automatically get help from their government if they do become stranded. Best advice: stay at home.

Well, guess what? You are out of excuses. Start watching Lost straight away. Watch the early seasons, where it was a tightly wound mystery series starring a small band of compelling characters. Watch the middle bit, where the show treaded water with episodes that had no larger bearing on the overall series. Watch the end, where the wheels came off and it turned into a genuinely absurd sci-fi about time travel and nuclear explosions. Then watch the finale, and tell me that you didn’t enjoy it. Stuart HeritageThis is regularly lauded as one of the finest serial dramas in TV history. Plenty of shows have tried to do what this one did, but none have come close. Beginning in 1964, Peter Flannery’s series follows four friends (sublimely played by Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee, Daniel Craig and Mark Strong) as they navigate lives in the context of the British political upheavals of the late 20th century. But while their personal dramas are punctuated by the economic crises of the 70s, the dawning of Thatcher in 1979 and the miners’ strike of the mid-80s, the political elements never feel heavy-handed. Instead, they feel like functions of the inidual personalities, part of the accumulation of their lived experiences, their hopes and dreams. The politics matter. But not as much as the people. Phil HarrisonThis devastating docu-series is not an obvious binge, with its themes of murder, sexual abuse and a potential decades-long coverup by the Catholic church. However, its hugely intimate portraits of a group of retired women hunting for justice for their former schoolteacher is completely absorbing. Over seven episodes, we discover the rumours and suspicions that abound regarding Sister Cathy Cesnik’s disappearance in Baltimore in 1969. The bravery that the women display, combined with the chilling nature of the case and the care in its presentation – devoid of voyeurism – combine to make something that is extraordinarily moving and troubling. Unlike so many other true-crime tales, this is one series where its victims are treated as people. Hannah J DaviesSkyNow TV AmazonWhat better way to spend your time at home than watching a set of people going out of their way to help each other and improve their community? Focusing on local government workers in the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, Parks and Rec (as it is known by fans) began as a kind of faux documentary, an Office rip-off – but swiftly developed into so much more. It is the sheer, radiant positivity of its main character, Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), that enables the ensemble of quirky, likable faces to shine. It is also funny as hell, launching the careers of Chris Pratt (nearly unrecognisable from the action hero he has become), Aubrey Plaza and Nick Offerman. Scott BryanRemember the 00s, when we smoked in the office, wore sleek double-breasted suits and were constantly half-cut after downing a bottle of bourbon before lunch? No, wait, that was TV – when half the world was caught up in Mad Men fever and the abusive, adulterous, drunkard Don Draper (Jon Hamm in a career-best performance) somehow became the man every woman wanted to bed and the lothario every man wanted to be. This slice of mid-century nostalgia set in the advertising industry perhaps has not retained the same sense of awe as other TV greats of that era – but it is littered with acting talent (Elisabeth Moss! John Slattery! Christina Hendricks!) and, in his examination of Draper’s descent, Matthew Weiner wrote one of the most fascinating character studies ever put to screen. The clothes are fabulous, too. Toby MosesAll4Along with The Simpsons, Seinfeld is patient zero of modern comedy. If you were to watch it for the first time now, you might not get a sense of how revolutionary it was at the time, but that is because every other comedy made in the past two decades has absorbed its sensibility. Even if you have not seen it, you talk the way you talk because of Seinfeld. In one sense, bingeing Seinfeld in 2020 is an act of historical exploration. Then again, it remains one of the funniest shows ever made. Watch the shaky beginning, before it perfected its tone. Watch the locomotive years, when nothing else on television could touch it. It is just a shame about the finale. Stuart HeritageNetflixSure, Ricky Gervais now spends his days making sub-par jokes about how the world has gone PC mad and only he – a very wealthy, successful comedian – can see the light, but the world has much to thank him for. Not least The Office, a titan of a mockumentary, which plumbed new depths of cringe. As David Brent, Gervais was a trailblazer of the self-obsessed, megalomaniacal boss before such people ended up on reality TV (see: The Apprentice) and even running the world. As a progenitor of the sadcom that has, from Fleabag to Transparent, dominated TV ever since, in many ways The Office is one of the saddest shows you can watch. But it is also a total joy to behold – especially those Christmas specials. Hannah J DaviesNetflixBuckle in for a riot of showbiz ego in this French comedy about the disastrous personal lives and glittering careers of the staff of one of Paris’s leading talent agencies. As they struggle to keep afloat amid various financial and creative crises, the agents veer through personal melodramas from ill-advised trysts to infidelities, paternity tests and even – if you stick with it – a birth on the office floor. Such is the show’s genius, and genuine adoration for the art of film, that many stars – even Juliette Binoche – play themselves in it. An additional bonus is that it is a great way to brush up on your rusty French. I started dreaming in French after ploughing through all three series in a matter of days. Jenny StevensNetflixRyan Murphy had already established himself as the king of the anthology series with American Horror Story by the time this strand of the series, American Crime Story, rolled around. His shows worked on a brilliant formula – hire a bunch of actors too tremendous to agree to multiple seasons, tell a single story and then get out again. With The People vs OJ Simpson, the formula hit paydirt. Cuba Gooding Jr was electric as Simpson John Travolta was an excellent Robert Shapiro and David Schwimmer was a surprisingly convincing Robert Kardashian. Its greatest trick, though, was how it walked the line between journalism and flashy exploitation with such incredible ease. This is the perfect way to set yourself up for Impeachment, the American Crime Story series about the ClintonLewinsky affair, coming whenever we are allowed out of the house again. Stuart HeritageSally Wainwright’s pitch-black police drama puts Sarah Lancashire front and centre – which is always a good thing. She excels as a plain-speaking sergeant, grieving over the suicide of her daughter while patrolling her North Yorkshire town – a hotspot of rape, murder and drug dealing. It had a star-making turn from James Norton, now one of the favourites to be the next Bond, but here playing a thoroughly nasty piece of work. It is certainly not an easy watch, and Lancashire’s brutal assault in the first series leaves its mark – on both the character and the viewer – but there are few British dramas of the past decade than can match this. Toby MosesAvailable to buy on AmazonHere is the original Scandi drama, or “Nordic noir”, for anyone still wondering what all the fuss was about. Copenhagen-based detective inspector Sarah Lund (Sofie Gråbøl) is finishing her final days on the job before joining her fiance in Sweden, when a 19-year-old woman is found raped and murdered. Lund delays her transfer and gets to work, eventually teaming up with her replacement, Jan Meyer (Søren Malling), for an investigation that moves slowly by comparison with traditional case-of-the-week crime dramas. Each episode represents 24 hours of police work, but the series also explores a family’s grief and political corruption to gripping effect. You will come for the famous knitwear, but stay for the peerless storytelling. Ellen E JonesBBC iPlayerThe upbeat and moving account of a group of budding lawyers living in a houseshare just south of the Thames in London has recently been fondly re-appreciated thanks to its arrival on BBC iPlayer. Although at first it looks quite different from the precarious lives of today’s twentysomethings, themes of entering the world of work, figuring out who you are and getting trashed still resonate. As do the lovably flawed characters, particularly Anna (Daniela Nardini) and Miles (Jack Davenport). The sexual tension is so electrifying it is amazing that the house did not burn down. A backdrop of 90s club culture (most memorably when Anna takes Egg’s dad clubbing) and a soundtrack deeply ingrained in the era only adds to the nostalgia. Sarah PhillipsThis may sound a little too close to home, given current events, but the joy in Charlie Covell’s graphic novel adaptation is how it spins away from its dark premise and your initial expectations towards a modern, youthful take on Bonnie and Clyde. Student and social outcast James (Alex Lawther) is convinced that he is a psychopath with a hunger to kill, setting his sights on fellow oddball Alyssa (Jessica Barden). It may not seem like the ideal start point for a touching romance, but the road trip that ensues offers a tender and thought-provoking exploration of adolescence, a rallying cry for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. Its minimalist style and stark, western-inspired visuals are immediately striking – but the sparkling dialogue is what will keep you coming back. The response of Alyssa to a shopkeeper who is dissatisfied with his life stays with me to this day: “Then do something.” Scott BryanAll4Best known as Arrested Development’s plucky Maeby, Alia Shawkat came into her own in this full-throttle black comedy about a young woman who goes missing and the egotistical Brooklynites who have to find her (among them, the dangerously narcissistic Elliott (John Early) and Portia (Meredith Hagner), who is entirely devoid of self-awareness. While the first run is a perfect, self-contained whodunnit, a couple of huge twists allowed it to stretch into a second series, with another on the way. A show that is as scary as it is entirely ludicrous (watch out for the cult operating from under a luxe jewellery store), Search Party has a way of hooking you in, even if, invariably, you will end up in a lovehate relationship with its central clique and Shawkat’s backbone-free Dory. Hannah J DaviesAvailable to buy on AmazonOnce upon a time, a same-sex storyline on a TV show was such a rarity that even a hint of gayish subtext was enough to guarantee a queer audience. These days, it does not feel like the unicorn rarity it once did. In part, that is thanks to The L Word, which arrived in 2004 (and was recently rebooted). Elements of this brilliantly soapy saga have aged about as well as you would expect of a show that asked questions about gender and sexuality more than 15 years ago, but it remains a total hoot, offering high-stakes drama with a campy flair that becomes more pronounced as it progresses. You can have a ball just wondering exactly how any key character’s personality is going to be dramatically overhauled from one season to the next. Rebecca NicholsonNetflixWhat you need now, more than anything, is warmth. And The Royle Family has warmth in spades. This is a show so warm that, in one episode, two adults sing No Surprises by Radiohead to a sleeping baby and it seems like the most tender act in all of history. Let The Royle Family act as your surrogate family in the coming weeks. A bunch of familiar faces, sitting on well-worn sofas, aimlessly trading affectionate insults for half an hour at a time sounds like an absolute balm at the minute. This is comfort TV at its most comfortable. Stuart HeritageA raucously funny romantic comedy for grownups. Over four snappy seasons, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney depict how messy relationships can be with unflinching honesty. The show follows the romance between a middle-aged couple played by the co-creators. What starts as a holiday fling moves into a long-term relationship when Horgan gets pregnant. What follows is a poignant, hilarious look at the difficulties facing all couples. Each episode is crammed with brilliantly filthy and at times downright savage one-liners that get to the heart of sex, marriage, parenthood and the sheer hard work it takes to stay in love, especially when life and all its troubles get in the way. This is a believable love story between two very likable but flawed iniduals portrayed with warmth and acidic charm. Ann LeeBBC iPlayerAlthough she has been in showbiz since childhood, Pamela Adlon was once best known for her Louis CK collaborations (she played a love interest on his sitcom, Louie, and he co-wrote Better Things’ first season). But while Louis CK’s reputation took a #MeToo-related e (Adlon described his behaviour as “abhorrent”), her star has continued her rise. She stars here as Sam Fox, a working actress and single mother to three teenage daughters, living in a languid, sometimes dreamlike Los Angeles. Sure, everyone has their own semi-autobiographical comedy-drama these days, but Better Things has undersold itself. This is the best of all possible things: a feminist Curb Your Enthusiasm with more heart – and more womb – than all the other pretenders put together. Ellen E JonesAll4The word “iconic” is too often thrown around, but never has it felt more apt than to describe Queer as Folk. The series did not just introduce the British public to queerness it confidently bludgeoned them with it – with the opening episode alone featuring underage sex, threesomes and rimming. Try explaining that to your mum. As well as being unapologetic, it was joyful, explicit – euphoric, even – in its depiction of queer (male) life. Written and created by Russell T Davies, it follows three gay men living and loving on Manchester’s gay scene. It launched the careers of Charlie Hunnam (now of sub-par Hollywood fare) and Aidan Gillen from The Wire and Game of Thrones, but more importantly it put gay sex on terrestrial TV – and for that a whole generation of teenage boys will be for ever grateful. Dylan B JonesAmazonBased on the HG Bissinger book about Texan high-school football culture, the show begins with an accident that paralyses Dillon High’s star quarterback, Jason Street (Scott Porter). It is left to eager new coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and his wife, Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), a guidance counsellor, to pick up the pieces, while handling other crises – from absent parents to addiction – that afflict the town’s teenagers. You need not like (or even understand) American football to enjoy the show in no time at all, the wonderfully captured drama on the field will captivate you just as much as the drama off it. Through five seasons of agonising twists and turns – perhaps most dramatically with Tyra and Landry’s devastating storyline in the second (even if the ramifications were quickly brushed under the carpet) – the team’s motto burns brightly: “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” Sarah PhillipsNetflixBBC iPlayerYou shouldn’t need an opportunity to rewatch The Thick of It. You could watch it a million times in a row and Armando Iannucci’s political satire would still maintain its bite. If you haven’t seen it since the altogether more slick Veep, you might be taken aback by how joyously ramshackle this cheap little no-risk BBC Four sitcom feels. But that is part of its charm. When Malcolm Tucker bares his teeth for the first time in the first scene of the first episode, it is like stumbling across a found-footage horror film. It’s nightmarish. You might not think now is a good time to watch a show about the incompetent failings of national government. But, if you have the stomach for it, there’s nothing better. Stuart HeritageThey’re here, they’re queer, and they’re about to get you a whole new wardrobe (and house!). The Queer Eye reboot – helmed by the fab five of Jonathan, Antoni, Karamo, Tan and Bobby – saw the 00s makeover show get a whole new lease of life, via questionable avocado recipes and incredible interior design. By focusing more closely on the inner struggles of its participants, helping people who had seemingly fallen through the cracks to regain their confidence, and rectify the areas which needed fixing in their lives – from broken relationships to coming out – it became “more than a makeover”. If the Japanese spinoff felt like overkill, there are still four other series to blitz through. Hannah J DaviesSkyNow TV Given what it was – a mystery show with no real intention of answering its own mystery, made by a figure who specialises in deliberately oblique storytelling – the original Twin Peaks was a blockbuster of a show, with an old-school riddle at its heart. A girl died. A good-hearted stranger comes to town to investigate. Then weirdness ensues. But, at least to my mind, the 2017 sequel has now become the definitive Twin Peaks. Aggressively avant garde in places, and truly terrifying in others, it is like nothing else that has ever been on television. It is not an easy watch by any means. In fact, sometimes it is downright maddening. But nevertheless, it will affect you in ways you didn’t think you could be affected. Stuart HeritageEver wanted to see Lovejoy scream “cocksucker” at a procession of bemused cowboys? Then this is the show for you. Set in the “hey!”-day of the wild west, with a host of real-life historical figures such as Wyatt Earp and Calamity Jane popping in and out of its small South Dakota town, Deadwood’s stellar reputation never translated into viewing figures, leading to its premature cancellation after three seasons. Luckily, the storylines were rounded out in a feature-length special last year, making now the perfect time to appreciate this thoroughly modern western. Ian McShane chews the scenery as the saloon owner Al Swearengen, but it is Timothy Olyphant, playing the long-suffering sheriff, who holds it all together. If you are not hooked after the first four episodes, culminating in the depiction of the real-life murder of Wild Bill Hickok (an all-too-brief turn from Keith Carradine), there is something wrong with you. And if all else fails, just count the F-bombs there are 43 in the first hour alone. Toby MosesNetflix It may have been created for a pre-streaming world, but there are few sitcoms as binge-friendly as the Bluth family’s madcap saga. Stuffed to the gills with callbacks and inter-show references, Arrested Development benefits hugely from back-to-back (and repeat) viewing – and the impressive gag-rate and endlessly ridiculous narrative accelerations mean the episodes simply fly by. Masterminded by The Ellen Show co-creator Mitchell Hurwitz, Arrested Development began airing in 2003, with three near-peerless seasons before it was cancelled, only to be resurrected for two more disappointing outings on Netflix. Nonetheless, we will always have those early years tracing the many trials (sometimes literally) of the extremely rich, extremely entitled and extremely eccentric Newport Beach crew. Cue layers of cartoonish plotlines, catchphrases galore and a veritable labyrinth of addictively quotable in-jokes not to mention some of greatest slapstick that television comedy has ever seen. Rachel AroestiNetflix A true millennial phenomenon. The idea of a feminist musical sitcom that majors on mental health issues might cause eyes to roll. But don’t switch over to Friends just yet. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is hilarious, pioneering and eminently watchable. It has caused controversy since first being aired in 2015, chronicling the life struggles of its main character Rebecca (played wonderfully by its writer-creator Rachel Bloom) – from her obsessive fixations and borderline personality disorder, to suicide attempts and abortions – all with a sunny musical theatre soundtrack. What could be heavy, dramatic fare, is dealt with confidently, accompanied by a righteous wink the Cats special is a thing to behold, and Period Sex will be stuck in your head for weeks. Bloom has been nominated for multiple Emmies, Glaad awards and Golden Globes for her performance, and rightly so – she shines. But the supporting cast are beautifully played, too, with one of the most authentic portrayals of bisexuality ever put to screen in Pete Gardner’s Darryl Whitefeather. Dylan B JonesAll dressed up with nowhere to go? Then try Next in Fashion, the Netflix reality show in which already competent and semi-established designers, stuck in the shadows of their big-name bosses, get to compete in front of an impressive array of fashion insiders, from Christopher Kane to Phillip Lim. Better still, its focus on bringing people up rather than putting them down offers a welcome reprieve from the more typically brutal world of TV talent competitions, and presenters Alexa Chung and Tan France provide warm, supportive, well-tailored shoulders to cry on. Plus, you don’t have to wait 10 weeks to find out who the winner will be the duo very much urge you to binge this, with a reminder to press “next episode” at the end of every episode. Rebecca NicholsonAll4 Between 2004 and 2013 the writer Paul Abbott embedded us in Manchester’s Chatsworth council estate, with the sprawling, chaotic Gallagher family, headed up – nominally – by their drunkard dad Frank (David Threlfall) and, actually, by his eldest daughter Fiona (Anne-Marie Duff). So much good came from the Gallaghers: Fiona’s unutterably sweet on-screen romance with Steve led to the real-life marriage of Duff and co-star James McAvoy Maxine Peake built her reputation as fearsome neighbour Veronica, and stories were told about British working-class life without condescension or judgment. Are the Gallaghers the type of family to have a coat of arms? Probably not. But if they were, its motto would read: “Honi soit qui mal y pense” – Shame on those who see shame in it. Ellen E JonesThere are so many things about Sex Education that may irritate at first. Why does the school look so American – right down to the lettered bomber jackets – despite being set (and filmed) in rural Britain? For that matter, why film in Wales yet feature no one with a Welsh accent? And let’s not forget that hardy perennial: why do most of its teenagers look about 30? (Answer: because they are.) But be patient get past that. The show may attempt to lure you in with Inbetweeners-style crudeness, but it unfolds into a thoughtful, well-paced comedy drama, with an almost public-service zeal for exploring the issues around sex and relationships with sensitivity and warmth. There is, of course, the show’s breakout star too, Ncuti Gatwa (real age 27). He has become a meme as lead character Otis’s out-and-proud gay best friend, Eric, and is now a rather unexpected spokesperson for the coronavirus pandemic, with his line after spotting another character leaving the toilets without washing their hands doing more to stop the spread of the virus than any Boris Johnson press conference: “Wash your hands, you detty pig.” Scott BryaniPlayer There are few voices more soothing than David Attenborough’s, and here he narrates what must be one of the greatest nature documentaries of all time, and certainly the most visually stunning. While its 2017 sequel (also on iPlayer) played a vital role in shifting attitudes towards plastic pollution around the world, it started here, with the the original Blue Planet in 2001, which took five years to make and is still one of Attenborough’s career highlights. The sheer beauty of all that it uncovered is wonderfully escapist in itself (episode two, The Deep, is a psychedelic wonder), and at a pinch, it may also provide just a little of what’s needed in times like these: travel without travelling, education without crowds, and a reminder of the respect we must have for the unforgiving power of nature. Rebecca NicholsonMalorie Blackman’s hit young adult series arrived earlier this month, its tale of star-crossed lovers separated because of their races and backgrounds seeming more urgent as bigotry continues its worrying resurgence. Over six episodes – all of which are available to stream now – this Romeo and Juliet in a race-reversed society draws you into a world where the microagressions and discrimination frequently suffered by people of colour are drawn into sharp relief, and the lines between rich and poor are more pronounced than ever. Besides this, it is also a gripping tale of families with hidden secrets, changing allegiances and, of course, love. Peaky Blinders’ Jack Rowan and newcomer Masali Baduza are captivating as the leads, while Paterson Joseph is among its strong ensemble. Hannah J DaviesSky GoNowTVAmazon Prime Video Modern Family is a show you can bond with, settling into and going the distance with its 10 series. Those 200-plus episodes, along with the ongoing 11th and final series, make the story of various factions of the Pritchett clan – including a gay couple with a daughter, introduced to a mainstream American audience as part of the happy warp and weft of normal suburban life – one of the longest running sitcoms in television history. Of course there have been peaks and troughs in that time, but it has always been of standout quality, with laugh-a-line scenes, some of which are so light and fleet that you barely catch them skimming past you, making every episode ripe for rewatching. Lucy ManganAs podcasts become ever more popular, so the number of pods that have been made into TV series continues to grow, from Homecoming (Amazon Prime Video) to Limetown (Facebook Watch). Chief among them is Dirty John, adapted from the hit Wondery show about a devious, bedraggled conman who wormed his way into the life of a moneyed businesswoman, Debra Newell, by posing as a successful anaesthesiologist (he was in fact a former nurse anaesthetist who had spent time in prison for fraud). The total gall displayed by John Meehan – as he attempted a Parasite-esque takeover of Newell’s life – would be enough to stun most people. But, combined with a helping of Netflix melodrama, it makes for a particularly shocking, if knowingly cheesy, watch. Hannah J DaviesAmazon Prime VideoThis Zooey Deschanel vehicle has two main things going for it. First, it is funny. Second, there are a lot of episodes. I adopted New Girl as my back-up binge show a couple of years ago, dropping in and out when there wasn’t anything exciting on, and I still haven’t made it to the finale. The best thing about an ensemble sitcom such as New Girl is that – if you hang in there for long enough – all the characters have their time to shine. Schmidt is the breakout character, but then he is eclipsed by the ornery Nick. And then, out of nowhere, Winston becomes the absurdist one who holds the whole show together. This is a series so egalitarian that even Megan Fox is able to become its funniest thing for a decent stretch of episodes. Stuart HeritageIncreasingly, you can just stroll down to your local supermarket to achieve an effect comparable to watching Russell T Davies’s 2019 future-shock family saga. With its grim projections about rampant populism, accelerating climate crisis, the madness of crowds and the bewildering pace of technological change, Years and Years felt worryingly on the nose when it aired last year. Suffice to say, its vision hasn’t got much more comforting in the meantime. But as horrifying – and frequently plausible – as the travails of the Lyons family were, the show does, eventually, speak to resilience and continuity. By the skin of their teeth, and not without a couple of casualties, the family keeps it together. And so, just about, does the country. Phil HarrisonNetflixThe sitcom previously known as Scrotal Recall was always far better than a show with that painful pun as a name had any right to be. But with a new moniker, and a shift to Netflix, fresh life was breathed into the tale of four twentysomethings navigating friendship, relationships and STIs post university. The laughs may be gentle, but the writing by Tom Edge is subtle and the characters well drawn, with Johnny Flynn (brother of Jerome) leading the cast as the chlamydia-infected Dylan tracking down his previous conquests to break the news. It’s a neat conceit, and the will theywon’t they romance with Antonia Thomas’s Evie is in the greatest of sitcom traditions – and far less frustrating when watched in one go. Toby MosesAll4The cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a feelgood proposition on every level. It is a properly funny comedy. It is undemanding moreish fare. It has charm, it has warmth, it has heart. Its characters are fundamentally united, chafing and rubbing together enough to strike comic sparks but essentially hanging together in the fight against the villainry. True antipathy or hostility has no place here. But best of all, and most valuably perhaps in our current times, it also shows every sign of the ensemble cast being free of it, too. It is impossible to know for sure, of course – the set may be a hotbed of hatred and warring egos – but one feels that the easy camaraderie on display is impossible to fake entirely. Add to that the joy of seeing Andre Braugher – Frank freaking Pembleton from Homicide: Life on the Streets, people! – in a light comic role and all that it left to say is, of course, NOICE! Lucy ManganAmazon Prime VideoBritBoxThey don’t, in so many senses, make them like this any more. ITV’s 1981 version of Evelyn Waugh’s 1945 novel was, with its 11-hour running time, not far off granting the wish of those viewers who like dramatisations to include every word of the book. That meant the world Waugh conjured – fading nobility, eccentric inter-war hedonism and grassy afternoons at a perfectly proper Oxford University – could be allowed to completely envelop the viewer. In the days before the big US box-set beasts, Brideshead Revisited was routinely cited as the best TV show of all time. In part, that was due to the exquisite score, the sky-high production values and the brilliant cast. But its appeal has always been mainly as a door to a fantasy of a bygone world. That’s now perhaps more valuable than ever. Jack SealeMaking a followup to Peep Show was always going to be tough for its writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and shorn of the natural comedic chemistry of Mitchell and Webb you might find yourself wondering where all the laughs have gone. But this is not a sitcom – it sits in that weird half-space, not quite a drama, not quite a comedy – where so many TV shows flounder. Yet Fresh Meat pulls through with a hugely talented young cast bringing to life a collection of university misfits adjusting to house-sharing – and hinted at the drama chops of Armstrong, who would go on to write Succession without his long-time collaborator. Jack Whitehall impresses as the posh dimwit best avoided in the uni bar, while Zawe Ashton’s beautifully surreal turn as Vod never fails to entertain, even if the thrill is somewhat diminished in the latter series when the character is pushed to the emotional forefront. Across four series, we see the characters mature, regress and mature again – before it reaches its natural endpoint with graduation.

That’s what happened earlier this month after the Super Tuesday contests on 3 March, and this Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.On Wednesday Sanders, the campaign said, would first vote on coronavirus legislation in the Senate and then later in the day he would fly with his wife Jane back to Vermont where he would have conversations with supporters.“The next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,” Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. “In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.”The Sanders campaign also sent out an email to supporters with a similarly gloomy tone.“No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,” Shakir wrote in that email. “And while our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.”The email did not include a usual link to make a donation to the campaign. Instead it linked to Sanders’ response on how the federal government should be responding to the coronavirus pandemic, a signal that the campaign is at least slightly inching away from a relentless campaign mode.There were three contests on Tuesday night and Biden beat Sanders in all of them. More ominous for Sanders, Biden beat him by double digits in all three states. Biden won decisively by about 14 points in Illinois.In 2016, Sanders narrowly lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton there by less than three percentage points. In Florida, Biden beat Sanders by almost 40 percentage points. In Arizona, Sanders lost to Biden by about the same margin he lost to Clinton in 2016.The prospect of Sanders dropping out is so strong that for a few moments on Wednesday a report about Sanders suspending campaign ads on Facebook was misread as Sanders suspending his campaign.The next set of contests are in states that were more favorable to Sanders in 2016 –Hawaii and Alaska, in particular. But the larger problem for the Vermont senator is the delegate math. As of Wednesday Biden led Sanders by 1,153 pledged delegates to 874. Even before Tuesday, Sanders would have to have won the lion’s share of delegates in coming contests.The Biden campaign has been hesitant to declare victory outright but has argued publicly and behind the scenes that Biden’s delegate advantage is unassailable.In a conference call with donors ahead of the Tuesday’s primary results, Greg Schultz, a top adviser for the campaign, said the Biden team felt they had a “very clear delegate trajectory that would require Sanders to so overwhelmingly out-perform” in the next few primary contests, according to audio obtained by the .On Wednesday morning, Unite the Country, a Super Pac supporting Biden, released a memo going even further.“Last night’s overwhelming victories in Arizona, Illinois and Florida are likely to add at least 150 delegates to Joe Biden’s already commanding delegate lead. Even without Ohio voting, Joe Biden effectively ended the race last night,” the memo said.“He will be the Democratic nominee, and for Unite the Country, the focus now turns to November. The turnout generated by the vice-president continues to surprise everyone. Despite the virus, total turnout in Arizona and Florida exceeded 2016 numbers, and just like in previous states this primary season, there was particularly robust turnout in the types of suburban communities where we need to show strength this fall.”More concerning for Sanders and his progressive movement within the primary contest are the limitations the coronavirus outbreak is putting on the campaign. Because of the pandemic, Sanders’ campaign cannot hold the energetic rallies that are a pillar of the campaign, Democratic strategist Julian Mulvey, who advised Sanders in 2016, said.“Part of the difficult challenge now is they can’t hold rallies. The rallies have always been, in one sense, the central part of the campaign,” Mulvey said. “It’s direct connection with Bernie and the grassroots and people. It’s him getting on the ground, delivering his 90-minute stump speech – delivering his giant stump speech. I think it’s very important for the energy on the ground, it’s very important for Bernie.”But Sanders allies and strategists from the progressive wing of the party still see value in the Vermont senator continuing the campaign.“In this moment of national crisis, Bernie’s platform is more salient than ever: Republicans and centrist Democrats alike are suddenly echoing his calls for free healthcare, expanded paid sick leave, and unemployment insurance,” progressive Democratic strategist Monica Klein said in an email to the  on Wednesday.She added: “We’ve seen from exit polls that Bernie’s economic and healthcare platforms are widely supported by Democratic voters – so whoever we end up with as our nominee, the Democratic ticket needs to embrace the bold economic solutions that Bernie has championed since day one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0d91c199ba69af390f41b5bf4fe346d895682c8/0_93_2218_1330/master/2218.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c431388d5929ee31973a443e98ed24ed","title":"what a coronavirus lockdown might mean for london","story":"How countries from China to Italy have imposed measures to curb the spread of Covid-19When China announced plans to lock down Wuhan and most of the surrounding Hubei province, the news was greeted with astonishment around the world. Experts warned that it was an unprecedented and risky attempt to control the virus that might not work.Nearly two months later, with the daily number of new cases in China down to single digits last week, Wuhan is starting to emerge from two months of isolation, and this approach has become the model for other countries with outbreaks that appear to be sliding out of control.Now there is speculation the British government is preparing to implement something similar in London, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in Britain.Other countries appear to have suppressed or contained the disease without such stringent measures, including Taiwan and Singapore, but they acted early and fast on other measures including testing, contact tracing and social distancing.On 23 January China locked down Wuhan city, home to 11 million people, where Covid-19 is thought to have originated. It was probably the most extreme lockdown so far and at the time it was brought in the move was met with some international scepticism, including from the World Health Organization.No journeys were allowed in or out of the city, even for those with compelling medical or humanitarian reasons.Inside the city, public transport was suspended and private cars barred from the roads in most circumstances, except as part of the fight against the virus.Most people live in residential blocks or compounds, and management barred visits. Only inhabitants, authorities, or people providing help to elderly or disabled were allowed in.Schools and universities were already closed for the lunar new year holiday but that was extended. Most shops were closed only pharmacies and supermarkets remained open.People were only allowed to leave their homes to get essential supplies or seek medical help, and anyone who did go out was required to wear a mask.Two weeks later conditions were tightened, with authorities ordering house-to-house searches for potentially infected iniduals, and forcing them into quarantine.Some restrictions have been lifted, allowing residents in key industries to start returning to work, but schools remain closed and curbs on transport are still in place.On 8 March Italy shut down the northern region that was most severely affected by the virus two days later it extended the controls to the entire country.Travel is only allowed for “urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies or health reasons”.People who have tested positive for Covid-19 must not leave their homes for any reason, while anyone with a fever or respiratory symptoms is strongly encouraged to stay at home and limit social contact, including with their doctor.To avoid work-related travel, public and private companies have been urged to put their staff on leave.Supermarkets and pharmacies remain open, but little else.Schools and universities are closed, and all exams cancelled. Religious institutions will stay open, as long as people can stay a metre from one another – but ceremonies such as marriages, baptisms and funerals are banned.All gatherings “in public places” have been banned, not just large-scale events. All museums and cultural venues are closed, as well as nightclubs, cinemas, theatres and casinos.Sporting events were cancelled. Swimming pools, spas, sports halls and ski resorts across the country are shut.France’s full lockdown began at midday on Tuesday. People are barred from leaving home except to buy food or essentials, visit the doctor or get to a job certified as not doable from home.They have to carry a special document, certifying why they are outside, to show to security forces.About 100,000 police officers have been deployed to enforce the lockdown, with checkpoints to be set up nationwide.These are the toughest restrictions on public life outside wartime, and the president, Emmanuel Macron, described the battle against coronavirus as a “public health war … against an invisible and elusive enemy. There can be no more outside meetings, no more seeing family or friends on the street or in the park.”France had already closed all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops from midnight on Saturday and creches, schools and universities from Monday morning.After crowds continued to gather outside, Paris closed all its parks and gardens.San Francisco and five other Bay Area counties in California ordered all residents to “shelter in place” to curb the spread of coronavirus, the first lockdown of its kind in the US.Effective until 7 April, it is a voluntary order, directing residents to stay inside unless absolutely necessary – in contrast with legally binding restrictions elsewhere.All businesses considered non-essential – such as bars and gyms – were ordered to close, and their workers to work from home. But grocery stores, pharmacies, launderettes, restaurants serving takeaway, petrol stations and other “essential businesses” will remain open, and municipal services such as rubbish collection will continue.Residents can leave their home for essential tasks, exercise and care duties, but have been asked to keep six feet away from other people.All non-essential gatherings of any size are prohibited, as well as non-essential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit”.Airports, taxis and public transport will continue running, but only for essential travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ceab034de320078d26a40c04cb5dcb72441be5/0_87_3366_2019/master/3366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641177ba66ae13a7f1e0b32e4202987c","title":"afro mexicans census history identity","story":"The Afro-Mexican population are often overlooked in Mexico’s cultural mosaic, but this year marks a statistical firstWhen Bulmaro García encounters military checkpoints in Mexico’s southern Guerrero state, soldiers sometimes ask him to sing the national anthem to prove his nationality.García, a black man from the remote Costa Chica region, always refuses, and instead schools the soldiers – usually from other parts of Mexico – in local history.“We exist. We’re here. We occupy this area. We have a culture and we proudly say that we’re Mexicans,” he said.The Afro-Mexican population has long struggled for recognition in an overwhelmingly mestizo country where the indigenous past is lionized but lighter skin colour is often reflected in social advancement and higher incomes.This year’s census – which is being collected throughout March – marks the first time the country is counting its Afro-Mexican population, providing official recognition for a people often overlooked in the Mexican cultural mosaic.A 2015 survey from Mexico’s statistics institute estimated the Afro-Mexican population at 1.3 million. Observers expect the census to put the current total at around 2 million – mostly in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Veracruz states.“It’s extremely important that they count us as Afro-Mexicans,” said García, an engineer in the community of Cuajinicuilapa. “We’re of African descent – but we’re Mexicans because we were born here and we built this country.”From the very start of conquest of what is now Mexico, Africans arrived alongside the Spanish, both voluntarily as conquistadores – and as slaves.Many intermarried with indigenous people and some Afro-Mexicans have played prominent roles in the country’s history – including the independence hero José María Morelos and early president Vicente Guerrero.More recently, however, their history has been one of marginalisation and neglect in underdeveloped regions such as the Costa Chica, a dry, tropical zone to the south-east of Acapulco.When President Andrés Manuel López Obrador visited the region recently, a local politician complained of inadequate roads, a lack of hospitals and schools and recurring blackouts.“Our history was erased for centuries, so people think we don’t exist,” Abad Campos Rodríguez told the president.Locals say the struggle for recognition started to gain momentum ahead of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival in the Americas.Indigenous groups saw nothing to celebrate – and García said many Afro-Mexican communities felt the same since “we, too were mistreated by the Spanish because they brought us here by force.“We knew we were different from the indigenous people, and we were different from mestizos – so we started to struggle for recognition.”Many Afro-Mexican communities have “leaned into” their identity for social and cultural reasons, said Jayson M Porter, a PhD candidate in environmental history at Northwestern University, who has studied the Costa Chica.“The question is: how much they should lean in to their identity for political reasons?” he said, adding that it is unclear who counts as Afro-Mexican – and what benefits that will bring.Afro-Mexican identity is not straightforward: many self-identify as negro (black) though others dislike the term and prefer Afro-Mexican or Afro-descendant.“There are people who say they don’t mind being called negro – but it depends on how they say it,” says Yolanda Camacho, a member of the Colectiva de la Costa de Oaxaca Ñaa ‘Tunda – with ñaa ‘tunda meaning “black woman” in the Mixtec language.“In the word ‘Afro-Mexican’ are all the names of self-descriptions that we give ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8fe44e1fc940fd14c3205aac748dc16b30fee8f/0_3_2555_1534/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03431a6120ad6d1b2365afae3ab4d684","title":"calls for uk basic income payment to cushion coronavirus impact","story":"MPs, peers and others say the money for all citizens would help them through crisisThe government is facing cross-party calls from MPs, charities and thinktanks to start paying swathes of the population a basic income to cushion the economic shock of the coronavirus outbreak.The former Conservative business secretary Greg Clark urged the government to act immediately to prevent mass job losses by allowing the taxpayer to subsidise companies’ wage bills. Forty-six opposition MPs and peers also wrote to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak demanding a basic income payment for all citizens to see them through this crisis.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Citizens Advice proposed a “crisis minimum income” of at least £180 a week so everyone has enough money “to protect their own health and the health of others”, and economists at the Resolution Foundation thinktank called for the government to pay two-thirds of wages if employees are left without work to do, at a cost of £8bn for a million workers over six months.Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Germany are among the European countries which have already taken action to shore up workers’ incomes directly.Clark, who resigned as business secretary rather than serve under Boris Johnson, raised an urgent question in the House of Commons. He said the £330bn loan scheme the chancellor announced on Tuesday would not prevent firms from sacking their staff.“These businesses have no idea when they would be able to pay back the debt that they would incur. It provides no reason to keep staff employed. In fact the reverse, because the smaller the wage bill, the less would have to be borrowed,” he said.He pointed out instead that HMRC already knew the wage bill of all companies that pay their workers through the PAYE system. “That flow should now be reversed, with the nation paying the wages of people for the next few weeks, if and only if they continue to employ their staff,” he said.“If the government does not act immediately, large numbers of people will be unemployed. Registering them will put huge pressure on the welfare system. Vital skills will be lost, and good businesses will cease trading.”The junior Treasury minister, John Glen, replied by repeated the mantra that the government was ready to do “whatever it takes” to deal with the crisis.He said the chancellor was holding discussions with unions and business groups on Thursday and “this will be with a view to urgently developing new forms of employment support to help support peoples jobs and incomes.”Sunak made clear on Tuesday that his preference was for such a scheme, which could operate through employers, rather than the creation of an entirely new system such as universal basic income, though the prime minister said on Wednesday that had not been ruled out.Citizens Advice said single-person households needed £960 a month to avoid getting into difficulty, and a couple with children £1,700. Millions stand to lose earnings as a result of social distancing measures. The charity predicted people would typically be spending £27 less a week on transport and £19 less on leisure, but that food and energy bills would rise.“The government must set a crisis minimum income of at least £180 a week so that people can afford the basics while they are unable to work,” said Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. “Increasing sick pay and support from the benefits system will mean people don’t have to face the impossible choice of working while unwell or ignoring guidance to self-isolate or socially distance.”Opposition MPs and peers calling for the introduction of a minimum basic income included Jon Cruddas, Lord Dubs and Chris Bryant for Labour, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, 33 of the Scottish National Party’s Westminster parliamentarians and representatives of Plaid Cymru.The Resolution Foundation said that with less than one-in-ten of those in the bottom half of earners saying they were able work from home, it would be harder for them to protect their incomes in the face of social distancing measures.It also proposes that the 2 million lowest-earning employees currently ineligible for statutory sick pay are granted the benefit and that it be increased for everyone from £95.85 to £160 a week to ensure it covered half the earnings of employees that rely on it, up from the current third. The government should meet £800m cost of the increase over six months for small and medium-sized businesses, it said. The foundation also said ministers should increase the basic out-of-work universal credit payment by a third to £100.In Ireland, employers who have to temporarily shut businesses have been asked to continue paying staff €203 a week, again reimbursed by the government. Sick pay will also rise to €305 a week and will be available for those asked to self-isolate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057ccb905652fc199bbe89ddd264a1f166cbd876/0_122_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e365851c8fd3db801be5a1c9b9cd5f3","title":"coronavirus symptoms should i see doctor cough covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms as experiencing either:No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk cases how many in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 across the United Kingdom.

While schools will close from Friday, Britain has yet to bring in mandatory social-distancing measures, with people urged – but not ordered – to avoid “non-essential contact”.Similar Italian measures introduced earlier this month “must be extended beyond their original deadline”, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told the Corriere della Sera on Thursday. At present, people may leave home only for justified work or medical reasons until 3 April, while most shops are closed until 25 March.Conte added that “if the prohibitions are not respected, we will have to act again”. Ministers had earlier said the rules may be may tightened to include a complete ban on all outdoor activities, including exercise, after 47,000 people across the country were fined in one week for going out “without good reason”.Italy, the European country worst hit by the pandemic, has reported more than 35,000 infections and nearly 3,000 deaths, including a record daily high of 475 on Wednesday. An army spokesman confirmed on Thursday that soldiers had removed bodies from the northern town of Bergamo, where funeral services are overwhelmed.There are nearly 221,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, and 8,957 people have died.In Germany, where non-essential shops have been shut, public gatherings cancelled and citizens advised to stay at home as much as possible, authorities were considering imposing mandatory lockdowns after the chancellor, Angela Merkel, called the epidemic the country’s “biggest challenge since the second world war”.Concerns are mounting in Berlin, Bavaria and other states that people are continuing to socialise outside. “If people do not voluntarily follow restrictions, the only measure that remains is a state-wide confinement in order to react to that. Everybody needs to realise that,” the Bavarian state premier, Markus Söder, said on Thursday.The mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller, said he was appalled by the lack of consideration many Berliners were showing. “People do not understand. It is unacceptable that people are actually inviting each other to corona parties. It is terrible!” he said.Germany, which has reported 12,853 cases and 34 deaths, is also considering tracking mobile phone data to check whether Germans are sufficiently reducing their movements. Deutsche Telekom has given the go-ahead to anonymous data use for the project, which has yet to secure government approval.In Spain, which has reported 12,000 cases and nearly 500 deaths, alarm is increasing at the spread of the virus in the country’s care homes. The death toll in care homes in the Madrid region has exceeded 50, authorities said, while as many as 25 outbreaks have been confirmed in care homes in the Castilla La Mancha region.The Spanish army has begun producing hand-sanitiser, the company that owns Zara has said it will use its facilities to start sewing hospital gowns, and small clothing manufactures are making masks, while two vacant hotels in Madrid are being turned into makeshift hospitals.As economies across the continent went into nosee, the European Central Bank on Wednesday night announced a €750bn economic stimulus programme lasting until the end of 2020. “Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,” the bank’s chief, Christine Lagarde, said.The European commission said it aims to build a €50m (£46m) stockpile of masks, protective clothing and ventilators to help EU countries facing shortages of vital medical kit. The move comes after commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said China had offered to send Europe 2m surgical masks and 50,000 testing kits.Von der Leyen said the EU had sent China 50,000 tonnes of protective equipment in January, adding that the union was “very grateful” for Beijing’s help.In other developments:In the US, Donald Trump, describing himself as himself a wartime president, invoked rarely used emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against the epidemic and signed an aid package guaranteeing sick leave to workers who fall ill.Meanwhile, China, where the virus originated, on Thursday reported no new cases of Covid-19 acquired inside the country for the first time, but announced a rise in the number of infections from abroad.Beijing recorded 21 new infections from abroad, mostly in travellers from Britain and Spain. The capital has halted self-quarantine for travellers arriving from abroad, authorities said on Thursday, with non-transit travellers sent to designated sites for a compulsory 14-day quarantine.If no more cases are reported in Wuhan, the centre of the global outbreak, for 14 consecutive days, the city’s lockdown – in place since 23 January – could be lifted, local media said. Quarantine rules have already been slightly eased, allowing people to work in their compounds rather than staying confined to living quarters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa245abf8cf3f37c1bfad8256ab9da0924a0ee3/0_138_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00dfb3f14a98e23ac5b9d61c4bd94eaa","title":"not talking to people is difficult self isolators share their stories coronavirus","story":"Four people who are self-isolating due to illness tell us what to expect and how to copeWith the UK government announcing that those with coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate, four people who have already been at home for some time share their experiences.Sheila O’Neill, the managing director of a provider of specialist services for people with learning difficulties and autism, has been self-isolating for over a week. “I started social distancing three weeks ago because I felt unwell and because of my age,” said the 73-year-old. “I’ve been staying inside watching the sheep.”O’Neill, who founded City Care Partnership, developed a severe cough two weeks ago. After a phone consultation with her GP she was diagnosed with a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics.She began self-isolation last Monday in Manchester, where she lives, but moved to her cottage in Wales on Sunday. “I’m one of the fortunate ones,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation for elderly people. The majority of us live productive lives and hope that society will take care of us when we are older, but we appear to have been abandoned by the health service and the government.“I’ve finished the course of antibiotics and now I just hope it goes. I’ve been putting Vicks on my chest and taking menthols. I’m quite determined.”O’Neill has been trying to support the people she works with from home. “We offer a lot of activities like horse riding, crafts, etc. Some of those won’t be possible now but we are trying to find ways to deliver other services using video.“I’ve been reading a lot and am nearly caught up with the programmes I’ve missed. At the moment I’m watching Hidden. I have three children and eight grandchildren and I’m actually trying to stop the social contact. When they all try and call it’s the end of the day before I know it.”John, who works as a bicycle courier in Manchester, decided to self-isolate on Saturday after waking up with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. “I wanted to be cautious as my job involves visiting people who might be vulnerable to coronavirus.“I messaged the supply company and they disabled my account for seven days, so I’m unable to work,” said the 24-year-old. “This wouldn’t normally be a problem but they have funds available for people who have coronavirus, but they’re not available unless you get medically tested.”As people were not getting tested for the virus unless they had been admitted to hospital John feared some people in the gig economy may not have access to the funds they need. “It makes sense as it prevents fraud but it’s a very difficult time,” he said.John said he reduces social isolation by talking to people all day on platforms such as Discord, where gaming communities can chat and share their screens while playing. “Not talking to real people can be difficult because you struggle to validate whether your thoughts are valid,” he said. “Hearing people’s voices makes you feel human and it’s a good way of trying to maintain social connections without social contact.“I live alone and one problem is that I don’t tend to remember what day it is. We’re so used to doing things that define our time off work that being at home means not having that shared experience.“I’m anticipating going back to work soon though, as people need food delivered, and there could be someone who is reliant on me.”Rosie,* who works in an office in London, has been in self-isolation for over a week. “I filled in the 111 questionnaire online and it advised me to call my GP,” she said. “I could only get through to a receptionist who advised me to go to the pharmacy, which I didn’t think was a good idea because I had a sore throat and was coughing.“I’m lucky enough to get two weeks’ sick leave from my workplace and my colleagues are supportive and understanding,” said the 37-year-old who is at home with her husband, who works in finance in IT. “My husband’s employer has been pushing for me to get tested but I can’t.”Rosie has been too unwell to do anything but rest at home. “I don’t need to think about how to pass the time as I’m actually sick. I feel tired and weak so I don’t want to do anything. Passing the time is not a big problem.”Andrew Moscrop, 42, works as a GP in Oxford, and has been in self-isolation since Friday after his temperature rose to 38.6C. “My fever resolved over the weekend,” he said. “Any other time I would go back to work as normal, but I can’t.”Moscrop contacted 111, Public Health England, the local health protection agency and the John Radcliffe hospital in the hope of being tested. “The advice was the same. Stay at home. It’s quite frustrating as at the end of the day you just want to do your job.“We are facing an escalating caseload and the government has talked of drafting in retired clinicians. Surely we should be testing frontline health workers so that, if negative, they can return to work promptly after an illness?”Moscrop’s partner, who also works in the health service, has also had to self-isolate along with their young child. “It’s become a bigger issue than we thought,” he said. “The government’s advice doesn’t seem entirely thought through as there’s nothing to say this won’t happen again later down the line.“We need to remain fairly pragmatic about it. We’re surrounded by fields so I took the little one out for a walk and a breath of fresh air. Soon I’ll have to pop out for food. I won’t wear a mask but I’ll just nip in as quickly as possible and use self-checkouts. My partner looked at getting food delivered but the available dates were quite far into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94c85dd0702c42564355691585178fb2606ec778/155_822_2489_1494/master/2489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96d9ee5ac4882e79a009457e461e3ac6","title":"pakistan coronavirus camp no facilities no humanity","story":"More than 1,000 remain there as thousands more are released into impoverished BalochistanIt was the smell that was the worst. In this dusty camp on Pakistan’s border with Iran, which at one stage held over 6,000 people, the stench of sweat, rubbish and human excrement hung in the air. There was no real housing, just five people to a ragged tent, and no bathrooms, towels or blankets.The camp, in the town of Taftan in Balochistan province, was supposed to function as a sanitary quarantine location, preventing the spread of the coronavirus from Iran, which has had one of the worst outbreaks globally.Instead, according to Mohammed Bakir, who was held there for two weeks, it was no more than “a prison … the dirtiest place I have ever stayed in my life”.“These were the hardest days and nights of my life,” said Bakir. “ We were treated like animals. There were no facilities but also no humanity and everything was disarray. They were not prepared, there was nothing for us to sleep in except some dilapidated tents.”Thousands of people have been kept in close quarters in hot, squalid conditions in Taftan, with not even basic precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. According to doctors at the camp, even those who presented with symptoms were not tested or even isolated, and there was a severe shortage of doctors and nurses. There was such a lack of medical facilities, the few doctors on site took to paying for necessary medicines themselves. Things got so bad that protests broke out among those quarantined.“There were patients with diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases who were quarantined for 14 days without any proper medication. Their conditions were really bad there and they were treated like animals.”The border between Pakistan and Iran runs over 600 miles and movement between the two countries is extremely common, especially among minority Shia Muslims in Pakistan who cross over to Iran for religious pilgrimages. It is also a crucial trade route. But over the past two weeks, it has become a hotbed of coronavirus, with infections going up by the dozen every day. Currently there are 302 reported cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, the highest number of cases in south Asia.Even though infections in Iran began to rise rapidly weeks ago, the Pakistan government only officially shut the border less than a week ago. The border is also still porous on Tuesday night at least 100 pilgrims crossed over from Iran into Balochistan, reportedly after bribing border guards.Among those held in Taftan was Abid Hussain, who is from Nagar in Gilgit-Baltistan, and was quarantined for two weeks after returning from Iran. “It’s like I have been released from prison,” said Hussain. “They call it a quarantine but we didn’t get hand wash, face masks and any other sanitary facilities. The only check was that in the morning a doctor used to come round taking everyone’s temperature. That was it for 13 days. Everyone was desperate to leave.” Many of those in Taftan have been released or transferred to other facilities, but 1,200 still remain.Hussain also described lax regulations on movement for those in the camp, with many going to shops in the town, walking around the vicinity and having regular social group gatherings. No guidelines were issued for how those in quarantine could protect themselves from getting the disease, and there was no running water for people to wash their hands.Local vendors from the nearby town were also allowed to enter the camp and set up shop every day, selling food to the thousands in quarantine without gloves or masks before returning back to their families. “Around these fruit stalls it was more like a scene from a busy Friday bazaar than a quarantine camp in lockdown,” said one eyewitness.The situation was equally bad in the hospitals in Balochistan, the least developed and most impoverished province of Pakistan, which were tasked with dealing with the outbreak. A doctor at one hospital in Quetta claimed that medical staff had refused to treat or even examine a young girl with all the symptoms of coronavirus, whose father had recently returned from China for work. The girl reportedly died days later without being tested.Pakistan’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak, said the doctor, was “depressing and disturbing”.Pakistan has a notoriously bad track record for containing disease outbreaks, and is one of only two countries in the world that have failed to eliminate polio. The government’s fear of a coronavirus outbreak meant it even refused to evacuate the 600 Pakistani students stranded in Wuhan province in China, where the pandemic began."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b431e69cb7df7854984025620445b262c5c7b22a/0_176_5221_3133/master/5221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f3b0deffaac5494a9b89956aef5c2d","title":"teachers share your tips for working at home","story":"We would like to hear from teachers about the things they do to help them work efficiently at homeMost pupils in the UK will remain at home from Friday with schools in England only staying open to supervise vulnerable children and those of key workers.If you are a teacher we would like to hear your suggestions and advice for how parents and carers should teach children at home.What apps and platforms are you using to teach from home?

He said he had asked for daily updates on the numbers working at the call centre to bring waiting times down.Pressed on whether British people were being charged £1.80 a minute waiting to get through to the call centre, he said that was a new figure to him. He said in some countries staff had been unable to reach their embassy, given the advice issued to FCO staff on self-isolation.He said specific repatriation problems were focused in Morocco, Peru and Vietnam, adding he was working with other countries to see if special flights could be commissioned to bring British nationals home.He said the UK was working with host countries to help stranded British nationals and even asking airlines to send planes to destinations to where they might not ordinarily fly. He denied claims the British embassy in Lima was in effect closed, but said at present no flights were leaving the country.Raab said: “We are striving every sinew in these less accessible routes to do everything we can.”Foreign affairs select committee member Royston Smith said he had seen emails suggesting one airline, Avianca, was willing to offer flights back from Lima to Europe at a cost of $3,500 (£3,000 ) per passenger.The embassy in Kuwait on Twitter has advised: “If you are stuck in Kuwait and you don’t have enough money, please seek assistance through friendsfamily or local charities in Kuwait like Bait Alzakat or Salvation Army.”Raab said there there were no plans to change the UK government’s travel advice at this stage. This leaves the UK in a more liberal position than the EU Schengen countries that have closed their external borders completely.He said: “If we introduced these measures it would have knock-on effects,” adding the UK was at a different epidemiological stage to some countries in Europe. Raab insisted the UK was actively cooperating at G7 and G20 levelsbut admitted there were differences in national approaches.He said he could not give a “cast-iron guarantee” that Cop26, the pivotal UN climate change conference scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November would go ahead, saying it depended on the trajectory of the virus. “We would want it to go ahead,” he said, adding the coronavirus had shown the need to step up to the plate on some of these global challenges.He said: “It’s even possible as of today it might be doable, but we face a greater challenge in pulling it off.”He said 114 countries had promised to present more plans on emissions at the conference.The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, suggested a bold postponement of a year might be necessary given the energy all countries were applying to fighting the virus.He revealed that he had tried to hold the select committee session by video conference, but had been told it was not permissible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44574f1d8380651dcf46161f63e109108c426ab9/0_155_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae8e7221e61f8777151825425106dda","title":"zero prospect of london lockdown involving movement limits says no 10","story":"Government seeks to quash reports of strict lockdown but says pubs and cafes could face new measuresThere is “zero prospect” of a London lockdown involving limits on movement but new restrictions could be put in place on pubs and cafes to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the capital, the government has said.The prime minister’s official spokesperson sought to quash overnight reports that there would be limits on transport or on who can enter or leave London, saying there was also no truth to reports that key workers would be asked to present papers to prove their status.But with people still being asked to avoid congregating in public, details of new steps to slow the virus in London – where it is spreading faster than anywhere else in the UK – are expected to be released later and are likely to include new conditions on pubs, cafes, bars and theatres.The spokesperson said: “There are no plans to close down the transport network in London and there is zero prospect of any restriction being placed on travelling in or out of London. The prime minister and his advisers have set out the need for social distancing measures to limit the spread of the virus and to protect lives.“What we’re focused on is ensuring as many people as possible take that advice and don’t unnecessarily put themselves in a position where they could be spreading coronavirus.”He said speculation that households could be limited to only one person at a time leaving their home were untrue and he dismissed claims that people could be fined if they left their homes.Sweeping changes to ordinary life in the capital are already in place, with Transport for London announcing on Wednesday night that it was closing 40 tube stations that are not interchange hubs. A reduced service is expected on the underground and buses.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said it was critical that far fewer people used the transport network but it was not a complete shutdown. He said tougher measures including bans might be needed and curtailing civil liberties was necessary to save lives.Speaking on Thursday morning to the London assembly, Khan was asked if tougher measures and bans were coming. He said: “The most important human right is the one to live. It’s actually article two of the Human Rights Act. And so sometimes our liberties and human rights need to be changed, curtailed, infringed – use whatever word you want – for reasons that are sensible, justifiable. A key thing is for it to be proportionate.”Khan said no one wanted to order sweeping and unprecedented measures such as closing schools. “But these are extraordinary times. It’s very important we understand the consequence of people’s liberties and human rights not being deprived or curtailed, suspended, is lives being lost.”Khan, a former human rights lawyer, was critical of what he said was ambiguous information being released by the government, and said bans might be needed to stop people gathering in bars and restaurants. “We are not there yet,” he said. “The advice from the government is just advice. I think that provides a mixed message. It’s clearly not been clear enough. We may move to a situation where we move from advice to bans.”Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

Photograph: Nick BradshawUniversity College Dublin (UCD) has said it will extend leases for any student living in on-campus accommodation “unable to return to their normal place of residence” in May, due to coronavirus overseas travel restrictions. The university has also said students living in private rental accommodation outside of the south Dublin campus who lose their housing amid the coronavirus crisis can apply for on-campus accommodation.In an email to students on Thursday, UCD registrar Prof Mark Rogers said the university “will honour the rental agreements for all students who wish to remain on campus and encourage students to remain resident”.The decision contrasts with a move by Trinity College Dublin at the start of this week to order all students living in the university’s student accommodation to vacate their rooms. In an email late on Monday, Trinity College said students had to leave their rooms within 24 hours, with overseas students given two days’ notice to leave their accommodation. The university said it would make exceptions for students who would face homelessness, were subject to visa or travel restrictions, or had a family member at home with the virus, or one who was immunocompromised. The university’s initial message also covered two private student accommodation providers the college partners with, Kavanagh Court and Binary Hub. However, the college later backtracked to clarify as it did not manage that accommodation, the instruction to leave was “strong advice” rather than a “requirement” for students living there. Trinity College said it had no choice but to attempt to clear its student accommodation due to the spread of the virus, also known as Covid-19. Online learningLast week, the Government ordered colleges and schools to close for two weeks in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. Following the closure of campuses across the country colleges have switched to online learning. In the recent email to UCD students, Prof Rogers said students who wanted to leave on-campus accommodation and return home would be refunded the rent they had paid for the remainder of the term. “Residents who are advised to self-isolate by the HSE will be moved to specific housing to allow them to be supported by the university,” he said. Students living outside of the campus “who face housing problems because of Covid-19, eg if a landlord requires the property, may now apply for on-campus accommodation,” the email said. Lease agreements “will be extended should students be unable to return to their normal place of residence at the end of their current agreement due to Covid-19 travel restrictions,” it said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"home tuition our guide to the best teaching and learning resources online","story":"Two weeks.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A further 74 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Wednesday night. The new cases involve 29 women and 45 men. The total number of cases in the Republic is now 366.It also published an analysis of the first 271 cases. Of these, 40 per cent involved men and 59 per cent are female, with 23 clusters.To date 42 per cent of cases are travel-related 22 per cent are associated with community transmission 17 per cent are as a result of local transmission and 20 per cent remain under investigation.Two-thirds of cases were among people aged under 55 years, with almost one in four aged 35 to 55. One baby aged under one contracted the virus, but no children aged one to four years. There were four cases among children aged five to 14 years.One case in five involved a healthcare worker, and one-third of these cases were associated with travel.Dublin has the highest number of cases with 129, followed by Cork (48) and Limerick (14).The cases were also analysed by severity. Of the 271 cases, 84 (31 per cent) saw the patient hospitalised this figure is artificially high because at the start of the outbreak all patients were sent to hospital, even if their symptoms were mild.Six patients have required treatment in intensive care this is 2 per cent of the overall number. There have been two confirmed deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 0.7 per cent.Leitrim, Laois and Monaghan were the only counties not to record a case, while 15 other counties recorded fewer than five cases.ComplianceThere has been an “extraordinary level of compliance” with the social distancing measures introduced last week, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan told a media briefing. People were showing a “high degree of understanding” in relation to symptoms, and the importance of self-isolation for people showing symptoms.“You see it every day,” Dr Holohan said, adding that he had counted just 11 passengers on six buses on his way to work.He said as the measures have taken effect, public health doctors have started to notice that the number of contacts of confirmed cases has grown smaller.However, he said it was too early to know if the measures were having the desired impact, and it might be “towards the end of the month” before this would be known.He said the Taoiseach’s prediction of 15,000 cases by the end of the month represented an “unmitigated situation”, and he was hopeful a lower number of cases would be observed as a result of the measures taken.Asked about reports online of a third death from the disease on Wednesday, Mr Holohan said he did not have any notification of this but it can take time for cases to “come through” in processing.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news:  Coronavirus Bill published as government seeks power to force isolationsCoronavirus latest news: Death toll in England rises to 128, as Government publishes Coronavirus Bill How the Spring Equinox marks the changing seasonsComment: Let loose our small businesses: they can rescue our economy from coronavirus Army redeploys troops home from Iraq as Coronavirus forces end to training missionHow does coronavirus compare to flu, Sars, and other diseases?UK coronavirus lockdown plans: What the Government advice means for youComment: Coronavirus has succeeded where the Luftwaffe failed by battering MPs into submissionCoronavirus school closures: when will they close in England, Wales and Scotland - and what does it mean for parents?Coronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? Where in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?Where in London have coronavirus cases been detected?Can I take ibuprofen to treat coronavirus symptoms?

I like being in the action in a crisis.The chef is also delivering meals to families in Anglesey from his restaurant, including sausage casseroles and roasted meat and fish.Cooking with sparse ingredients could be an opportunity, he said, adding: If you are needing to self isolate and whatnot you can have a bit of fun while you\u0027re doing it, thinking about the food you\u0027re going to eat it gives you something to aim for, you can get your family involvedI\u0027ve noted lots of small suppliers we should be supporting are putting out deliveries selling fresh veg so we shouldn\u0027t be just sticking to tins.Many have asked him for quick recipes, Mr Barrie added, but said that the one thing self isolators have in bulk is time.He explained: People keep asking me for quick recipes but you\u0027re stuck in your house! Take your time, enjoy your cooking, learn to use a knife. Look on YouTube!Of course there\u0027s Ready Steady Cook on at half four every day which is perfect during this time.Many chefs have been using their skills to help the community as the country goes into quarantine.Roger Jones, who runs Michelin star restaurant The Harrow at Bedwyn has delayed his retirement to deliver free meals to the vulnerable in his community.He told The : Basically, people are cancelling the restaurant so we are using the food we would have served in the restaurant, it\u0027s Michelin starred food.We\u0027ve realised obviously in the months to come there will be a huge demand for supply so we are batch cooking food to put in our freezers and we will continue as long as we can to produce food.Mr Jones said the government should pay all pubs and restaurants in the country to become hubs to provide food to those who need it.He said he has put off his retirement because many elderly people do not qualify for free schemes but will need help throughout the quarantine.The chef explained: We\u0027re retiring after 21 years at the end of March but we will now continue to provide a service here throughout the summer. We own the property so we will continue to be here to be of service.It will become essential because if people can\u0027t get out to supermarkets, especially old people, and the meals on wheels is limited and doesn\u0027t cover the people who are more wealthy, as they can\u0027t get out and they don\u0027t qualify for anything. That means their savings are going. They may not be used to ordering food from Waitrose or Tesco, they\u0027ve always popped down to the local butcher and done their own thing.Another Twitter user said she had eggs, cocoa powder and flour. He replied: Weigh 4 eggs . Same weight flour and butter sugar . Add cocoa powder . Split between 2 baking tins 170 18 mins ish . Chocolate spongeChloe Ashdown has a tin of beans, a pork chop and some tortillas. The chef said: Spice your pork chop up and pan fry .. get the same spices into your beans and cook down . Whack a load of spinach spring onion and coriander into your curried beans . Sit pa- fried pork chop onto those naughty beans. And have the tortilla tomorrow.Gillian said she had tinned tomatoes, a potato and some kidney beans. He replied: Bake the back side off the spud .. chop an onion up garlic and ginger cook out with cumin and chilli, add your kidney beans and tomatoes with a beef stock cube. Cook down and down maybe put a small piece of dark dark choc in the sauce and You\u0027ll have a naughty chilli jacket!Christine Loy said: Broccoli, Jerusalem artichokes and salmon.  I have reasonable stores of basics.

This was no scenic jaunt, but a two-hour trek, taking in some of east London’s greatest eyesores – the Stalinist tower blocks of Stratford, the municipal horrors of Stepney Green, and Mile End in all its post-war finery. Not quite the daffodils of Ullswater, perhaps, but this was easily one of the most enjoyable walks of my life. After days cooped up indoors, even multistorey car parks take on a Wordsworthian hue.The march of coronavirus is life-inhibiting in so many ways. It has reframed our collective outlook, transforming previously “small” things like a haircut, walk in the park or drink with friends into longed-for pleasures. The sheer pace of change has left me overwhelmingly grateful for lingering signs of routine the reassuring sight of the bin men turning up on time, the quiet heroism of the tarmacers, shelf-stackers and street-sweepers going about their business as usual.Unable to visit them in person, many of us are showing renewed appreciation for our loved ones – though perhaps not those couples now forming uneasy collegial relationships over the kitchen table. Overnight, normally feckless twentysomethings have morphed into paragons of civic duty. Friends who habitually screen their mother’s phone calls are now dutifully checking in each night, and, in a disturbing reversal of adolescence, begging older relatives not to go out.Forbidden physical proximity, we find creative ways of showing affection. \u2028I won’t be making my usual trips home for Easter or Mothering Sunday, but we observed the latter early with a brief coffee at a safe distance last weekend, which took on a strangely ceremonial, almost festive quality. As I handed over my bottles of antibacterial hand gel, stashed away for elderly relatives, Mum reciprocated with a few rolls of lavatory paper and cartons of long-life milk. I predict tin-can stocking fillers if coronavirus isn’t over by Christmas.How wonderful that we can still speak to our friends whenever we like. WhatsApp groups provide a constant source of lame, often tasteless gags to keep our spirits up. For some of us, having the pub off-limits is the greatest privation of all but, undeterred, my friends are starting a new Saturday night ritual enjoying cocktail hour “together” via Skype – or “Sex and the City in hazmat suits”, as my housemate put it.At times of war, and this feels very much like one, we crave connections with the earth and nature. The Shire – the Hobbits’ rural idyll from The Lord of the Rings – was partly written in reaction to the “animal horror” of the Somme, which informed the landscapes of Tolkein’s Mordor. In the aftermath of the Second World War, sales of garden sheds soared, as returning servicemen sought a link with the soil and normality. As the weeks go by, I suspect the “man cave” – the spiritual descendant of the shed – will gain momentum. Allotments are heaving.Perhaps when this temporary nightmare is over, we will be left with a lasting appreciation of the mundane. Home cooking is back, as is the great outdoors. And at rock bottom, what we have always understood in our heart of hearts – that nothing tops the pleasure of knowing that our loved ones are safe and happy.You are not aloneThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Charities and unions want the government to do moreUnions and campaign groups have urged the government to do more to protect millions of tenants, businesses and workers from the impact of the coronavirus, as major gaps emerged in the chancellor’s £350bn economic rescue plans.Rishi Sunak unveiled an unprecedented package of government-backed business loans and grants – equivalent to 15 per cent of GDP – on Tuesday, but there was little evidence of help for some of the most vulnerable groups in society.Significant number of workers, particularly those in the gig economy or on flexible contracts, are likely to see a big drop in income. This risks compounding Britain’s problems by further reducing economic activity which has already been badly hit by social distancing measures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMany employees who self-isolate due to the coronavirus will have to get by on one of the lowest rates of statutory sick pay (SSP)\u0026nbspin Europe - just £94.25 per week. Only 30 per cent of employers pay more than the statutory minimum, according to the business secretary\u0026nbspAlok Sharma.What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsPressure is building on the government, with several unions, including Unite, calling for a large increase in the statutory sick pay rate.When questioned in the Commons on Wednesday, the prime minister refused to say whether he would follow other European countries in increasing SSP. However, he did say that no one would be penalised for staying at home to avoid catching or spreading Covid-19. Details of how he will meet this pledge have not yet been forthcoming.The chancellor said many more details of the government’s support plans will emerge after talks with company bosses and unions. Some key questions remain unanswered.Government action is required to protect millions of jobs that are at risk if economic activity declines as sharply as it is expected to. As people stay home and cut back on shopping, eating out and meeting up, certain sectors are feeling the brunt.\u0026nbspLay-offs and cuts to hours have already started in the hospitality sector which has warned many businesses will not be able to pay staff within weeks.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, ESA is just £73.10 per week, or £57.90 for people aged under 25. That is not enough for most\u0026nbsppeople to live on.Zero-hours contract workers can claim SSP if they earn\u0026nbspmore than £118 per week. If they earn less they may be able to claim unemployment benefits.Many gig economy workers are facing big declines in income as they are paid per job rather than a set wage. As less people go out, taxi drivers will earn much less, for example.Some gig economy firms such as Deliveroo have set up hardship funds for their riders but there are problems here too.Some riders have reported that they aren’t able to access the fund because they require a sick note, which they cant obtain because people with coronavirus symptoms or who are self-isolating are told not to go to the doctor.The government announced in the Budget last week that people could get confirmation of their illness through the NHS 111 helpline but Deliveroo says the government has not actually made this available yet, leaving some riders with no income and no access to the hardship fund.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain is demanding gig economy companies grant workers full sick pay without preconditions.Following sustained pressure from the Labour Party, the government announced emergency legislation on Wednesday\u0026nbspto ensure that renters are not evicted as a result of being unable to pay rent because of the pandemic.However, this still means people unable to work may fall into arrears through no fault of their own.\u0026nbspBenefit charity Turn2Us is calling for the government to increase universal credit payments to help cover rent costs while Jeremy Corbyn wants the government to suspend rent payments during the pandemic.Labour leadership candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey has called for a universal basic income – an unconditional payment made to every citizen – to help people, including renters.Given that the chancellor announced a three-month mortgage holiday for anyone struggling to make repayments because of Covid-19 he will remain under pressure to give renters equal leeway.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The value of sterling also slumped by some 4 per cent against the dollar on Wednesday.In a statement the Bank attributed this to investors seeking safety.“Over recent days, and in common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market have deteriorated as investors have sought\u0026nbsp shorter-dated instruments that are closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves,” it said.The statement added that the shock from the lockdown enforced by the Government to suppress the spread of Covid-19 would be “sharp and large, but should be temporary.Some analysts speculated whether the crisis could\u0026nbspforce the\u0026nbspBank to push\u0026nbspinterest rates into negative territory like the European Central Bank and Japan.“Britain is now a whisker away from the negative interest rate club. Rates have never been this low in the more than 300-year history of the Bank of England. Purchases of government and corporate bonds have been ramped up.

Seems to me a mistake.”He said: “However much we would like there to be a vaccine riding to the rescue in six months time. Currently, we think that\u0027s improbable. So now we\u0027ve got to work on a different theoretical framework for actually managing this epidemic.”Professor Whitty said normal public health responses to a disease, like those used to isolate ebola in West Africa were no longer likely to be effective against what was now a global pandemic virus.He said those tools such as containing and isolating infected people might work for some countries but the stage of the epidemic in the UK had gone beyond that position.He added that even if the UK could reduce infections it was almost inevitable the virus would return as it was a truly global infection.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several supermarkets are limiting the number of products customers can buy in stores to meet the demand amid the Covid-19 outbreak.Elsewhere, Donald Trump has crowned himself a “wartime president” fighting an invisible enemy, and has invoked rarely used emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against the pandemic. Mr Trump will also use\u0026nbsphis authority under the 70-year-old Defense Production Act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome a shortage in masks, ventilators and other supplies. The number of people infected worldwide has surpassed the 200,000 mark, according to the Johns Hopkins University, as deaths topped 8,700 – though the number of people considered recovered reached over 83,000.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollow the latest updatesEmergency legislation to be published in parliamentSchools to close, Army preparing to help out and police handed powers to arrest and isolateUp to 40 Tube stations to close across LondonSupermarkets limit number of products customers can buyUS Navy veteran released from prison in IranMichael White, 47, a US Navy veteran, has been released on medical furlough in Iran, as the country battles to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus,\u0026nbspBel Trew\u0026nbspreports.Mr White, who was arrested 2018 for an unspecified crime, is serving a 13-year sentence.His was released on humanitarian grounds on the condition he stayed in Iran, the State Department said on Thursday adding that he has been “wrongfully detained”.Mr White is now in the custody of the Swiss embassy and will undergo medical testing and evaluation, the statement added.The former serviceman was arrested in July 2018 while visiting his Iranian girlfriend, The New York Times reported. The Iranian authorities have never explained why he is being held.The US urged the Iranian government to immediately release on humanitarian grounds other US citizens behind bars including Morad Tahbaz, Baquer Namazi, and Siamak Namazi.\u0026nbsp“We also ask the regime to honour the commitment it made to work with the United States for the return of Robert Levinson,” who disappeared in 2007, the State Department communique read.Iran has temporarily freed about 85,000 people from jail, including political prisoners, in response to the coronavirus epidemic.Hardware shops should remain open, Green Party leader saysGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan called for hardware shops to remain open during the Covid-19 outbreak.How we maintain the mental health of our people is important and I recited an example the other day. How about we keep our hardware shops open? I know that is not the most important thing but if we keep our hardware shops open and if we have to work at home or be at home for a period we can get paint from the hardware shop.Or let\u0027s get every south-facing windowsill in this country. Let\u0027s plant our seeds in the next week so that if there is a supply crisis in food in a few months\u0027 time and when this gets really hard, we will have our salads ready to go.Suspected shoplifter arrested after coughing on staff and claiming to be infectedA man suspected of shoplifting has been arrested after coughing on store staff and claiming to be infected with Covid-19.West Midlands Police said a 57-year-old man was held on suspicion of theft and assault in Dudley on Thursday afternoon.Officers were called to Dudley High Street after several people reported a man coughing on shop staff who had suspected him of stealing.In a statement, a force spokesman said: The man, who is from Dudley and has suspected mental health issues, has been taken into custody and will be questioned in due course.Those affected have been given appropriate advice and referred to the non-emergency NHS helpline for further support and guidance.Additional ventilators orderedSome 40 additional mechanical ventilators (30 adult units and 10 paediatric units) have been ordered, which will bring the total available in Northern Ireland to 179 by the end of March.Plans are in place to rapidly increase the number of critical care beds.Key staff will be redeployed to coronavirus duties as non-urgent appointments and procedures are halted.Surgery for the treatment of cancer and other urgent procedures will continue.All health trusts will ensure patients who are medically well are safely and rapidly discharged from hospital, with appropriate care arrangements, to keep beds available for any increase in admissions.Routine GP work will be adjusted or suspended in the first number of weeks of the epidemic.Community pharmacies will endeavour to deliver an increased proportion of prescriptions, avoiding the need for people to travel to a community pharmacy.Services will be prioritised for those most in need, the vulnerable and those at risk of harm.This will include children\u0027s and young people, older people, mental health and learning disability services.England death toll increases by 29The UK death toll has increased\u0026nbspto 128, NHS England has announced.A further 29 people, who tested positive for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) have died, NHS England said.Patients were aged between 47 and 96 years old and had underlying health conditions.Brits most pessimistic about economy sine 2008 financial crisisPeople in Britain are at their most pessimistic about the outlook for the economy since the 2008 financial crisis because of the coronavirus pandemic, polling firm Ipsos MORI said.A poll of showed 69 per cent\u0026nbspof respondents thought the economy would get worse in the next 12 months, sharply up from 42 per cent\u0026nbspin February.Around half the public felt the government was handling the crisis well, although half were wanting more to be done, Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said.The poll of 1,003 people was conducted between 13 March and 16 March, before some of the most recent emergency measures were announced.Dutch confirm 409 new cases and 18 new deathsThe number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Netherlands has risen by 409 to a total of 2,460, Dutch health authorities said in their daily update, with 18 new deaths.The total death toll in the Netherlands now stands at 76, with victims ranging from 63 years to 95 years old.A total of 489 patients were or have been hospitalized, the Netherlands\u0027 National Institute for Health (RIVM) said in a statement.Logistical problem in distributing personal protective equipmentChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, said there was a logistical problem in distributing personal protective equipment to healthcare workers, but not a shortage, after a doctor likened the lack to soldiers inside Snatch Land Rovers in the Iraq war.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s World At One programme: We have obviously been talking to national NHS leaders and what they say to us is there are sufficient national stocks of personal protection equipment but there is currently a problem in terms of the logistical distribution of them.What\u0027s happened is that because of the sudden and understandable spike in demand it is taking a bit of time for the logistical distribution to catch up but the bit that they are saying to us is there are sufficient national stocks, the issue is actually ensuring that those stocks reach the frontline in the right numbers, in the right places, at the right time.His comments came after Dr Paul Evans, a GP in Gateshead, told the programme that frontline staff did not have PPE that inspires the confidence of the staff who would have to use it when seeing patients potentially affected by coronavirus 19.Dr Evans said: I would suggest that asking health professionals to see patients with a potentially lethal aerosol or airborne transmitted illness without adequate PPE draws an uncomfortable parallel with a decade or so ago sending soldiers to Afghanistan and Iraq in Snatch Land Rovers that were referred to by the troops at the time as mobile coffins.People can die \u0027directly and indirectly,\u0027 chief medical officer saysChief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty said people can die directly and indirectly during an epidemic.He said: People die in these epidemics... for two reasons.They die directly of the infection, unavoidably, best medical care, sadly this is still going to happen for some people.But also they can die because the health service they are in is overwhelmed and therefore there\u0027s an indirect death because there\u0027s a difference between what could happen with health and what we were able to provide in this situation.On reducing the peak of the infection, he added: It has an additional advantage, if you let an epidemic run its full course you get what\u0027s called overshoot where more people get infected than you would need if it were to run at a lower peak.Actually by lowering the peak you reduce the overall number of people who will get the infection.M\u0026ampS announces special shopping hoursMarks and Spencer has followed in the footsteps of other supermarkets and announced special shopping hours for NHS and emergency workers, as well as older and vulnerable customers.The first hour of trading tomorrow will be set aside for vulnerable customers, and from next week will happen every Monday and Thursday.Meanwhile, the first hour on Tuesdays and Fridays have been set aside for NHS staff and emergency workers.This does not include franchise stores in petrol and railway stations.Writing on Twitter, the company said: We ask our other customers to respect this request, as it\u0027s the kindness and support we show each other that will get us through this.Daytime TV sees viewing spikeDaytime TV shows - as well as news - have seen a spike in viewing.ITV

Ms Long Bailey\u0027s proposal is for the rate to be set at the living wage.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut Sir Iain, said his think-tank the Centre for Social Justice had ran the numbers and found that the cost would amount to an astronomic amount of money - with a basic payment costing the Treasury around £260 billion a year.He suggested that the delayed Universal Credit scheme, his main legacy at the DWP, would be a better alternative and was designed with just such critical moments in mind.Rebecca Long-Bailey calls for universal basic income during pandemicOne proposal being pushed around at the moment is the redundant idea of a Universal Basic Income, Sir Iain\u0026nbspwrote in an article for the  newspaper.Let me say now, it’s unaffordable, impractical, produces massive disincentives for people to work and most importantly won’t make any difference to poverty in this country.\u0026nbspAnd even if that weren’t enough, this would not be the moment for such a massive upheaval of our welfare system.Sir Iain said the taper rate of his own Universal Credit system should instead be lowered to pay more money to people who lose hours due to the pandemic and put a floor underneath employees as government steps in and takes the strain.Writing in  on Wednesday, the Shadow Business Secretary Ms Long-Bailey called for a fixed payment made to all, providing everyone with a basic minimum income of at least the real living wage, for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus fears lead to empty streets and shelves across UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The usually busy Royal Mile in Edinburgh is empty as people stay away from public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak on 13 MarchHo bart\u0027s Amusement Arcade in Westward Ho!, Devon is offering toilet roll and soap as prizes in grabber machinesAn empty platform at Farringdon Station in London the morning after the Prime Minister said that Covid-19 is the worst public health crisis for a generationShopkeepers Asiyah Javed and husband Jawad from Day Today Express, in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk are giving away facemasks, antibacterial hand wash and cleaning wipes to the elderly in a bid to stop the spread of CoronavirusA usually busy street in Cambridge is empty as people stay away from public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak on 2 MarchA hand sanitiser dispenser is seen inside the stadium during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Manchester City at Old Trafford on 8 MarchMaaya Indian Kitchen in Milton Keynes is offerig customers a free roll of toilet paper with every takeaway orderEmpty toilet paper shelves at a supermarket in London on 12 March A member of the public is swabbed at a drive through Coronavirus testing site set up in a car park in WolverhamptonA passenger wears a protective face mask as she travels on a bus in the City of LondonA Southampton fan wears a face mask before the match against Newcastle United on 7 MarchA loudspeaker placed in grounds of St Mary\u0027s Catholic Church in Broughattin, Dundalk, County Louth ahead of funeral mass later this morning.

The following morning\u0026nbspshe received a phone call asking more questions\u0026nbspand requesting she give a blood sample for screening. She checked out.At 8am on Monday the 43-year-old, who has two teenage children, Ellie and Hayden, was the first of 45 volunteers from the Seattle area to be injected in the upper left arm with a drug its developers believe could help beat Covid-19. Nothing is certain, the outcomes are unknown. But Haller and the other volunteers are happy to be playing their part.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I think we all feel so helpless,” Haller tells The Independent, when asked why she was so willing to take part. “And this was a great opportunity to try and make a difference. I’m so thankful that I have this opportunity. It’s a privilege to be healthy, and to have a job that is flexible enough to let me do this.”\u0026nbspHaller is a small but crucial part of a global effort to confront the coronavirus, which has upended lives, threatened economic ruin, confined people to their homes\u0026nbspand, perhaps, allowed us to take stock of what in our lives we ought most to value.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemAs of Thursday, global infections had topped 218,000 and the death toll raced past 9,000. Across the world, stock markets are in free-fall\u0026nbspand governments are struggling to enforce measures to “flatten the curve”.A light at the end of what could be a very long tunnel would be a vaccine to effectively treat the disease and allow life to try to\u0026nbspreturn to normal. Experts point out the disease has disrupted and devastated life in ways we are struggling to conceive. But so\u0026nbspdid diseases such as measles, polio, smallpox and tuberculosis.Reports suggest as many as 35 pharmaceutical firms, some aided by grants from government or philanthropists, are involved in the hunt for a vaccine for Covid-19. These firms are part of a massive industry and a vaccine market said to be worth $35bn\u0026nbsp(£30bn).The trial in which\u0026nbspHaller is taking part involves a drug developed by Moderna, a biotechnology firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Another trial, involving a drug developed by Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals, could start next month. A German firm, CureVac, is said to be working on a potential vaccine, one the Trump administration reportedly tried to buy.“They are all racing against the disease, rather than against each other,” says John Tregoning, an expert in infectious diseases at Imperial College London.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Also, it will help with the ability to produce as many as 9\u0026nbspbillion vaccines.”The trial under way in Seattle, backed by the national institutes of health (NIH) and Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute, involves a drug called\u0026nbsp​mRNA-1273.“Over the past few years, we have demonstrated its potential in vaccines across more than 1,000 subjects in our clinical trials,” Moderna says. “This includes successful early-stage (Phase 1) clinical trials against five other respiratory viruses (two pandemic influenza strains, RSV, hMPV and PIV3). Over the last four years, we have started nine clinical trials for mRNA vaccines.“We had previously collaborated with the NIH on a vaccine for MERS-CoV, which is a different type of coronavirus than the current pandemic. While the programme was only at the research stage, it provided significant insights.”Experts point out one of the reasons there is much excitement about what is happening in Seattle\u0026nbspis that, unlike many previous vaccines,\u0026nbspmRNA-1273 does not involve a sample of the actual virus. Rather, with input from Chinese authorities about the genetic sequence of the coronavirus first detected in the city of Wuhan, it makes use of messenger RNA molecules.\u0026nbspThese instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight again the coronavirus. It means those taking part in trials are not exposed to the virus\u0026nbspand could theoretically speed up the process of identifying a vaccine.“We don’t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response or whether it will be safe. That’s why we’re doing a trial. It’s not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.”In what critics have said is a succession of factual errors about the coronavirus and its threat to the US and the world, Donald Trump told reporters a vaccine could be produced within “weeks”.One of his top health officials, Anthony Fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, was soon obliged to pour cold water on the president’s claims.“The whole process is going to take a year, year-and-a-half at least,” he said. “I don’t want to overpromise.”Tregoning, of Imperial College London, says there is a very strict protocol that is followed with developing potential vaccines, despite, or perhaps because of, the pressure to move too quickly. As such, any drug can only be made available after approval of a national licensing body or the World Health Organisation.\u0026nbsp“What we don’t want is something making the situation worse,” he says.Coronavirus: What is herd immunity and is it a possibility?Israeli spyware firm builds software to map Covid-19 patient movementInfluencer Arielle Charnas tells followers she has coronavirus Haller, who works for a tech start-up and who says her children think it’s “cool” she is taking part, has been asked to write a daily journal and speaks on the phone with one of the Kaiser team most days.Every week\u0026nbspshe needs to give a blood sample, and in a month she will receive the second dose of the vaccine. The 45 volunteers, all aged 18 to 55, have been split into three groups, with different strengths given to each.\u0026nbspThe monitoring will last a year\u0026nbspbut Moderna says safety data will be available a few weeks after the injections are given.\u0026nbspA Moderna official told the New York Times\u0026nbspthat if the drug appears safe it will ask the Food and Drug Administration\u0026nbspfor permission to move ahead to the next phase of testing to assess its effectiveness. That would involve a larger number of volunteers.For now, Haller is going about her life, hoping her efforts can help not just her fellow Americans\u0026nbspbut people around the world.“It’s wild,” she says. “It’s incomprehensible to me right now\u0026nbspbut I am so thankful to be part of it.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is the universal $2,000 payment that sticks out as truly radical.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Bottom line here: workers need to continue to get a paycheck, even when their businesses are shut down,” said Mr Sanders.“Further, we need to provide a direct emergency $2,000 cash payment to every household in America every month for the duration of the crisis to provide them with the assistance they need to pay their bills and take care of their families.”How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Mr Sanders, who is losing the fight for the Democratic nomination, then conceded that his plan is not likely to go anywhere.“Now, we’re throwing out a lot of ideas. And when you deal with the United States Congress, you don’t get everything that you want. There will be a picking and a choosing here and there.“But I think it’s important for us tonight to discuss the various options that they have, and one of those options is to make sure that people at least get a $2,000 a month cheque to take care of their basic needs.”Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemThe proposal for what would essentially amount to a universal basic income has helped direct attention back to Mr Sanders’s onetime fellow presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who dropped out of the race after the New Hampshire primary.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once dismissed as a technocrat fantasy, it is now surfacing in proposals from people on all sides, from Mr Sanders to progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar to former Trump administration press secretary Antonio Scaramucci.In his full written proposal, Mr Sanders expands on how the payments would work, calling for an effort involving “the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Treasury Department, credit unions, community banks and other financial institutions”.He also acknowledges that not all Americans need the money, and carves out a different role for them: “For those who will not need their payments, we will partner with organisations to take donations from patriotic families who can contribute their payments to fighting the coronavirus pandemic.”Mr Sanders has fallen well behind Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, most recently losing primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois by wide margins. While conceding he is losing the race, he has so far declined to drop out many of his supporters want him to stay in to continue influencing Mr Biden and the Democratic Party more broadly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They included 21 in Beijing and nine in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere were also eight new deaths on Wednesday, according to the National Health Commission. bringing the country to a total of 80,928 cases and 3,245 deaths.Nonetheless, the lack of new local transmissions in Hubei was hailed as a major landmark in the global fight to contain the disease.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“Today we have seen the dawn after so many days of hard effort,” said Jiao Yahui, a senior inspector at the National Health Commission.Li Yang, an official from Hubei’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told a news conference that the threat of Covid-19 had not been eliminated and infection risk still persists, at both community and clinic levels.Wuhan has been under a strict lockdown since January, and remains cut off with only those with special permission allowed to travel in or out.Officials are moving to loosen travel restrictions, but only inside the surrounding province of Hubei where most checkpoints will be taken down.The lockdown in Wuhan will be lifted only if no additional cases are reported for two consecutive weeks, something which could happen as early as next month, Li Lanjuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told local media.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result of the attacks 192 health facilities were closed, of which only 34 were reopened. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attacks that Afghan authorities have blamed on their fighters.Afghanistan currently has 22 confirmed coronavirus cases, with concerns growing particularly over the danger of infections among the thousands of Afghans crossing the border with Iran: one of the worst-affected nations.The country’s woefully inadequate health system would undoubtedly be overwhelmed if the virus were to take hold. Moreover, after 18 years of war the government only controls about half of the country.The rest is either controlled or contested by the insurgents, who have agreed a peace deal with the United States but have yet to open talks with the government.Communities in ethnic Pashtun rural areas where the Taliban hold sway could suffer from the loss of access to health support in their villages as a result of past militant action.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can laugh now but it resulted in me leaving that school that I was in.I was lonely at the time. But the timelines kind of fit perfectly with me leaving school and Unitas opening.”Slowly but surely, Samiya started venturing into the facilitys other rooms, trying her hand at art or taking part in the games played in the sports hall.Over several months, she felt more herself again.Everyone is so lovely, really and truly, I’m not just saying this, Samiya says. It’s in the name. Its the unity, you know Like all OnSide Youth Zones, Unitas was set up to give opportunities to kids in deprived areas that werent previously open to them.Its name, chosen by young people, comes from the Latin motto of Barnet — unitas efficit ministerium or unity accomplishes services.Child poverty in the nearby wards of Burnt Oakand Colindaleare higher than the national average of  per cent.Woodhouse and Childs Hill also have a third or more of their children living in poverty after housing costs are considered, according to data from the End Child Poverty Coalition.Taylor Dawson is another regular whos been coming to the centre since last summer — something which he never thought hed do.He used to be so anxious that he would never leave his house unless he absolutely had to - but Unitas changed him.The -year-old now helps out with the centres sessions run on Sundays for people with additional needs.“Some can come in with autism, ADHD, anything on the spectrum, Taylor tells Sun Online.“I have additional needs myself. It helps really well, so I know how to help the other kids as well.But its not just others who Taylor is helping — hes helping himself.“It’s helped really well with my confidence, because I never used to leave my house because I’ve got anxiety, Taylor said.So I’d never leave, I’d never go out with my friends. The only place I would go is the shop and back.Taylor loves that he now has a fruitful alternative - and hes noticed a dference in the lives of others around him too.All the kids who used to roam the streets, that attitude is not nice, he said.My mum won’t put down the picture of me with him, Latoya McLean says of a photo of her with Prince Harry.The heartwarming snap was taken last year after Latoya received the Giving Back award on stage at the Royal Albert Hall during the inaugural OnSide Awards.Her prize was for young people that have gone above and beyond for their youth centre and their community”.The -year-old has been involved with Unitas since the planning stages and is now one of the centres leading figures.For Latoya, joining Unitas was all about transcending the expectations that other people had for her and her peers.Young people are seen in such a bad perspective that I think they live up to what’s expected of them, Latoya said.They never push past that boundary. Society makes boxes and expects every young person to tick it.So I guess thats why I wanted to join the group — to reach my true potential and find what I was meant to be.As members enter Unitas, theyre searched for blades and other weapons with metal detectors as they step over the threshold.Its for their own protection — one of the centres main aims is to offer kids a safe place to go.For some of the people that we work with, they might have experienced quite traumatic events growing up in their childhood — things like domestic violence, abuse, Tony says.Some young people, they’re trying to move away from a le on the road and certain types of criminality.The existence of centres in deprived areas can also have positive effects for the wider area.Members can get a hot meal for £ — full-sized portions of fish and chips are on offer during Sun Onlines visit.One parent commented to one of my staff colleagues that their food bill had come down signicantly through the course of the week because they have three or four children who come here,” Tony says. “Beyond that, local residents comment on how young people feel better about the area that they live in, that the regeneration of the wider area has made them feel more confident — and you see that in their behaviour.”A local that can attest to that is Pat Furniss, , who grew up near where Unitas now stands.The mum-of-two, who used to work as a teacher, is now on the youth centres reception and is treated as a de facto auntie by the kids.I just love seeing and hearing the laughter, I think,” Pat says. She used to hear children laughing in the streets outside her home where she grew up — but she doesn’t hear it there so much anymore. Pat added: “I actually gave up working full-time to come and work here in the evenings.And as I say to the kids, I ain’t going nowhere! I’ll be here with my zimmer frame.” The kind of remarkable changes that Tony and Pat have witnessed arent unique to Unitas in Barnet.Wherever an OnSide Youth Centre Opens, remarkable things start to happen.Antisocial behaviour in the area drops between  and  per cent almost instantly, within a month or two,” says John Roberts, Chairman of OnSides Executive Board.Truancy drops and academic rates go up for the kids that attend the youth centre — none of this is rocket science.John thinks the benefits of his youth centres are so urgent that every town in the UK should have one, in the same way that it would have a school or a GP surgery.Many of the young people who currently benefit from its centres feel a lack of societal interest could be because their generation has been misunderstood and looked down upon by others.I just think this youth centre is building up the next generation to change how society feels, Latoya says.The future is safe, she adds.We’re not going to destroy what has been built before us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating.

It always seemed odd to keep them open while telling everyone to stay home.The Government must fulfil its pledge to ensure kids on free school meals are fully funded to get fed.We pay tribute to the NHS staff, delivery drivers and social carers whose often low-paid work is so essential that their children WILL still be looked after in school.And our hearts go out to the teenagers whose GCSEs and A-levels will be postponed indefinitely.This is an unprecedented nightmare, blighting their childhoods.We can only help each other endure it.IMAGINE the evil of using a deadly ­pandemic to spread fake news furthering your political or commercial agenda.It should no longer shock us after the Salisbury poisonings.But Kremlin trolls are sowing panic online to undermine the West’s Covid- strategies.Let’s remember that, next time our leaders have to make nice with Putin at the G.Meanwhile, conspiracy cranks say hand sanitiser causes cancer — and charlatans claim their “yoghurt suppositories” or vitamin pills “cure” the virus.Where do they do this with near impunity  That’s right . . .On Facebook, which talks such a good game about policing its site — but is always found wanting.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Spiegel, co-editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, said: In this study, Covid- patients with digestive symptoms have a worse clinical outcome and higher risk of mortality compared to those without digestive symptoms, emphasising the importance of including symptoms like diarrhoea to suspect Covid- early in the disease course before respiratory symptoms develop.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.Some people will not develop all of these symptoms -  and some might not even show symptoms at all, experts say.Sir Patrick Vallance, the UKs chief scientic adviser, said: It looks quite likely that there is some degree of asymptomatic transmission.There’s definitely quite a lot of transmission very early in the disease when there are very mild symptoms.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organisation .Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.This can include pneumonia and swelling in the lungs, which can make it hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream - leading to organ failure and death.Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to drown in the fluid flooding their lungs.People with fever, cough and dficulty breathing should seek medical attention, the WHO says.The virus is believed to be transmitted between people through droplets spread from coughing and touching or shaking hands.While sneezing is not a symptom of the new coronavirus, its also thought to be a way that droplets can be spread.Tap to see where COVID- is near youSymptoms are thought to appear between two and  days.New research has found that the average incubation period of Covid- is . days.A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US found that almost allof those who develop symptoms appeared to do so within . days of infection.Experts say there is little evidence to suggest that people can spread the virus without showing symptoms.Currently, there is no vaccine to protect people against the virus.Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses - only bacteria.The NHS says that treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness.Those who are infected will need to stay in isolation away from other people until they have recovered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Opposition politicians have called for the temporary fix to help protect workers and ensure they have enough cash during the Covid- breakout. Mr Johnson did not rule out the move yesterday - prompting speculation he could take the radical move in the coming days.But a source close to him also cautioned heavily against it. The source said: Our priority is to work up solutions that can be deployed quickly, are effective and reach the right people. Critics say a universal income could take some time to work up, and it would reach everyone by its nature rather than only those with most urgent need.  Mr Johnson said introducing a universal basic income to aid financially hit workers will certainly be considered and agreed to hold talks with supporters of the proposed scheme. It comes after calls from Labour leadership contender and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey who said a streamlined cash measure was needed with the pandemic yet to fully sink in for most people.In the meantime, amendments to the current Universal Credit system are also being toyed with by the Treasury, among a range of other measures - while some experts say GDP could plummet by a fth before .  The PM has already vowed to safeguard private renters from eviction due to the virus, with landlords barred from starting the ball rolling on evictions for at least  weeks. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trumpaposs administration could give the go-ahead for monthly , payments to every US citizen as part of an billion injection to keep the economy from sinking. On Tuesday, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £bn package to help businesses stave off ruin as the country goes into semi-lockdown with social distancing likely meaning certain sectors could be decimated without proper Government support.This could otherwise lead to swathes of job losses, particularly in London where one in seven people work in the tourism, hospitality and leisure sector. There are also fears that Government loans and aid measures - amounting to a £bn boost - will only paper over the cracks and that grants are needed to ensure proper futures for those companies at risk, while some have called for national insurance to be halted and VAT bills deferred as well.  And with OBR financial watchdog suggesting stopping council tax and getting the state to pay for utility bills, Mr Sunak urged employers to postpone lay-offs until the full package has been reviewed. Some, including Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, have said the level of cash handouts and rates holiday to smaller firms - as part of a £million injection - would be great, but said the money needs to get out quickly. While Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, believes the business rates holiday is unlikely to allow bosses to target saving jobs. He said instead delaying employer national insurance contributions or delaying bumping up the living wage as well as increasing Universal Credit Allowances could be needed.CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn has suggested VAT be axed to free up £ billion, and that national insurance be reversed. The banks, meanwhile, have given the green-light for a three-month mortgage holiday for those most at risk.

A think tank wants a new Statutory Retention Payto go urgently to staff whose jobs are not needed while the UK shuts down. The Resolution Foundation says the move - combined with raising unemployment benefits and Universal Credit to £ per week - would cost the state £bn. But it would save businesses from making mass layoffs, and preserve the livelihoods of millions of workers who are only ever a step from destitution. Meanwhile Labouraposs Keir Starmer demanded Britain use a Danish-style system of paying firms up to % of their workeraposs wages. It comes as the government holds urgent talks with unions to thrash out a support package for workers. Extra support for those in limbo or losing their jobs is set to be announced tomorrow or on Saturday. Treasury minister John Glen today said the Danish system and the £-a-week idea are both under consideration. We are looking thoroughly at all these options, he told MPs.  But ministers have played down hopes of raising the £.-a-week rate of Statutory Sick Pay.  And Mr Glen played down hopes of bringing in a Universal Basic Income despite Boris Johnson not ruling it out. Even hardened Tory Sir Bernard Jenkin today lambasted the government for not reassuring people quickly enough. Treasury Minister John Glen was unable to give a firm date or time when new measures for workers will be announced. Earlier measures are simply not going to be enough, Sir Bernard told Mr Glen. Can I urge the government to say something - today - to give people reassurance that the help will come. And former business secretary Greg Clark called on the Government to pay wages for several weeksand onlybusinesses guarantee to keep workers on. At a stroke this would save jobs, save businesses and put an immediate end to the contagion and help save the economy, he said.Treasury minister John Glen told MPs: “He asks about the Danish experience and we are looking at the furlough system, we are looking at the proportion of support that’s available. “We’re also looking at the German system which in the last signicant recision in  … only % of German firms were helped. “We’re aware of what’s happening in the US. “And we’re aware of the proposals that have been put forward by ious think tanks this morning. “We are looking thoroughly at all these options.” Gordon Brown, who led the Labour Party in government during the  financial crash, said the scale of the crisis now facing the country is unprecedented as he called for international co-operation instead of populist nationalism. He said £bn of loans for firms must come with a guarantee they will not make layoffs. President Trump doesn’t need a cheque, he said. American millionaires don’t need a cheque. Figures from the Money and Pension Service in January showed .million people have less than £ in savings to fall back on - and  million people often use credit to pay for food or essential bills, according to the GMB union.  Gordon Brown added: If families donapost have income protection thereaposs a lot of other consequences: people try to workthey are sick, people put themselves at risk. Their health becomes an issue of public health and I think we really have to step in to deal with this particular blockage at the moment and I hope the Chancellor will act before the end of tomorrow. Meanwhile Labour leadership frontrunner Keir Starmer today demanded a national Income Guarantee Scheme to help workers. He called for a rise in Statutory Sick Pay, and a Danish-style wage subsidy system which compensates firms for as much as % of wages. He added any Government loan would be tied into an agreement with inidual businesses about job protection. Sir Keir said: Millions of people are already feeling the impact of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus. We have all heard tragic stories of people expecting to be laid off work or see their incomes fall. Days into this crisis ministers are still several steps behind where they need to be in order to reassure people facing a loss of income. Other countries across the world, such as Denmark, have shown what actions Government can take to protect peopleaposs incomes. “These proposals are bold, but necessary. We are potentially days away from further social-distancing measures that will change British le. It is imperative that the Government acts to support workers to buy food, pay the bills and cover the cost of living. Lib Dem acting leader Sir Ed Davey urged the DWP to suspend all benefit sanctions, assessment and reassessments in light of the coronavirus pandemic. He told Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey: No one should be worried about sanctions for failing to attend an appointment, especially in light of the Government’s latest advice on social distancing, self-isolation and avoiding public transport. According to the Resolution Foundationaposs plan, there would be a new SRP rate modelled on Statutory Maternity Pay. It would retain the link between firms and staff, thus avoiding the need for mass redundancies.Supporting a million workers via a flat-rate scheme of £ per week for an initial six months would cost around £. billion. A more ambitious earnings-linked scheme, in which staff are paid at least two-thirds their typical salarywould cost around £ billion. The think tank also calls for increasing unemployment benefits and Universal Credit to £ per week.

It describes this as a new form of “unpaid statutory leave”. The government hopes it will “maximise the number of volunteers” to fill gaps meaning that essential services can be safeguarded.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Home Office was guilty of “institutional ignorance” and “thoughtlessness” to the Windrush generation, a report found today. The inquiry by Wendy Williams said the scandal was “foreseeable and avoidable” and blamed ministers and officials. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she apologised unreservedly for the “unimaginable suffering” for the hundreds of people affected. The report was ordered in the wake of the  scandal that saw hundreds of people who came to this country from the Caribbean threatened with detention and deportation even though they had a legal right to live in the UK. The Williams report said the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants and their children had been “poorly served by this country.” “They had every right to be here and should never have been caught in the immigration net. “The many stories of injustice and hardship are heartbreaking, with jobs lost, lives uprooted and untold damage done to so many iniduals and families. “However, despite the scandal taking the Home Offce by surprise my report sets out that what happened to those affected by the Windrush scandal was foreseeable and avoidable,” the report said. Ms Williams said that even when stories started to emerge of how people were being mistreated the Home Office was “too slow to react.” “A range of warning signs from inside and outside the Home Offce were simply not heeded by offcials and ministers,” her report says. It said there was a culture of “disbelief and carelessness” at the department when dealing with the Windrush generation who were “failed when they needed help most.” She added: “While I am unable to make a defnitive fnding of institutional racism within the department, I have serious concerns that these failings demonstrate an institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation within the department, which are consistent with some elements of the defnition of institutional racism.” The report makes  recommendations, including calling on the Home Office to come up with a plan within six months to improve how it deals with immigration issues.It also calls for a full review of the “hostile environment” - the tough new rules on migration implemented by former Home Secretary Theresa May.Other recommendations include the creation of a Migrantsapos Commissioner to champion migrants to the UK and a new training programme for all Home Office staff.  Ms Patel told MPs she would respond to the recommendations in the next few months.She said there was nothing she could do to undo the “suffering and misery inflicted on the Windrush generation.“What I can do is say aposIaposm truly sorryapos. Iaposm sorry peopleaposs trust has been betrayed.”Labour MP David Lammy called for recommendations to be implemented in full and said the report was a “brutal indictment of the Home Office.”He said what happened was not a mistake or an accident but a “systemic” pattern of behaviour “rooted in a toxic culture.” Mrs May told MPs she associated herself with the apology made by the Government. “I gave my apology previously and I do so again today,” she said.

The Birmingham pharmacy came has come under fire after bottles of ml liquid paracetamol appeared for sale at one branch for about treble the average standard price. City councillor Majid Mahmood said he had five people from his ward tearfully ringing him up about the rises on Wednesday. His Bromford and Hodge Hill ward sits in one of the most deprived constituencies in England, with a  study commissioned by the End Child Poverty Coalition finding more than half of children grew up in poverty.Mr Mahmood posted a photograph on Twitter, taken in the pharmacy, showing the price of ml of Calpol as £. and a ml bottle listed for £..At other online retailers - where Calpol has sold out - prices were listed at around £. and £., respectively. Mr Mahmood added that at the same store, a -pack of paracetamol pills which had been £. last week had risen to £.. Jhoots, which runs the site, said in a statement that disparities in some branches had stemmed from an erroneous communication and it had since taken steps to correct prices. The business, based in Walsall in the West Midlands, said it would also refund any affected customers and ensure no repeat of the error. It comes as the pharmacy industry has been warning of how wholesale paracetamol prices have gone up in the current climate, due to supplier issues. Commenting on the rise at his local pharmacy, Mr Mahmood said: Business is business, they have to make a profit. But firms shouldnapost be charging extortionate pricing when you know people are desperate in a national crisis.  When youaposve got people crying down the phone because they canapost afford Calpol - thataposs wrong. He added: Jhoots have said it was an erroneous communication to some branches but the fact is theyaposve got a social responsibility as a pharmacy. In a statement posted on Twitter responding to social media criticism of the pricing, Jhoots said: It has been brought to our attention that pricing disparities occurred yesterday at a small number of our branches. We have acted immediately and conducted a thorough investigation into this matter and have found that following an erroneous communication, price increases were made at branch level.

The poignant image shows the man looking down at a shopping list in front of bare shelves in his local store in Epsom, Surrey. Other shocking images of pensioners looking for food in supermarkets with limited supplies have also circulated on social media. Lauren Taylor, , who took the photo of the gentleman, said she hoped the picture would kick the public into action to take care of the elderly. The mum-of-two explained that multiple aisles on the supermarket had limited supply. She said: It was awful and just really sad. That was only one aisle and the others were in a similar state of empty shelves. People were grabbing lots of the stuff that were still on the shelves. Itaposs really just sad and disappointing in society that itaposs got to this point. Everyone needs stuff, but he had been left with nothing. Supermarket giants have moved to limit the number of crucial items people can buy. Tesco said shoppers will be limited to buying just three products per line from Thursday. Chief executive Dave Lewis added all counter services will close, to free up staff to restock shelves, and a priority hour will be launched at larger stores between am and am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Stores that previously opened  hours, will also now close at pm each evening.  The move follows similar measures by Sainsburyaposs, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons, to ease stockpiling pressure amid the Covid- outbreak. Sainsburyaposs revealed it will only allow customers to buy a maximum of three of any single item, while Morrisons said it is limiting purchases across , lines. Asda also announced it is restricting shoppers to three items on all food and closing its cafés and pizza counters, while temporarily reducing the opening hours of all its -hour stores for re-stocking. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper across all products.  Tesco boss Mr Lewis wrote to staff on Wednesday: It is fair to say that we find ourselves in uncharted waters. Covid- is bringing a change to the UK and itaposs clear that lots of things are going to have to sht around in order to help us cope.At Tesco, we have been doing everything we can to keep business as usual, but we now have to accept it is not business as usual. In the last two weeks, we have seen signicant and prolonged increases in demand across all of our stores and this is leading to shortages in some products for some customers. It comes as Britainaposs supermarket chains are also launching action to help elderly and vulnerable customers, while ramping up operations to meet surging demand for home deliveries.  Sainsburyaposs became the latest group to offer priority home delivery slots to elderly and vulnerable customers, as well as exclusive shopping hours. Its supermarkets will only open to these two groups for the first hour of trading on Thursday, chief executive Mike Coupe said, but will open for an hour longer so other shoppers do not miss out. Sainsburyaposs Local convenience stores will not offer the service. Supermarkets have seen a huge rise in demand for delivery services, with no slots available until next month for both Tesco and Waitrose in some parts of the south east. The surge came as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps authorised a temporary relaxation, until April , of the driversapos hours rules to help deliver goods to stores across the country. The government has advised the British public to:Avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants and all social gatherings Cease all unnecessary travel Everyone should work from home where possible Mass gatherings and sporting events have been cancelled Avoid “all but essential travel” worldwide If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for  days Pregnant women, those over , and people with certain health conditions have been asked to stay at home for  weeks Schools, colleges and nurseries to close from Friday - GCSEs and A-levels cancelled A Department for Transport statement said the relaxation applies only to drivers supplying food and essential products to supermarkets. The statement added: This includes the movement of such goods from importers, manufactures and suppliers to distribution centres. It does not apply to drivers undertaking deliveries directly to consumers. Iceland outlets across the country have also introduced reserved time slots to give the vulnerable and the elderly a chance to shop in store. Sainsburyaposs said customers over  and those with a disability will have priority access to online delivery slots from Monday, and the chain is also expanding its click and collect service.

Maintaining close communication gives both of you a way to share your concerns and face them together, and helping someone  can make you feel better too. Ask for help Asking for help in dficult times is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of strength. If you find that you are feeling sad and low on a regular basis, or are experiencing high levels of anxiety, help is available to provide you with the support you need.

Tabatha Stirling, from Leith in Edinburgh, was unable to find any pasta for her -year-old son Teddy, who has Aspergeraposs and a selective eating condition, due to panic-buyers emptying supermarket shelves. Teddyaposs condition is common in autistic children and means that certain colours, textures and smells can put them off eating, Edinburgh Live reports. Tabatha said she was initially not worried about panic-buyers stockpiling certain long le items but only realised the extent when she tried to go shopping herself:She said: “It really ramped up this week, I took my  year old after school to Sainsbury’s and it was shocking. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror “That really nailed it down, there was an older lady that passed me and she said this is like when the war was on and there was rationing, but there was more food on the shelves during the war than now.”So Tabatha took to Twitter to askanyone could help her as she faced concerns over how she was going to feed her son, tweeting:“Hello, does anyone have penne pasta  My son is autistic and has very restricted eating. Penne is the only pasta he ‘can’ eat. After just a short while, the online community both on Twitter and Facebook showed support for Tabatha’s request, resulting in her receiving more than  messages and tweets of generous offers.Donors included restaurant chain Prezzo who invited Tabatha to visit their Edinburgh branch for a bag. Tabatha said: “I’ve had four packets sent to my house already and there seems to be more to come.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email The Government has announced a full shutdown of all schools with the exception of children of key workers as of tomorrow amid the coronavirus pandemic.This announcement came as the Education Secretary said people will be able to go to college and university without having sat GCSE or A-level exams. Gavin Williamson reiterated last nightaposs announcement that no exams will take place this academic year, before the summer term. Askedhe anticipated people still going into higher and further education without undergoing a formal exams process he told Sky: Yes, thataposs right. He added further guidance about how to do this will be published on Friday and talks with school leaders are still ongoing. The Education Secretary said there will have to be an appeals process for any pupil who feels theyaposve been wronged. The Mirror understands it is possible universities could use predicted grades,they resume as normal in September, but this is not confirmed. But what will the schools closure mean for children, parents and families Here is everything we know so far, as reported by Bristol Live.  What schools are involved  The Prime Minister made it clear that all schools would be involved in the shutdown across England, following announcements in Scotland and Wales. Mr Johnson also said that he would be aposexpectingapos childrenaposs nurseries, pre-schools, sixth-forms and colleges to also close their doors.  How long will the shutdown be for  The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that schools will shut their gates at the end of Friday and then be shut indefinitely - the Government are careful not to put a time frame or date on when they may reopen. When asked by journalists at the Number  briefing that happened simultaneously, Mr Johnson appeared to rebuff the suggestion, made in Wales and Ireland, that the school closures could be for as long as six months - that Friday would effectively mark the end of the school year, and the summer term after Easter would simply not happen, with schools reopening in September. He said he would hope that schools could reopen before then, but with the coronavirus pandemic rapidly spreading throughout Britain, there is no certainty at all on when they would reopen.  Who will still go to school  The Education Secretary said that schools would remain open for the children of keyworkers, to ensure that people who the country needs to continue to go to work and not worry about childcare, will be able to do so. The Prime Minister said these would be the children of NHS workers, police and emergency services personnel and aposdelivery driversapos who are critical to ensuring the continuing working of the food supply from farm to factory to shops. The Prime Minister said exactly who would be in this list would be revealed this week, before Friday - but there are no firm details as yet, on Wednesday evening.   What about grandparents  There was a specic warning from the Prime Minister that, under no circumstances, children should be now looked after by their grandparents, once they are home from school. That generation of older people are the most vulnerable to coronavirus, and the message from the scientists is that young people and the elderly should be kept apart to avoid older people catching the virus.  What should parents do  One of the key reasons why schools are now being closed is to further ensure that a partial lockdown of society happens. Parents are being asked to look after their children at home, and not leave them with grandparents, and this move is designed to increase the numbers of people who largely withdraw and remain in their homes, to stop the further spread.Most controversially, however, Boris Johnson again held back from making lockdowns and closures of businesses an order - even though all other countries in Europe are pursuing those more severe measures.  What about exams  The Prime Minister confirmed that, given schools will be closed for a considerable time and exams start in May, this yearaposs  GCSEs and A-levels would be scrapped. This does mean that exams will not take place in May and June as planned, but we will make sure that students get the exams they need and deserve, said Mr Johnson. Quite how that happens is unclear, but the most likely explanation will be some kind of grade awarded from coursework already completed, or predictive grades or grades from mock exams.  What about vulnerable children  School children who are classed as vulnerable will be still be allowed to go to school - this includes children who have an EHCP - children with special needs - and children who have a social worker or are in care.  What about Free School Meals  The Prime Minister outlined that they would be rapidly drawing up plans for a voucher scheme for children who are entitled to free school meals - but who will now not be at school to receive it each day - to get that food or support. The details of how exactly this works are yet to be revealed.

Marilyn Lundy, , says she had to leave Sainsbury’s empty-handed last week after she found the shelves stripped bare because of coronavirus panic-buying. The pensioner, from Urmston in Greater Manchester, says the experience left her feeling extremely fearful.Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Mrs Lundy explained how she and her -year-old husband, who suffers from heart problems and diabetes, have been trying to self-isolate since last week to protect themselves from COVID-.The couple normally get an online shop delivered every Tuesday, but this week only half the order arrived. Unable to book another slot until April  - two weeks away - she decided to risk leaving the house and head to the shops, only to find that other shoppers had bought up essential items. With my age and my husbandaposs health, we decided to self-isolate a week ago, Marilyn said. I thought that it wouldnapost be too dficult to do as I have been getting my shopping online for years. I will usually get a whole weekaposs shop and then I might pop into the supermarket to get the odd thing. My order arrived on Tuesday and only about half or the order actually came, so I thought okay, Iaposll just make another. These people who have emptied the shelves are now online getting what they need and I find it very wrong.” Marilyn says she is going to try and get to Sainsburyaposs for the dedicated elderly shopping hour at am, but fears she will miss out again. She says she is also worried of increasing the risk to her husband every time she steps food inside a supermarket. Where do I go from here ” she added. I tried to call Sainsburyaposs but there was no answer, I sent an email but havenapost had a reply. It just feels like people like me donapost matter. The pensioner hit out at those who have been stockpiling unnecessarily - and says supermarkets should be doing more to stop it. They havenapost done enough to stop people stockpiling, Marilyn said.  The other day I saw one couple with as much as they could get in their trolley, and once they had loaded their car, they went back into the shop to buy more. I think itaposs disgusting, I feel very hurt by it. Not everyone can shop online either. Not a lot of people my age do it and certainly not many people over the age of . People are going to the shop and there is just nothing there for them. Marilyn says she has been overwhelmed by offers of help from people on social media and local neighbours, but is keen to keep her independence. I will say that for all the greedy people out there now, there are just as many really nice people out there who have offered help, she added. But how can you ask someone who works to do a whole week shop for you. I am not so proud that I wonapost ask for help when I need it but I canapost give someone a whole week shopping list. Iaposve been independent until now and that is now being taken away from me.  Earlier this week Sainsbury’s announced it would introduce rationing in a drastic bid to limit panic-buying. Its chief executive, Mike Coupe, says the supermarket has listened to customersapos concerns about the impact of shoppersapos stockpiling behaviour on the elderly and vulnerable, and would be taking action immediately.

As European nations crackdown on freedom of movement, and encourage people to work from home, what can you expectyou fall sick with the novel flu. Since the outbreak was announced in Wuhan, China, in December , medical professionals have been grappling to understand the virusaposs symptoms and how they can be treated. Health experts say that the risk of becoming critically ill remains low and not everyone who contracts the virus will become ill. Those who do are likely to experience symptoms similar to that of a normal bout of flu. Now, the experiences of some of those that have recovered from the virus sheds some light on what we should prepare for. . Painful sinuses Painful sinuses are common when you get a fair few strains of a cold or the flu. Sinusitis can leave you feeling awful, both physically and mentally. Pain, most often paired with a dull pressure, generally occurs when your sinuses become inflamed and swollen. You may feel pain in your forehead, on either side of your nose, in your upper jaws and teeth, or between your eyes. While suffering with coronavirus, one man said that his sinuses were agony. Connor Reed, a resident of the Chinese city of Wuhan, is believed to be one of the first Brits to have caught coronavirus. Connor, who is originally from North Wales, contracted the virus in November  - a whole month before Chinese authorities officially announced the outbreak. After  days of feeling ill, recording his day-to-day le in his diary, Connor was treated at a hospital that diagnosed him as being one of the first people to get the new strain of coronavirus, Covid-. The -year-old English teacher described his symptoms starting out with just a snfle which he tried to medicate using hot whisky and honey, before succumbing to what he believed was the flu around a week in. In his diary he wrote: This is no longer just a cold. I ache all over, my head is thumping, my eyes are burning, my throat is constricted. He said his aposbones were achingapos and he had a aposhacking coughapos.  A few days later, the pneumonia had gone but he said he ached asIaposve been run over by a steamroller. My sinuses are agony, and my eardrums feel ready to pop. I know I shouldn’t but I’m massaging my inner ear with cotton buds, trying to take the pain away. Just a couple of days later, he reported feeling better. . Ear pressure As Connor discovered, another of the symptoms of coronavirus is pressure in the ears that make them feel ready to pop. But unlike Connor, you shouldnapost be pushing cotton buds into your ears to try and relieve the pressure - youaposll end up doing more harm than good. Because many of the virusapos symptoms are flu-like, this ear pressure is most likely to be caused by clogged up tubes in your ear thanks to all the nastiness of a virus inside your system. More scientically speaking, when the Eustachian tubebecomes clogged, you can feel fullness and pressure in your ear, as well as some muffled hearing and sometimes even earache. These ear congestion symptoms can also be caused by problems in your middle ear or the ear canal that affects the eardrum. So sometimes itaposs just a case of waiting for the virus to pass. . Thumping headache Again, a pounding or thumping headache is sometimes typical of a bad cold or the flu. But it can also be a symptom of other things too, such as tiredness, dehydration and even a lack of iron in your system.  So donapost go panicking straight awayyouaposve got a bit of a sore head. Make sure you drink plenty of water, get plenty of rest and try to relax. Take time away from your computer screen and avoid alcohol. Health experts are advising anyone suspected of suffering with coronavirus symptoms to take Paracetamol instead of ibuprofen, but keep yourself updated on all the latest NHS information, as things may change as more tests are done on the virus.. . Burning eyes The best way to describe the sensation of burning eyes is to compare it with the itchiness and irritation you would faceyou suffer with hayfever or other allergies. This kind of itchiness and irritation can also come about when you’re among smog, smoke, dust, mold and even animals. The only dference between these cases and the cases described by coronavirus patients, is the fact that the virus triggers this symptom and not an external factor like pets. . Constricted throat It seems as though patients suffering with COVID- experience a mixture of cold and flu-like symptoms, paired with typical symptoms of a small allergic reaction. A constricted throat can be due to swelling and inflammation, brought about after lots of coughing, which we know to be a common occurrence among coronavirus sufferers.  But a constricted throat can also be caused by an infection, allergic reaction, as well as a iety of other conditions. If you find yourself really struggling to breathe, swallow or find any lumps or bumps you’ve not seen before, you may need to be checked by a doctor immediately. So, it’s wise to keep monitoring your symptoms, in a diary like Connor, so you can see when things are beginning to change. . Aches all over It’s no secret that having a cold or a bout of flu normally comes with feeling achy. And coronavirus is no dferent.  Those falling ill with the virus have described aches and pains all over their body, not just as a result of blocked sinuses, ears or nose, but also in their arms, legs and chest too. Many people will find the current coronavirus outbreak a stressful time, too, and this stress and tension can also worsen these aches and pains. . Lungs that apossound like a paper bagapos If when you breathe, your lungs sound almost crackly, then this could be a sign of something more serious than just your average cold or flu. This sort of noise can often occurthe small air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, as well as the air you’re breathing in and out. These air sacs filling with fluid can often happen as a result of pneumonia - which is a condition linked to coronavirus. If your breath sounds wheezy, this may be down to an inflammation of the bronchial tubes in your lungs. . Fatigue Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling extremely tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult. Jaimuay Sae-ung, , was the first Thai national to contract coronavirus in December last year. Despite having underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, Jaimuay survived the illness after doctors isolated her at a hospital in Thailand for treatment.  Her symptoms included a fever and a bad cough, but she developed pneumonia while in quarantine and her family were worried she may not survive. I only knewafter I came to the hospital, the mother of seven told Sky News. I felt a bit sad, a bit shocked, tired and fatigued and I couldnapost eat. Jaimuay said she argued with doctors and nurses at the hospital because she believed she didnapost need to stay there. After  days, her condition had improved and she was eventually discharged following two negative test results. . Lack of appetite Jaimuay also mentioned not being able to eat while suffering with coronavirus. The saying goes that you should feed a cold and starve a fever, so not managing to eat much may help to burn off coronavirus in the long run. Of course, those who are ill should be sure to keep their energy up. . A fever When coronavirus was first brought to people’s attention, a fever was one of the first symptoms to be on the look out for. It was later advised thatyou had been in contact with, or indeed lived with, anyone who had a fever, you should self-isolate. For some people, this is the only symptom of coronavirus they get. One young man, who did not want to be identied, is being treated for coronavirus in hospital after ing home from a short trip and noticing his temperature had risen, the Irish Mirror reports.  He told the RTE’s Claire Byrne Live show: “The only symptoms I had was, basically, the fever. I didn’t have any respiratory problem, any lung inflammation, any cough, any sneezing so was just the fever. “I actually feel great now. I had a fever for a couple of days and now from Friday, I don’t have any more symptoms and so I am just here in the hospital being tested for the virus. The man said he was a “little worried” but “not scared” and said he can not leave the hospital until two consecutive tests show he has tested negative for Covid-. He added: The only thing I would say is that it is boring, I am here and I just have to read, watch some movies and that’s the only things. Apart from that I am fine.” . Tight chest and coughing spells Another of the first symptoms of coronavirus to be identied, was a tight chest and persistent cough. Many scientists and health professionals have suggested that the water droplets passed through a cough or sneeze are the main cause of the virus spreading, which is why they have advised the entire population to wash their hands, cough and sneeze into a flexed elbow and use tissues wherever possible. Having these symptoms on their own has meant that some people with the virus have not considered the possibility that they may have Covid-. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Carl Goldman from Santa Clarita, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship and later tested positive for coronavirus, said the virus aposhasnapost been that badapos. In an article for The Washington Post, he explained that he developed a fever and aposa bit of a coughapos during his flight back to America and was quarantined on his . I am in my late s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out for a few days, he said. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells.  If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual. His treatment, he said, consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade. . Jet lag One coronavirus sufferer described her symptoms as feeling like jet lag - a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock, or circadian rhythms, that sends signals to your body telling it when to stay awake and when to sleep. Similar to fatigue, the feeling of jet lag can make people feel that they’re not quite with it or even a bit spaced out. Bridget Wilkins, who lives in London, flew to Australia via Singapore for a friendaposs wedding last week - but is now quarantined in a hospital in Brisbane after testing positive for coronavirus. The -year-old said the symptoms she had suffered included a headache, a sore throat and tiredness. Without realising she had contracted the virus, she believed her symptoms were from jetlag after her long flight. Speaking to Australiaaposs NEWS she said she had still had symptoms but aposnothing more than thatapos. “There’s a lot of hype and hysteria on the news around coronavirus,” she said. “There should be. It’s very serious, particularly for the elderly and people with existing conditions. But I think we have to calm down, because for most people, like myself, it is just a long cold that we can shake off.

Dave, from Erith in south east London, said: “Itaposs made us all feel worthless and that we are being left to rot.

Where did coronavirus come from  The recent coronavirus outbreak originated in the Wuhan Province in China.Dr Akash Patel, Medical Director and GP at MyHealthcareClinic said: According to recent research and genome analysis, the coronavirus seems to have originated in bats and been transmitted to humans via another animal.While the first transmission has not yet been identied, very early cases were traced back to a live-animal market in the city of Wuhan China. It is likely that a human either consumed or came into contact with fluids from an infected animal. He added: There have been conspiracy theories and some questioning whether the coronavirus is a bioweapon or whether it escaped from a lab, however the latest studies have suggested that in all likelihood the coronavirus occurred naturally as the structure and the RNA sequences are closely resemble those which are found in bats and pangolins. The reason we see this virus causing a pandemic is due to our lack of immunity to a virus our bodies have not seen before.  How does it spread According to the NHS website, itaposs still not officially known how coronavirus spreads.It says: Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Itaposs very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food. However we do know that the virus can survive on certain surfaces, such as cardboard and plastic, so it can be picked up from everyday items.

Ashleigh Tolley was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to her Labrador called Roo. The poorly pup was found by inspectors collapsed in the hallway of a flat in Leigh, Greater Manchester, surrounded by her own faeces.She couldn’t even lt her head due to being so weak and had to be carried out of the property, the Manchester Evening News reports.Tragically, her health deteriorated rapidly and the decision was made to put her to sleep. Wigan and Leigh Magistrates’ Court heard how concerned neighbours alerted the RSPCA to -year-old Tolley’s flat as they were concerned her dog had been left unattended in the property for some time. They said they had not seen Tolley for days. Inspector Emma Dingley was sent to the address on September  and knocked on the door. When she got no reply, she looked through the letterbox and could see Roo collapsed on the hallway floor in her own faeces. She was in an emaciated state and Ms Dingley could see a large tumour on her front leg. She called the police for assistance so she could enter the property and rescue Roo. The poor dog was extremely cold and too weak to stand so she was carried out of the property and rushed to the RSPCA’s Greater Manchester Animal Hospital. Staff at the centre placed heat pads on Roo as she was suffering from hypothermia and gave her fluids as she was severely dehydrated. The veins were very collapsed, which made placement of a catheter for fluid replacement very dficult. Vets said the ulcerated tumour, measuring approximately cm by cm, would have caused Roo suffering for weeks.  Inspector Dingley said: “Roo was in an awful state when I went to rescue her. She was laid in her only faeces and couldn’t stand as she was so weak and in poor health. “She was freezing as there was no heating in the property so I wrapped her in a blanket and comforted her. “She was clearly starved and as I cradled her in my arms to carry her to the van she knew I was trying to help her and she tried to wag her tail. It was heart-breaking. “Staff at the animal hospital were doing all they could to save her but she was basically dying in front of our eyes and there was nothing we could do. She refused to eat even though she was starving. “Sadly the following day she had deteriorated further so the vet made the decision to put Roo to sleep to end her suffering. “It was so upsetting for us all - I just take some comfort from the fact she had kind people with her when she died and was not frightened and alone in the flat.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA married couple who plan to have children together say they are deeply in love - despite them both having other partners. Bettina and Tavish live in Massachusetts, along with Bettinaaposs boyfriend Adam and Tavish’s girlfriend Ellie. The polyamorous quad say their decision to open up their relationships has been met with disapproval and bafflement from outsiders – although all their family have been supportive of their multi-love approach. Bettina and Tavish first considered opening up their marriage because of Bettina’s agoraphobia, which made it dficult for her to socialise as much as Tavish liked. Bettina said: “I was really interested in exploring polyamory with Tavish. I really encouraged him to do that because at the time I was dealing with agoraphobia and it frequently is dficult for me to go out. “He wants to go to clubs, he wants to go on road trips, I canapost do that. So it was a way for me to encourage him to explore his hobbies and interests with other people who shared them without pressuring me into stepping out of my comfort zone.” Dating more than one woman was something Tavish had wanted to do for a while but had always felt like it was a taboo. He said: “All my le I had always kind of had a hard time only liking one person at once, so keeping my crushes to myself was kind of hard, even though Bettina could totally pick up on it. So, I don’t know, when we decided to officially be poly, it just kind of felt like a weight was lted off of me.”  Tavish’s girlfriend Ellie, is also married. Her husband and childhood sweetheart is currently living in a dferent state while he finishes grad school. She said: “My husband and I, we decided to be poly, openly started dating other people, about five or six years ago. “And then a couple months later I met Tavish and, it was a whirlwind kind of thing.”  By this time Bettina had also met her boyfriend Adam and he’d already moved in with Tavish and Bettina. On a rare night out for her, Bettina starting talking to Adam over drinks. Adam flirted with Bettina only to put the brakes on when he learnt she was attached. But something about their connection - not to mention her telling him she was polyamorous – and Adam telling Bettina he was drunk, brought him back. Adam told Truly: “I had a couple of drinks, I talked to her then she told me she had a husband so I said, ‘whoops’. And then my drunk incoherent self, decided ‘just talk to her’, I started talking to her and hit it off.”  The couple exchanged numbers and soon started dating. Adam is the only one of the four to be dating one personexclusively. And while the four adults all live together under one roof, they are not all in relationship with one another. There is nothing physical or romantic between the same sexes. Tavish said: “Adam and I have a very bro relationship with without being bromantic.” Ellie describes hers and Bettina’s relationship: “like non-romantic partners”, with Bettina joking they are “sister wives, without the religious connotations of sister wives.” The quartet say they have had to get used to constant questions and assumptions about their sex lives and that the reality is a colour-coded calendar and designated bedrooms but with a fluidity to switch sleeping arrangements. Bettina said: “We have a colour-coded dry erase calendar on our fridge, and that’s the only way we can keep it all together. “So everybody has their time with their partners, we have time as a family, and then that allows us to also have time inidually.” In many ways, the challenges of being in a polyamorous relationship are no dferent to a monogamous one, says Tavish: “I think the challenges in a polyamorous relationship arenapost that much dferent than the challenges in a monogamous relationship. You know, getting your needs fulfilled, pursuing your interests, finding time for yourself, that type of stuff doesnapost necessarily go away.  There are times when everybodyaposs in the house, and I just want to be left alone.” But a perhaps more unique challenge that they have had to deal with is the double standards when it comes to perception of Bettina having two male partners versus Tavish having two female partners. Bettina said: “A man with multiple female partners, thataposs pretty cool, right  But whileI have a boyfriend or a husband, I’m a slut, whataposs wrong with me  “And because Iaposm open about my polyamory and our relationship, the reactions I get are of a very sexual nature. So the questions I get are like, ‘well do you guys have orgies  do you guys have three ways apos  “Iaposm not even going to go there, and it just seems bizarre like nobody ever asks us, ‘oh, how do date nights work ’ or aposwhataposs the dynamic in your house apos or aposhow long you guys lived together apos Grateful at least that they haven’t been met with opposition from their own families. The quad hope to start their own family soon.  Tavish said: “Weaposve been very fortunate that all of our families have been super accepting about it. “Bettina, and I foresee a future where we are going to have children together. And Ellie and I have a future where we first see us having children together too.

We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling. It’s not really sunk in yet.”Dundee have gone six matches unbeaten, with five consecutive clean sheets, and sit third in the table.The Dens men are just four points behind second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle, who they were due to play this weekend before the cancellations.Forster said: “The season as a whole hasn’t been good enough for us but the way things were going recently, it was starting to look positive for us with regard to hitting form in the lead-up to the play-offs.“There was a real bit of optimism building and it’s frustrating that that momentum has just been stopped with no indication of when we’re going to be able to play again, andwe are going to be able to play again this season at all.“I’m a big believer that whatever is going to be will be. You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally.

The prices are reasonable, the food is fresh and the service is good.Six of us were heading out for Saturday afternoon drinks and eats.We’d found the menu online and liked the look of it so booked a table.The bar was busy. It’s set out in three areas – seating in front and to the side of the bar, then a conservatory type area round the back of it and more tables through towards the front of the building.There are wooden floors and lots of Australian touches – the logo is a map of the country with the name in the middle and it pops up everywhere. Seats y from low tables and high tables to bar stools and benches and there are several TVs which were showing sport when we were in.The large kitchen hatch opens on to the bar. You can see all the dishes being served and they all looked good.The menu has nine categories – small plates, ribs and wings, loaded fries, burgers and dogs, from the outback , side lines , pizza, favourites and the healthy outbacker .We ordered a small fish supper , a steak sandwich , a steak pie , a Caesar salad with chicken and bacona Cajun chicken pastaand classic burger with fries . The Caesar salad orderer had threatened to have nachos – how is that ever a main course She said as they can be served with chicken or chilli that made them a main course. I’m not convinced.Another friend was very specic that she wanted just a plain burger on its own . . . so no lettuce tomato or sauce with it  Oh no she says, I want all of them. So it was more a classic burger with EVERYTHING then . . .Ethan took our order and was friendly, attentive and fun –perhaps a little nervous of the burger lady because we told him she was trouble.We had drinks while we waited and I wasn’t watching the clock as we were busy chatting, but the food came out in reasonable time and looked fabulous.The small fish was a good size and in crispy batter. Two of the girls shared that and the pasta, which was in a creamy flavoursome sauce with “just the right amount of heat” and slivers of pasta and served with two slices of garlic bread.The menu had said the steak pie came with mushrooms, fries and garden peas. I was poised to steal the mushrooms, but there were none, which suited the diner as she doesn’t like them. Everything on the plate was enjoyed.The salad was a good sized portion with plenty of dressing and crispy croutons with a lot of chicken and bacon – and obviously more meal-like than nachos!That wee plain burger with nothing but everything on it, was apparently very tasty too.I made a bit of a mistake with my order. The steak sandwich was described as beef strips and fried onions in a pepper sauce on toasted bread with mayo, lettuce and served with salad and fries.For some reason I’d thought the pepper sauce would be capsicum rather than black pepper – it wasn’t and I’m not a pepper lover.However, it was a good mistake as everything  was delicious enough that I could forgive the wee peppery taste. The beef was tender, the fried onions moist, the sauce tasty. The salad was thin strips of peppers and onion in a dressing and it all pulled together well and the skinny fries were just as they should be.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Countries with a more dirigiste approach, like France, and outright authoritarians, like China, are taking the lead with hyper-lockdown backed by fines and riot police and sweetened by bold promises that firms and workers will not lose out.Whether that is possible or just vain-glorious hot air from the Elyseacutee Palace remains to be seen. The Scandinavians are taking a typically communitarian approach and promising people that the state will provide calibrated compensation to bolster incomes. But their social safety net was anyway far more generous than in neoliberal Britain.We have the lowest pensions, the lowest sick pay, the most miserly unemployment benefit and income support. And still millions are unable to access it in the gig economy or because they earn too little. Britain after a decade of austerity is a low-wage, low-security economy, and that isnrsquot going to change overnight. Or could it The country will have to be mobilised as in a war. The Second World War was actually very good for the economy ndash or at least good for GDP. The United States turned industry into a weapons-making machine of unprecedented productive power. The Arsenal of Democracy turned out hundreds of warships, thousands of tanks and bombers, millions of guns, billions of pieces of ammunition.Wages and profits soared during the war economy in America and in those parts of the world not actually devastated by the fighting. It was war production that finally brought the Great Depression to an end. Indeed, it arguably laid the groundwork for the next  years of global economic growth.Full employment became the default policy for western governments. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated. We had the NHS, welfare, mass consumerism. Then came inflation, globalisation, neoliberalism and the financial crisis.After , the Government and the Bank of England mobilised some pound. trillion to stave off a collapse of the financial system. That was a very crude way of dealing with the crisis and created moral hazard by rewarding bankers for their reckless greed.But that isnrsquot going to work this time, evenwe wanted it to. The banking system is not the epicentre of this crisis. And the inconvenient truth is that the Covid- crisis is not going to be like the Second World War.Battleships and Sherman tanks are useless against an enemy like a virus. We can produce respirators and intensive care units in large numbers and probably quite quickly ndash quicker than many people seem to believe. But that is not going to make the economy boom.The coronavirus economy is more like the Great Depression, when millions were out of work, demand dried up in the shops, the economy went into a deflationary spiral and even loose credit and money-printing become pointless. Put simply:no one has any money to buy stuff, stuff doesnrsquot get made. Money needs to get into peoplersquos pockets, and fast. What we did for the banks in  we must now do for people.However,you simply throw printed money at a situation like this, the danger is that we will end up with what they have in Zimbabwe: hyperinflation. So we are going to have to create a simulacrum of a war economy. People will have to be remunerated for the socially responsible task of staying at home for the duration.This is a bit like Universal Basic Income, only more so. The trouble with UBI, advocated by right-wing economists like Milton Friedman, in Capitalism and Freedom, and sponsored by tech billionaires today, is that it is essentially universal basic poverty. The sums talked about in the UK, or deployed in the experiments such as in Finland, are nugatory ndash around pound a month. That is too little either to keep body and soul together or provide effective demand in the economy.What we need is more like Universal Average Income. People will need to have something approaching their remuneration pre-Covid to stop them going into spontaneous spending lockdown. If that happens, the demand shock across the economy ndash and itrsquos already happening to airlines, restaurants and hotels ndash could destroy the economy within a couple of months.The good news is that ndash unlike the Second World War ndash we do know who is going to win in the war against Covid , and we know it will not last for many years. Around  per cent of us will get it the vast majority will be fine and the epidemic should be over in  months at the most. We didnrsquot know that about Hitler.In the aftermath, the Government might also have to consider job creation on an industrial scale. One way would be to go with the flow and recruit redundant service workers into the caring professions. The Government could create a kind of National Social Care Service to parallel the NHS. People could retrain as psychologists to treat the growing problem of mental illness.In the s, Franklin D Rooseveltrsquos New Deal measures to combat depression, economic and psychological, included investment in the arts. Unemployed writers, artists and performers were put to work by the Federal Arts Project to improve the quality of le. That gave us Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Orson Welles, John Housman. The arts may seem low on the priority list, set against food supplies and the health service, but it would be a tragedytheatres closed and talent went to waste.We need something to elevate the spirit. There is a serious risk that with the malign effect of social media, people are going to be subject to waves of paranoia, fear and depression. I feel it myself. We live in a spiritually-deprived culture where we are not accustomed to living with death. The churches were where people turned in moments of crisis in the past. Twitter is a very poor substitute for faith.Read more: Herd immunity does not mean the Government is trying to kill old people"},{"url":null,"title":"helen-mcardle-game-theory-tells-us-britains-reaction-coronavirus","story":"To me, it bears all the hallmarks of the Prisoners Dilemma, a famous paradox used in game theory to illustrate why everything from society to international relations is often hobbled by human beings innate selfishness.For the uninitiated it goes like this. Two alleged criminals are placed in isolation. Both care more about their personal freedom than solidarity with their accomplice. The prosecutor offers each the same deal:you confess and your accomplice remains silent all charges will be dropped against you and your testimony used to send your accomplice to jail for a long time the same appliesthe accomplice confesses and you choose to stay silentboth confess they will get early parole andboth remain silent the prosecutor will settle for token punishments.The crux of the dilemma is that whatever the other does, each is better off confessing than remaining silent. But the outcome obtained when both confess is worse for each than the outcome they would have obtained had both remained silent.The irony is that because neither trusts the other to \"do the right thing\" , both choose to act in their own self-interest - and end up worse off.Soyou want to understand why hoardes of panic buyers are clearing the shelves of pasta, paracetamol and antibacterial hand gel despite retailers assuring them that there is no need, and why they feel able to dismiss thoughts of elderly or more vulnerable people unable to load up a car or to afford huge stockpiles, the Prisoners Dilemma is a pretty good illustration.They are behaving selfishly because they expect that everyone  will too. Perhaps they are simply scared and want to ensure their family is protected. But the fundamental point is a lack of trust between iniduals.I may be wrong, but I am not aware tales of panic buying and stockpiling being reported in Asian nations such as China, Japan and South Korea.But when coronavirus swept through the West, one of the first things citizens of Australia, Europe and the US did was to plunder the supermarket shelves.Perhaps it is a marker of our contrasting cultural norms : the West values liberty and celebrates inidualism East Asian traditions seek to balance the interests of the inidual with their wider community, with each person seeing themselves in the context of their family, neighbourhood, and nation and encouraged to be mindful of others in whatever they say and do.It is notable that when a World Health Organisation team was parachuted into China in February on a fact-finding mission, its experts came back describing that everywhere they went they encountered \"a sense of responsibility and collective action\".All over China, not just in the epicentre of Hubei province, people had voluntarily quarantined themselves and were cooperating with neighbourhood leaders appointed to ensure that people complied with instructions to self-isolate or socially distance themselves as much as possible.Yes, of course Chinas Communist political system makes it easier to implement and enforce stringent lockdowns.But now the democracies of Europe are fast realising that these same tough measures will be the only way to curtail a virus that has no respect for cultural values or borders.Italy, the worst hit country in Europe and the first in the continent to impose a lockdown, is beginning to see signs that the spread is slowing. The most recent -hour data showed that Italy recorded , new cases on Tuesday - a rise of .% on the day before and the slowest rate of increase since the contagion first emerged.The deadly Spanish Flu outbreak in  already showed us the value of of early intervention. In the US, St Louis cancelled events, closed schools, churches, and theatres, and imposed tough social distancing restrictions two days after the the first cases were reported.Philadelphia delayed doing the same by more than two weeks, with authorities downplaying the signicance and allowing a city-wide parade to take place.The result  In Philadelphia the death rate from pneumonia and influenza peaked at  per , compared to  per , in St Louis.We know it works, but authorities also know it is hard for people to obey. For now the public are told that they \"should\" stay away from crowded spaces.But when I walked home last night there were people in bars and pubs, because - as we know already - people are selfish. Until pubs are forcibly closed, this will continue.The best advice is to behave asyou are already infected because \"no man is an island\" and our behaviour, however innocuous it might seem, could have unforeseen and catastrophic consequences on others."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11078403.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-asda-joins-supermarkets-move-ration-products-amidst-panic-buying","story":"Britains grocery industry has struggled for over a week to keep shelves stocked in the face of stockpiling, which worsened on Tuesday despite weekend appeals for calm from supermarket bosses and politicians.The supermarket chains chief executive Roger Burnley said in a letter online that Asda has ldquoimplemented a limit on the number of items that can be purchased to make sure everyone can get what they need.The Co-operative convenience chain ndash which has , stores across the UK ndash has also introduced restrictions for the first time for the most popular products.

Taking Control: The Dominic Cummings Story, was a look at Boris Johnsonrsquos chief aide by Emily Maitlis. Quite the accolade. An hour-long film in a prime time slot by the slayer of Prince Andrew. Must be a very important chap.You would think so by the talking heads asked to sum Mr Cummings up in a word. Determined, said one. Challenging, said another. Unreasonable. Renaissance man. A myth maker. Unpleasant. Genius. Dangerous.: Johnson promises help for rentersThe producers had even dug up Peter Mandelson, who was once to Labour premiers what Mr Cummings is supposed to be to Boris Johnson, but with infinitely better clothes. ldquoHe could just completely blow himself up, purred the Labour lord as he stroked an invisible white cat, ldquobuthe doesnrsquot hersquos going to be a very signicant figure over the course of the next ten years.While a familiar canter through the Cummingsrsquo cv, starting with his work on the Nocampaign, and taking the story through to Vote Leave, Brexit and into Number , it was worth watchingonly for Maitlisrsquos interview with Colin Perry, who told of his now famous encounter with Mr Cummings decades ago.During a heated discussion on  Live, Mr Perry, chair of the CBIrsquos small business council at the time, called Mr Cummings ldquoa young politician on the make. Their spot over, Mr Perry said he was walking down the stairs from the studio when he felt Mr Cummingsrsquo hands on his shoulders. ldquoHe was trying to push me down the steps, he claimed. At the bottom of the stairs he said he turned to confront Mr Cummings only for the younger man to seize him by the tie, push him against the wall and raise his fist. Mr Cummings said they had merely stumbled into each other.: Holyrood spring conferences axedThe programme asked what Mr Cummingsrsquo ldquoextraordinary rise told us about how politics was changing. Its central idea was that he was among the first to detect and then ride the wave of populism that led, among other things, to Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson. Scotland played a part in this tale in as much as Mr Cummings, then working for Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, suggested his boss visit Easterhouse in a bold move to show how the party had changed. Easterhouse, then, was the early prototype for the ldquored wall that delivered a huge majority for Mr Johnson in .Going back to those one word assessments of Mr Cummings, Irsquom with the journalist Peter Obone who described him as ldquodull. It is hard to take seriously the idea of Mr Cummings as a genius, the sage of Downing Street, in large part because he has committed the most basic error of any adviser and become the story. Being visible, he is expendable.Moreover, one cannot help thinking thathe was that smart he would be in Boris Johnsonrsquos job and have a lackey of his own. Mr Cummings is not the messiah. Hersquos not even an especially naughty boy . He just happens to be the latest catnip mouse for the media to play with till it gets bored.: Schools to close by end of weekThe main feeling on watching Maitlisrsquos documentary was that the concerns it highlighted were dated and irrelevant. Not so much five minutes ago as five months. Much has been made of how the coronavirus crisis is changing our lives and will have a long term impact in ways we have yet to fully appreciate. I donrsquot know. The triumph and tragedy of humans is that fundamentally we do not change that much. Capable of great kindness and empathy, as in the many people who are volunteering to help others, they can also be the same grubby, panic-buying shower to be seen in every supermarket.That said, the crisis is having an impact on politics. I donrsquot mean the suspension of party hostilities. That will not last. As yesterdayrsquos PMQs showed, there is growing pressure on the UK government to help the poorest and most vulnerable to the same extent that it is aiding business.The crisis is, however, shaping the way Mr Johnson does political business, from the new ministerial structures and implementation committees to the daily televised press briefing. I would not be surprisedthese White House-style events became permanent fixtures, like televised debates during elections, in London and Edinburgh. Any chance to hold governments to account is good for democracy.One way and another, the man who a couple of weeks ago was being slated by critics as a part-time Prime Minister is putting in quite the sht.So, too, is Nicola Sturgeon, and though it is hardly a competition she is coming out of the process better. All over the world the virus crisis is testing leaders and governments as never before. Whatrsquos that Warren Buffett quote  ldquoOnly when the tide goes out do you discover whorsquos been swimming naked.Thus we have the so-called strongmen of politics, from the US president down, exposed as vacillating and unconvincing. The most prized government commodity today is trust, and we can see who inspires it and who does not. Mr Johnson is beginning to look tired and bowed. If this crisis does prove to be a marathon not a sprint he needs to pace himself.If the past weeks show anything about politics it is that in times of stre people still look to inidual leaders for guidance. No-one ever responded to a crisis by saying, ldquoSend for the PMrsquos chief aide. That reliance on leaders is fine, as long as the right man or woman is in the job.From Edinburgh, London and Paris to Tehran, Washington and further afield, we will soon see the proof of that."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-learn-love-lockdown-8-tips-surviving-life-home","story":"Then yoursquore walking through a supermarket ndash its empty shelves like missing teeth in a mouth ndash and eyeing an old lady piling toilet paper, oil, beans, soap, flour and rice into her trolley.

Furthermore, she appears to be blissfully unaware about the comprehensive financial package to support businesses and iniduals which has been announced by the UK Governmentwith the promise of further action to follow when required. Furthermore, unlike Spain, we have a very low unemployment rateand a much better debt to GDP ratio which means we can borrow at a more attractive rates.

Neither has given any indication that it intends to protect healthcare professionals who are \"in the front line\".As a retired pharmacist, I feel very strongly that no signicant protection has been offered to pharmacists and their staff who are exposed to \"the potentially infected\". Despite notices on shop windows such as \"We have no stock of masks, gloves and hand disinfectant\" they continue to come in and ask \"have you got...\". The GP practices and health centres have declared \" Gonnae No come here\" and this policy is supported by the Government.Pharmacy is at the front line. Each dispensary should be provided with a protective shield ndash a Perpsex bank-type barrier. All front-line pharmacy staff should have total facial protection, disposable gloves and gallons of disinfectant. I know that none of these protective elements is currently provided by the Government: I accept that the NHS cannot be held responsible for this failure.I would also point out that the owners of the pharmacies have not made any signicant attempts to protect their staff.

It seems that any fabric or absorbent surface is much safer.

They keep using the pejorative term U-turn to describe a change of direction in Government reaction to the coronavirus situation. In science, when new data comes to light that an extant theory cannot accommodate then a new theory is sought that can accommodate that new data. We do not say that scientists have done a U-turn.

And, as has been demonstrated by the unprecedented move that we made yesterday in terms of closing schools, scrapping exams and all forms of other assessment, we will take the incredibly tough decisions that are sometimes needed in order to ensure the safety of the population.Transport for London has already announced up to  London Underground stations, which do not interchange with other lines could be closed while the Waterloo and City line and Night Tube services will not run from Friday.Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, who is due to hold talks later with the PM and senior Whitehall officials, suggested transport in the capital could be scaled back even further.He told the London Assembly: \"I want to be clear now that the frequency of services is likely to continue to reduce, potentially very signicantly, over the days and weeks ahead.\"We will do this in a way that makes sure essential workers can still get around and we will not reduce service levels so that the remaining trains and buses are crowded.\"Mr Khan stressed that all residents of the capital should \"strictly follow\" the official advice, noting how he would be working from home as much as possible.\"We are clearly still in the early phase of this crisis but the spread of the virus is at a more advanced stage in London than in other parts of the country.\"This means that further measures will need to be introduced at the point at which they will have the biggest effect. I can assure Londoners that this is under constant review by the experts.\"He warned that it might be necessary to introduce bans to stop people gathering in bars, restaurants and continuing to mix together in defiance of expert advice. He also pointed out peoplersquos civil liberties might have to be curtailed to stop more lives being lost to the Covid- virus.Giving evidence before MLAs, the Mayor, asked about a Paris-style formal ban ie ordering people to stay indoors except in certain limited circumstances, said: ldquoWe are not there yet. The advice from the Government is just advice. That provides a mixed message. Itrsquos clearly not been clear enough. We may move to a situation where we move from advice to bans.Mr Khan criticised Londoners who were refusing to follow the official guidance on social distancing and were still travelling around the city.In a direct message to the capitals residents, he said: \"I cant say this clearly enough: people should not be travelling by any means unless they absolutely must.\"The scientic advice on this is very clear: Londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary and this includes avoiding using the transport network.\"I want to see more Londoners following the expert advice, which means its critical that we see far fewer Londoners using our transport network than is currently the case.\"The Mayor said the capital was in the midst of an immensely challenging and anxious time for all Londoners.\"We are all rightly worried about our most vulnerable family members, friends and neighbours.\"But London has been through tough times before and throughout our citys history we have repeatedly demonstrated the power of coming together in common cause. Now is the time for us to do so again because we all have a part to play in preventing the spread of the virus and helping to save lives,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-tesco-sainsburys-asda-open-offer-delivery","story":"But beyond the schools, transport and health sector, the effects of COVID- is being keenly felt in supermarkets across the country.Many stores have altered their opening hours to deal with the increase in customers and stock-piling attitudes that have left their shelves barren.Heres an updated list of the opening hours of some of Scotlands most popular shops:Tesco announced on Tuesday that all -hour stores would cease being open all day.

That means we will continue to plan and prepare for the weeks ahead, working closely with our NHS partners and following national guidance on public health.“Our aim is to ensure the resilience measures we have in place best meet the needs of our local community and minimise disruption as far as possible to the services we provide.#There has been widespread concern regarding visiting cruise ships and the OIC has faced criticism for not shutting its ports.Council leader James Stockan moved to reassure the Orkney public.He said: “Elected members met our senior management team to review the extensive steps already taken to prepare for the likely impact on Orkney of the coronavirus pandemic.#I believe the organisation is well prepared to respond effectively to what is a fast-changing situation.“I am aware there is concern in our community about visits to Orkney by cruise ships. No other port in Scotland has stopped such visits and we are following national guidance on this.“We have had port health procedures in place for many years for dealing with cases of infection aboard ships of all kind. These procedures are aimed at preventing infection coming into the country.”All cruise ships have been asked to provide a maritime declaration of health before visiting Orkney, whether or not they have any illness on board.Cruise companies are already well underway with cancelling voyages.The council saysthere was a suspected case of Covid- aboard a ship, the council’s port health and NHS Orkney’s public health teams would work in conjunction with Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Government to decide on the best course of action to take.If a situation of this kind arose, the most likely outcome is that the ship would be redirected to a port on the Scottish Mainland close to more specialist health facilities, OIC adds.Councillor Stockan added: “Although there has been a focus on cruise ships, people do of course travel to and from Orkney by other means — and that makes it very dficult to prevent the spread of the virus into the county.#This makes it all the more important that we as a council — and our wider community — do all that we can to reduce the potential impact on us all.”To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and to protect local communities as far as is practicable, OIC is only allowing travel by staff and elected members to meetings and training events on the Scottish Mainland in exceptional circumstances.In Orkney, councillors and staff will not be attending community council and other public meetings.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Public events due to be held there have also been cancelled.For the time being, lessons are still on upstairs in The Reel unless tutors decide otherwise, although this is to be reviewed daily.Other businesses, such as pharmacies have announced reduced services, with W.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages.

Mr Lewis said the Government was determined to deliver on the arrangements in place, including the Good Friday Agreement. East Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson had sought assurances from the minister that there would be no border or disruption to trade. Mr Wilson said: In a recent visit to Belfast, EU officials and Michel Barnier made it quite clear to the business community that, first of all, they expected a hard border in the Irish Sea and, secondly, they expected the Government to start implementing the things which need to be done to put that in place. Would hegive us an assurance that given that the Government has a dferent interpretation to the withdrawal agreement than the EU has, that no steps will be taken to put either a physical, administrative or electronic border in the Irish Sea which would disrupt trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain  Mr Lewis responded:makes an important point and I#m very happy to be very, very clear about this. We are determined to deliver on the agreements that are not only within theprotocol but within the Good Friday Agreement, so we ensure that there is obviously no border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There willbe no border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and there will be no hard border in the Irish Sea.

Mental health charity Mind says you can still get outside and benefit from fresh air and the natural environment while minimising your risk of catching the virus.. BirdwatchingBirdwatching is a good way to get out in the fresh air and interact with nature, says Phil Carson, policy officer for sustainable farming with the RSPB.I think it#s a good thing to do because you get away to quieten your mind and it#s quite a mindful activity. It allows you to tune out, appreciate the things that are around you and focus on something that isn#t on TV or negative news, he explains.If you#re going to a shoreline or estuary, you can still see some of the wintering waders and wildfowl.You can see curlew along the shoreline, which is pretty brilliant to look at, and there are redshank, another iconic bird,you are around Belfast Lough.Coming into spring,you are in woodland you#re starting to see migrant species coming back, such as the chfchaff, a warbler from northern Africa which is starting to make its way through.Rewarding places to birdwatch include the RSPB#s Portmore Lough nature reserve which has plenty of wide open spaces where you can stay clear of other people while getting your wildle fix.Some of the waders are coming into breed there at the moment - you could see little grebe along the lake shore, reed bunting in amongst the reeds and wigeon and teal as well.Anywhere that has woodland would be quite interesting this time of year, such as Belvoir Forest or the woodlands in the Glens of Antrim are always pretty good, Phil adds..

You can go it alone with the One You Couch to K app, which gives you a choice of coaches and helps you track your progress.. ArtDrawing or painting can be a great way to connect with nature without stomping through miles of mud.Artist blogger Ella Masters advises bringing a small sketchbook and using drawing materials that dry quickly, such as pencils, pastels or thin layers of watercolours.. Tai chiWe#ve all seen footage of people in China outside in parks performing the elegant moves of tai chi.Bangor-born Tai Chi teacher Michele Gibsonsays: Normally we do our classes indoors because the weather in Northern Ireland is not generally very suitable, but it can be practised outside - in China they do it outside all the time.But you can do it in snow as long as you#re well wrapped up - you can do it outside at any time.Michele says Tai Chi is a series of exercises that work on dferent parts of the body.They tend to be breathing exercises as well as movement. The movements are aerobic without being like an aerobics class, so they#re good for your heart and lungs in a very gentle way, she says.Tai chi is good for high blood pressure. It massages all your internal organs and it#s very good for your balance.It#s good for your muscles and tendons, keeping them strong and keeping your bones healthy. It#s an all-round good exercise which can be done by anybody. It can even be done sitting down, although it#s mostly done standing.I would recommend it to anybody who feels they need a little exercise but doesn#t want to pound it out in the gym. It#s not overly taxing. If you get up sore the next day you are not doing it right.. Go on a picnicThere#s nothing stopping you from wrapping up in a warm coat and hat, filling a thermos of hot tea and talking yourself up to the top of a mountain.There are loads of places off the beaten track for a picnic with a view, from Divis Mountain and Cregagh Glen to the rugged Kearney coastal walk on the Ards peninsula..

Mountain bikingMountain biking is a high adrenaline and exciting way to get out in the fresh air without coming into contact with others.But Outdoor Recreation NI marketing office Ethan Loughrey says you don#t even have to be super-fit to go mountain biking, with the advent of the new electric bikes.One of the benefits of the fitness elements is getting out on the bike, but the new electric bikes allow people who are unfit or older to get out and get some exercise as well, he says.Most of our National Trails Centres have trails between km and km so there is a good workout, and the good thing about it is that you can stop and admire the view along the way.All the National Trail Centres have very scenic spots where you can stop, such as Kodak Corner at Rostrevor Forest.There#s a lot of research showing how good getting out into nature is for you and for your mental health.It#s advised that people who haven#t gone mountain biking before shouldn#t go alone and Ethan recommends that people should pick a trail dficulty level that suits them - it#s green for beginners, orange for intermediate and red for advanced, with black for particularly fast routes.Mountain biking is still very popular and we#re seeing a lot of people on social media being out and about a lot more than normal at the minute. It#s a nice way to get away from hearing about the virus  , Ethan says.Everything can be a bit overwhelming with the front pages, but mountain biking can get you away from that and give you a bit of perspective while giving you some exercise..

Its job is to keep you safe from nasty germs that might infect you and most of the time it does a great job. This is why pc of people will fight this virus with minor symptoms.But sometimes your immune system isn#t up to the job. This can be because you become infected with a massive dose of a virus, which runs amok and makes you feel awful. Or perhaps you are over  and, like most things in your body, your immune system is less able. Or you might be taking drugs that suppress your immune systemyou have an inflammatory disease. Oryour heart or lungs are weak, the virus can really harm you. So the question is, is there anything you can do to boost your immune system  The answer is a resounding yes.Look after your immune systemTo know how to take care of your immune system, first you need to understand the weapons your immune system has, which are actually very impressive. When you come into contact with a germ you#ve never met before you#ve got ious barriers to try to stop it getting into your body. As well as skin, you have mucus - snot is a really important barrier as it traps germs and has special biochemicals that can kill them, in this case mainly bacteria. Your body is also actually covered in bacteria, inside and out , and many of these are beneficial. They out-compete the bad guys and even make chemicals to poison them. This stops the invader from eating the resident bacterias# lunch.The germs can sometimes win, however. They have cunning tricks up their sleeves to breach the defences. A virus like SARS-CoV burrows inside the cells that line your lungs. That#s where they multiply. However, pretty soon the rapid response unit of your immune system will arrive. Special white blood cells can attack the invader. So-called macrophageseat the germs up and destroy them. They also call the alarm to bring out another white blood cell called a T lymphocyte. These are like police superintendents, controlling everything and even killing off the virally-infected cell themselves to stop the virus spreading. It#s the T lymphocytes that remember, so that when you get reinfected they are good to go. T lymphocytes are an important aspect of why vaccines work. They also control another important white blood cell, the B lymphocyte. This is the cell that makes antibodies. These are very specic proteins that are great at stopping a virus like SARS-CoV in its tracks and B lymphocytes also remember.We remain optimistic that there will be a vaccine soon. Vaccines are weakened forms of a germ or part of it, which causes a weak immune response. But the cells of the immune system are now trained. And when the intruder comes they kill it. It#s a bit like the sherf has put up wanted posters around town and when the bad guy turns up he#s recognised and killed quickly and you won#t even know you#ve been infected. This is why it#s so important to get a vaccine for Covid-.What can you do The trick is to keep all these cells of your immune system fit and healthy. This begins with what you eat. A ied diet with lots of high-fibre foods really boosts your immune system - immune cells love healthy food and hate fatty foods, so a healthy diet is essential.Also,you don#t over-eat and have good gaps between meals, this really mobilises the immune system increasing the numbers of immune cells by as much as three-fold, so lay off that second piece of pie and have gaps of at least four hours between meals. Don#t over-do this, though, as being malnourished has a hugely negative effect, as can be seen in developing countries where it#s a huge cause of death from diseases like TB.Do probiotic drinks work The evidence for taking probiotic supplements is mixed. It#s much more effective to change your diet to a healthier one.And what about vitamins Vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. It is used by our immune cells, and is something that people across the island of Ireland can get quite low on in the winter. So it#s good to take in more of it. Taking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for those who are well-fed. Eating your five-a-day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels. It#s water soluble so you will just pass any excess into your urine.Stay activeTo be immunologically fit, you also need to be physically fit. White blood cells can be quite sluggish. Exercise mobilises them by increasing blood flow in your body, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy all over your body. Adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least  minutes a week of moderate aerobic activityor  minutes of vigorous activity . Either suffice.The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. Anything#s better than nothing. But a letime#s exercise could signicantly stop your immune system declining with age. In , a study found that  non-smoking amateur cyclists aged  to  still had the immune systems of young people.Like eating, you can overdo it though. You can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system. Elite athletes are more prone to infections. So don#t overdo it. As ever, moderation is the key.Stay calmOne of the many effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can decrease immune , a common example of which is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. During periods of stress, it can reactivate again and you get shingles. And we all know that stress makes us more susceptible to colds and flus. Worrying about Covid- might actually make you more susceptible to it.What about alcohol Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis though, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. This is one reason why alcoholics are more prone to infections. So the hot whiskey might make you feel better for a short time but it might also slow down recovery.Sleep wellExercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to infection. A study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of immune cells. If you#ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything#s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you#ve got problems.So the bottom line is a good night#s sleep, combating stress, a balanced diet, and moderate exercise are all great at boosting your immune system, in the never-ending battle between us and the germs that infect us, and that includes the latest bundle of evil, SARS-CoV.

Alongside £m already announced by the Treasury the day before, this amounts to an injection of more than £m, the Secretary of State said.Meanwhile, Stormont has unveiled a £ million official grants programme for vulnerable businesses, alongside a rates holiday for three months for all businesses.It comes after the public have been asked to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, while hundreds of flights and hotel stays have been cancelled, leaving businesses struggling with cash flow.On Tuesday, the Chancellor Rishi Sunak vowed to do “whatever it takes” to help the economy, as he warned that “never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one”.Among the financial measure outline by Mr Sunak is £bn in government-back loans for business and a rates holiday.If you are a Northern Ireland business owner, here#s what support is available to you.Q Will I still have to pay rates, evenI have had to close A On Tuesday, Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced an emergency £m rates package for all Northern Ireland businesses.

No one will be penalised for any attending the office, she said, adding that those who usually have to submit medical advice or certicates in person are not currently required to do so. Q Will I be contacted about my face-to-face interview A We#re contacting those people over the next few days to let them know their appointments have been suspended initially for a period of three months. We will be constantly reviewing that, said Ms Hargey.  Q Is there any other support available A The Communities Minister said she will address discretionary support payment legislation over the next few days. These are payments for those who are on a wage from April  of under £,, low income families who are fallen on hard times - that they can come and apply for a grant for things like household costs, food bills, heating costs, she said. Ms Hargey said she is also moving on issues such as statutory sick pay and universal credit. Those workers who happen to lose their jobs here who are on contracts or who are self-employed can now come forward to claim those benefits and get that additional support, she said. Q I am on the Steps  Success employment programme - do I have to attend A Ms Hargey said: All programmes going forward will be suspended for a period and people will not be penalised for not attending the office.Q I work in a small business - what will my job prospects look like in the near future A Speaking in Stormont on Monday, Mrs Dodds revealed plans to re-ert laid-off staff in the coming months.I think it is something that my department will quickly look at,we are in the position where firms have to close, she said. Many people will have skills in food preparation that we may need in our hospitals and so on as this thing reaches a peak, so we will be looking at this and how,one business closes, there are opportunities in other areas.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus fact check: From masks to mortality rates - how to separate fact from fictionThe coronavirus crisis has become a breeding ground for myths and conspiracies - how do we separate fact from fiction \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHow former army trauma surgeon Michael Ryan from Ireland is leading global fight against coronavirusDr Michael Ryan was at home in his kitchen in Galway one day, and his phone rang, the caller identied himself as Bill Gates.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland Assembly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As testing is only being carried out when cases are needing hospitalised, I would like to reiterate that it is a suspected case.I had made an application to the Department of Education for two exceptional closure days on Thursday  and Friday  March.However, I have been unsuccessful and these have been denied.A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said: Requests for exceptional closures should be made initially to the Department of Education.These are likely to be approvedneeded to facilitate an enhanced deep clean following discussions with public health professionals.If schools have submitted an exceptional closure which has not been approved and are able to provide a fuller explanation as to why the closure is needed, then the Department would be happy to review the request.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland Assembly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one really knows how this is all going to pan out, but we came up with the WhatsApp idea because we thought it would be a good way of ensuring that people would always be able to make contact with someone near them.We delivered notes to all the houses in the street urging anyone who was interested to join the group so we would have a means of communication without coming face-to-face.The plan is to share any information we have with each other and to share any supplies that people desperately need over the next weeks and months. We#ve already shared out food, like pasta. The group is a very practical solution to a very real problem.One neighbour has been able to provide fresh food too.They keep chickens, so it#s hoped that eggs can be left on people#s doorsteps as and when they require them, said Jonny.The idea is one Jonny thinks could be rolled out in other areas.But he appreciates that a major dficulty could be networking with older people who do not have access to a mobile phone.We are lucky in that most people have mobiles and they#re happy to link up, he said. The feedback has been really positive.Jonny and Lisa have lived on Beverley Way for several years without knowing any of their neighbours particularly well - until now. Thathas been an added bonus, said Jonny.The mum and dad have jobs in east Belfast but are expecting to work from home for the foreseeable future.Their three children, Linusand six-year-old twins Edie and Tilly, are being prepared for home-schooling now that their school has closed. We#re drawing up timetables for the kids and we are also introducing contracts for them about their behaviour. They are similar to the disciplinary measures that there are in school for the pupils, Jonny explained.We#d been planning to introduce all this during the summer holidays, but we#ve now brought everything forward to term time.It#s not just Jonny#s home le that has been hit by the virus, but his love of football too.I#m a big fan of Ards Football Club and though it#s not the most important thing in the world at the moment I will miss watching them, he said. Our social club is shut, so that#s draining the resources for the football team too.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fe-db-ca--bcafddc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"BooksCoronavirus: Bookshop delivery service a huge hit with customersA bookshop that launched a delivery service for customers facing quarantine has been overwhelmed by the response.Northern IrelandSpar shops limiting purchasesSPAR, Eurospar, Vivoxtra and Vivo stores in Northern Ireland have implemented a restriction on the purchase of all products.UKDown distillery#s sanitiser missionA Co Down distillery that has turned its hand to making sanitiser desperately needs more bottles for another batch.Northern IrelandNIFRS safety at home warningThe Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Servicehas announced new measures to help keep firefighters and the public safe during the coronavirus pandemic. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland Assembly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I can#t see it happening at the moment, God knows how it#s going to affect the housing market, he said.Two of his friends were also among the  staff to be temporarily laid off by the Beannchor group.A lot of people will have dependants living in the household, others are living together and sharing rent, he added.People in hospitality are often on minimum wage and working on zero hour contracts. They have quiet periods after Christmas but they usually plan for that.But no-one expects that to go on after March. Those people definitely don#t have the savings to see this out.Mr Hagan#s mother Christine Boydsaid her son felt panicked over the sudden loss of his job.He#s lost everything, he#s literally no money to pay for his car insurance or phone bill. All he got was a call to say #sorry there#s no work#, she said.It was a big deal for Jack to get this job. He has ADD and Tourette#s Syndrome so he has a lot of issues with socialising.Now it#s been taken away and it#s set him back again.He#s had to go to the jobs and benefits office to get Universal Credit which for him is about £ a month.He#s panicking now because he doesn#t know where he#s going to get the money from, I#m going to have to try and help him out.He has been quite down and even I#m quite anxious worrying about him. I spent about three hours on Friday on the phone and filling out forms for Universal Credit.So that#s been stressful and I needed to take time off work to help him.She also called for measures to help the economy currently being used in Italy and the Republic of Ireland.I#ve got rent to pay andmy younger son comes home from nursery, will I have to keep paying for it  she said.If I knew those bills were frozen it would make a big dference to me. At the minute I#m not sleeping very well because of this stress.The government need to be clearer about what they#re doing to help everyday people.Meanwhile, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster Colin Neill has said that Northern Ireland is now facing a tsunami of job losses.Speaking to the Stormont Assembly Economy Committee, he said: We now have a disaster on our hands. This is an emergency situation.Overnight thousands of jobs went to the wall and we are expecting thousands to go by the end of the day - this is real and the government are watching this happen as time ticks away.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related Workers# lives #put on hold# and savings #obliterated# as coronavirus job losses take toll across Northern IrelandTributes pour in as Nobel Prize winner and #a true soldier of peace# Betty Williams dies at Coronavirus QA: What support is available for businesses in Northern Ireland DUP calls for abortion reform to be dealt with at Northern Ireland Assembly,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However it is still important that the Government offers clarity around staff pay. Many businesses have already had to let staff go because they simply do not have cash to pay them without any money coming into the business. It is crucial that there is clarity around staff pay and how staff can continue to be paid so that they can pay their livings costs and feed their families. “We also need clarity on how and when businesses can apply for these grants, who is eligible to apply, and how quickly this funding will be released to businesses. The Chamber will be looking at all of these measures and is ready and available to support the Executive in getting crucial information out to businesses in the coming days.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The government has advised people with symptoms to stay at home and to not leave their house for seven days or If they live with other people, all household members have to stay at home for fourteen days. However, trade unions for medical professionals are pushing for access to Covid- tests so that they can know whether they are infected with the virus and in danger of passing it on to patients. googletag.cmd.push They say that based on current advice, the same people may have to self-isolate more than oncesymptoms re-emerge because without testing there is no way of knowing whether they are immune or still at risk to themselves and other people. GP at Aberfoyle Medical Practice, Dr John O’Kelly raised concerns that one of the doctors at the centre who had a high temperature and flu like symptoms is now off and self-isolating as per government advice. The local doctor said he rang the Western Trust and was told it is not testing health workers yet and he will therefore be off for an ‘extended period’. googletag.cmd.push  Dr O’Kelly, who is former Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Northern Ireland said the practice is managing to cope with two doctors off at present but the loss of any more staff would put signicant pressure on resources. “With regards to testing, I think it would be helpful for testing to be available for health professionals, carers who are attending elderly and infirmed patients and Nursing Residential staff. “If we lose health professionals for - weeks this has a potentially serious knock on effect on the service we can provide.” Askedit was worrying that health workers could potentially be forced to self-isolate more than once, he added: “You are correct that people could be off repeatedly.

Testing will continue to be carried out as appropriate on iniduals admitted to hospital and testing may also be carried out to support the management of outbreaks or clusters of disease in residential or care settings. Testing capacity is urgently being expanded in order to enable testing of essential healthcare workers.” In response to a question from Derry Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson earlier this week, Health Minister Robin Swann, revealed that ‘owing to constraints on lab capacity, locally and nationally, testing is now being prioritised for a number of groups’. “The current order for priority testing during periods of signicant demand is, first, a patient requiring critical care for the management of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome , influenza or an influenza-like illnessand, secondly, a patient with an alternative indication of severe illness, such as severe pneumonia or ARDS,” he explained. “The next group is all other patients who require admission to hospital for the management of pneumonia, ARDS or an ILI. A further group is the cluster of disease in residential or care settings for example, long-term care facilities and prisons. Symptomatic healthcare workers will be tested as well. “That is under active review, nationally and locally. Additional capability is being urgently worked up in the lab system, and that will ease some of the demand pressures on lab services. It is not that we have reduced testing but that we are now prioritising the testing capability that we have available, and we are increasing that capability.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A core aim of the surge plans - covering the immediate period to mid-April - is to prioritise essential services and free up capacity across the system. The Minister spelt out the plans in a written statement to the Assembly. He stated: “Our health service will fast become unrecognisable. Changes that would have seemed unthinkable weeks ago will become the new norm. Decisions that would previously have taken months or even years will be taken in hours.” He also stated: “If social distancing and other measures are implemented by the population, with a combined effect they could reduce the peak by some % and reduce deaths by up to a third. Planning assumptions also indicate that % of infected people will require hospitalisation, .% will require critical care, and % will die – although these figures will y highly depending on age and other health factors. googletag.cmd.push “There is no doubt that these measures come at a cost. They will be dficult for people to stick to. They will have signicant social and economic impacts. But they will save lives.” The Minister praised staff across the health and social care sector, stating: “I am proud of you and I commit to giving you my full support in the days and months ahead. The words ‘thank you’ seem woefully inadequate in the circumstances but they still need to be said – on behalf of everyone across our society.” Mr Swann also appealed to the general public. “We all must continue to rigidly follow the advice on hand-washing and ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ when we cough or sneeze and use a tissue. I cannot emphasise this enough. This will help keep more of our family members, neighbours and friends well and by doing so reduce pressures on our health service. As I have already stated publicly, doing the right thing is essentialthe health and social care system is to get through this. googletag.cmd.push “This also includes following all the social distancing guidance to the letter, not just today, tomorrow and next week but throughout the months ahead, for as long as it takes.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A core aim of the surge plans - covering the immediate period to mid-April - is to prioritise essential services and free up capacity across the system. The Minister spelt out the plans in a written statement to the Assembly. He stated: “Our health service will fast become unrecognisable. Changes that would have seemed unthinkable weeks ago will become the new norm. Decisions that would previously have taken months or even years will be taken in hours.” He also stated: “If social distancing and other measures are implemented by the population, with a combined effect they could reduce the peak by some % and reduce deaths by up to a third. Planning assumptions also indicate that % of infected people will require hospitalisation, .% will require critical care, and % will die – although these figures will y highly depending on age and other health factors. googletag.cmd.push “There is no doubt that these measures come at a cost. They will be dficult for people to stick to. They will have signicant social and economic impacts. But they will save lives.” The Minister praised staff across the health and social care sector, stating: “I am proud of you and I commit to giving you my full support in the days and months ahead. The words ‘thank you’ seem woefully inadequate in the circumstances but they still need to be said – on behalf of everyone across our society.” Mr Swann also appealed to the general public. “We all must continue to rigidly follow the advice on hand-washing and ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ when we cough or sneeze and use a tissue. I cannot emphasise this enough. This will help keep more of our family members, neighbours and friends well and by doing so reduce pressures on our health service. As I have already stated publicly, doing the right thing is essentialthe health and social care system is to get through this. googletag.cmd.push “This also includes following all the social distancing guidance to the letter, not just today, tomorrow and next week but throughout the months ahead, for as long as it takes.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bronagh Cooper has worked in the community for over  years and has been working as a SPRING Social Prescriber with Bogside and Brandywell Health Forum since its launch in July . She has changed the lives of hundreds of people within the community, helping to tackle the issues of mental health and depression.SPRING social prescribing is a new initiative which takes a holistic approach and works with iniduals offering more than medicine. Social prescribing creates a link between the health service and the community and enables a GP or primary health care professional to refer patients who suffer from social isolation, low mood, mild depression, chronic pain, long term conditions or physical inactivity to community support programmes and activities.Bronagh is the SPRING social prescribing co-ordinator for the Western Health and Social Care Trust area, and in the last year alone, has received  referrals from people in Derry on the SPRING Social Prescribing Programme. Social prescribing is rolled out across Britain and Ireland, and Bronagh underwent a rigorous interview and skills test to be appointed the Norths Social Prescribing Link Worker Champion. She said: “Becoming a champion means my role is to raise the profile of SPRING Social Prescribing and that everyone in the community recognises it as a good model of practice. We also want to ensure that social prescribing is recognised as a health profession, like social work and other health professionals are within the health services, and funded by the Health Service.”Social prescribing is available to anyone over -years-old and has been adopted as a good model of practice by GPs across Northern Ireland. The pound. million SPRING Social Prescribing project is funded by the National Lottery Community Fund and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs . The health project aims to reduce pressure on GPs while improving the health and wellbeing of patients across Northern Ireland. Bronagh added: “Social prescribing encourages the social model of health care. If an inidual goes to their GP with symptoms, like depression or chronic pain, the GP will then give them a social prescription. “That is where I come in as a social prescriber. It is my role to meet with the inidual and get to the bottom of what the cause is. GPs only give medication to treat someone with anxiety, but my role is to find out what the root cause of the anxiety is and help address that. “The aim is to reduce the amount of medication a person is on and to reduce the number of visits required to the GP practice.“I find a lot of joy in my work. My purpose is to guide people to programmes to help improve their health. For example, I had a client, a young man in his ’s. He had no friends or family for support and was regularly visiting his GP, being treated for depression. His GP, gave him a social prescription and I met with him and realised the root cause of his depression was social isolation.“We co-created a support programme of things he would enjoy. I am there to guide him and accompany him to his first few classesneed be, giving encouragement and support. He has gone from sitting at home alone all day to being out of the house five days a week attending his local men’s shed, cooking classes, exercise programmes and counselling. He has gone from having no interaction with anyone, to creating a community support network and is much happier. “I have older clients who may have been bereaved, and lost their sense of self or clients with chronic pain or long term health conditions. “Social prescribing is about looking at the needs of the inidual and looking at the needs of the community and putting those support programmes in place. For example, we have set up two chronic pain supwWalking group. The idea grew from a girl in her ’s who wanted to exercise but didn’t want to be seen. I had done the Camino and found great peace walking in nature. I wanted people to experience the same peace so we put the nature group in place and go on dferent walks each month and then have some tea and buns in a cafeacute afterwards,” said Bronagh.The nature walking group is open to the whole community, as is all of the support programmes established by SPRING Social Prescribing. “The idea is to identy the need within the community. People tell us what they need and we put that support in place. We don’t isolate our programmes, they are open to the whole community and to anyone who feels they would benefit,” explained Bronagh.“I have found that people know they need help, but they don’t know where or how to get it. My role, and the role of SPRING Social Prescribing is to guide them to that help,” added Bronagh.To find out more about SPRING Social Prescribing in your area log on to https:www.springsp.org  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s a social thing really.”Originally from Kent, the love of a local woman brought him to these shores in  where he played for BBOB and Foyle Wanderers.And like all sportsmen, father time eventually tapped his wicked finger on the shoulder and the time arrived for O’Connor to call it a day.“I wasn’t enjoying football anymore you worry about injuries as you get older. And I thought I’ll give refereeing a go.“The first game I reffed was a DuPont game and I loved it straight away,” says the Englishman with a straight face. “I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the Saturday Morning League. You really look forward to the weekend.”Boasting six dferent referee kits these days, the modern refereeing wardrobe is as colourful as some of the language O’Connor would endure at a Tamnaherin Celtic match. While watching games on television is very much a bus man’s holiday for the affable  year old whistler. “You’re watching the referee all the time you’re even watching the linesman. I find myself calling ‘Offside!’ during games like a lunatic.” googletag.cmd.push PreferenceGreysteel man Sean Curran officiates all codes in GAA and soccer, but has a strong preference. “I love Gaelic games,” he states. “I find the soccer to be a bit boring to be honest. Underage soccer is better because of the level of skill these days, it’s a joy to referee. But definitely Gaelic Games is my first choice.”Do referees need a thick skin  “Very! You have to be a certain type of person. You have to be strong mentally. You have to be able to deflect all the flack you can get.”  PICTURED: Local referee John Crossan. The  year old shares Dennis O’Connor’s passion for the officiating trade. “I love it,” he says. “It’s a passion I have. I started out just doing it for my club but then I wanted to do bigger and bigger games. And I wanted to improve my own standards. I’ve refereed over  matches now and I’ve enjoyed every one of them.”Hurling referee Mark O’Neill agrees with Curran that a hide like a rhinosaurus is crucial to succeed in the refereeing game.“%!” he laughs. “Look, I gave it to referees all my le. I argued with referees over most decisions, and I suppose this is now karma coming back at me. As a referee you have to take the higher ground. In the first five seconds after an incident you have to give the player a bit of time to digest a decision he or she may strongly agree with.“In GAA you can move the ball on  metres. You don’t have that in soccer. I find that really helps in GAA, as it turns it back on the player where their team-mates turn on themthe ball is moved forward.“Rugby has the same idea,” he continues, “but the respect rugby referees get is amazing. There’s nothing worse than slabbering, and the sin bingives the person ten minutes to simmer down.” ContrastingRugby referee Glenda Mellon cuts a very much contrasting figure on a Saturday afternoon. “I started  years ago after I stopped playing and coaching,” she explains. “It gave me a way of being involved in the sport I love without the bruises and pain on a Monday morning.”Finishing up her own stellar rugby career, Waterside woman faced the same dilemma as many of her refereeing compatriots. What next   PICTURED:Rugby referee Glenda Mellon “I really enjoy it as it gives me something to train for,” says the youthful  year old. “Its also competitiveyou want it to be. You want to improve your assessment scores and get moved up the levels to get better games.”But refereeing can prove to be a dficult balancing act too for the family woman. “The worst thing is the mummy we guilt of being away all day Saturday.“I enjoy the games most when the players have a bit of banter with me,” she continues. “But its usually quite funny when players forget whos reffing and call me ‘Sir’ during a game, and then get very embarrassed when they realise what they have said.”‘Fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ quoth the great Roy Keane, but he probably hadn’t anticipating this answer from Glenda Mellon on how she readies herself for a rugby match.“Fake tan, eyelashes and French plaits!” she chortles. Fair to say not the typical response you would hear from a referee, but a welcome addition in le’s rich tapestry.  PICTURED:Referee Mark McGarrigle gives a yellow card to Sion Mills player. As a potential hobby refereeing might appear as soul destroying as checking your bank balance after a big weekend. Apart from all the grief you endure from players and spectators alike, there’s not much glamour in changing your clothes in a small cattle shed, or in the back of a lorry container in Donemana – where a shower with warm water a dim and distant prospect.A sunken soggy pitch at Leafair, or a bracingly cold morning at Lisnagelvin where the wind would blow a traveller off his cousin – only the lion-hearted need apply to the reffing trade.It’s not for everyone. But to the small minority who take up the whistle, and remember we couldn’t play or watch sport without them, referees are an integral part of the game and we should salute them. And just like footballers, hurlers and rugby players across the country, the misery of a poor game can follow them around like a mangy dog.Playing the game tends to be a selfish act. ‘Love’, ‘passion’, ‘give something back’. These are the collective themes that knit together and resonate when you speak to referees about their motivations.Somebody once said being a rare boy is not a crime. Well neither is being a referee.  PICTURED:Former Derry City and Celtic star Niall McGinn with local referees, Marty Dunne, Dick Tucker and on right, Gerry Morrison.

It was Magheras first year in the senior competition, after the school was formed seven years earlier. St Malachys Belfast were crowned as MacRory champions in the second game of the double header. Earlier in the season, Maghera ran them close in a challenge game earlier in the season. Managed by Sean Spud Murphy, the Derry men were back-boned by Laverty and Mickey Moran at midfield, stated ious press reports after the game. googletag.cmd.push Behind them, sat a solid half back line of Frankie McCotter, James Crilly and Kenny Bradley, whose second half covering was superb, and a forward line which displayed the ability to combine in their approach to scoring. Maghera were well drilled in the arts of the game. They knew when to hold the ball, when to pass and when to use the long delivery. Had the attack taken the point chances which came their way they could have doubled their final tally. Laverty elected to play with the wind at their backs and after hitting the first two points of the game, a defensive error allowed Omagh in for a goal. googletag.cmd.push Before the break, Maghera were back in the game with a goal that began in their defence. Frankie McCotter cleared a dangerous Omagh attack. Mickey Moran gained possession, who in turn passed to Fintan McCloskey. Pat ONeill took over and after drawing out the Omagh defence, he released Eugene Laverty. The Lavey man ran through in the clear before hammering to the back of the net past Tyrone senior teams reserve keeper Ciaran Harte. The goal helped Maghera go in at the break on level terms, - each. After the interval, skipper Laverty won the throw-in and after speeding up the wing, passed to Pat ONeill, who shot over the bar – giving Maghera into a lead they never lost. Liam Harbinson had a goal ruled out for square ball but made up for it shortly after for a neat finish. He was a noted soccer player and after dribbling the ball through the heart of the Omagh defence, he slotted past Harte. Fintan McCloskey and Brendan Kelly scored points for Maghera but Omagh hit back. After an error in the Maghera square, after Peter Finns long ball, Omagh dangerman Joe McGrade fired an unstoppable shot to the net. Only a goal separated the teams, - to -, but Fintan McCloskeys burst up the right wing relieved the pressure. Brendan Kelly pointed a free, followed by a Moran effort from long-range point eased the pressure before Lavertys point on the final whistle saw Maghera finish strongly.

Like many others at present, the drama student at Ulster University’s Magee Campus is working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic but her mind is firmly focussed on the task at hand on Saturday night. She’s having ‘withdrawal symptoms’ from not seeing her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila, who have also become household names thanks to their guest appearance on the show. googletag.cmd.push But Brooke has been calling them on a regular basis and wants to ensure they’re kept safe.  The -year-old is from Bellaghy Co. Derry but lived in the Rosemount area for two years while studying and has family connections in the city. Her love of music developed at home, growing up her father ‘almost burnt the house down’ when he fell asleep as a child listening to the record player. None of her family are singers but they’re all passionate about music and listen to the ‘golden oldies’. Brooke’s own taste has been informed by those cherished records and she’s been fortunate enough to see idols live such as Dolly Parton, Cher and Tina Turner. Other favourites include the Eagles, Aerosmith and John Mayer. googletag.cmd.push She never envisaged a career in music - ‘every competition I entered I never got through, except from one year at Ballymena Festival which I won’, she said. Unbeknown to Brooke a friend submitted an application of her to audition for The Voice UK . She was shocked to get call back from the producers before going across to England in April last year, where she secretly filmed her Blind Audition – an experience shrouded in secrecy from her wider friends and family. AFFIRMATION  At the beginning of January Brooke’s first appearance was aired on ITV. All four coaches were visibly moved by her performance. First to turn were will.i.am and Meghan Trainor and they were quickly followed by Sir Tom Jones and Olly Murs. A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

Like many others at present, the drama student at Ulster University’s Magee Campus is working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic but her mind is firmly focussed on the task at hand on Saturday night. She’s having ‘withdrawal symptoms’ from not seeing her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila, who have also become household names thanks to their guest appearance on the show. googletag.cmd.push But Brooke has been calling them on a regular basis and wants to ensure they’re kept safe.  The -year-old is from Bellaghy Co. Derry but lived in the Rosemount area for two years while studying and has family connections in the city. Her love of music developed at home, growing up her father ‘almost burnt the house down’ when he fell asleep as a child listening to the record player. None of her family are singers but they’re all passionate about music and listen to the ‘golden oldies’. Brooke’s own taste has been informed by those cherished records and she’s been fortunate enough to see idols live such as Dolly Parton, Cher and Tina Turner. Other favourites include the Eagles, Aerosmith and John Mayer. googletag.cmd.push She never envisaged a career in music - ‘every competition I entered I never got through, except from one year at Ballymena Festival which I won’, she said. Unbeknown to Brooke a friend submitted an application of her to audition for The Voice UK . She was shocked to get call back from the producers before going across to England in April last year, where she secretly filmed her Blind Audition – an experience shrouded in secrecy from her wider friends and family. AFFIRMATION  At the beginning of January Brooke’s first appearance was aired on ITV. All four coaches were visibly moved by her performance. First to turn were will.i.am and Meghan Trainor and they were quickly followed by Sir Tom Jones and Olly Murs. A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

Decisions taken by council to date has been to cancel the planned St Patrick’s Day spring carnival celebrations in Derry and Strabane, the cancellation of all travel and attendance at conferences by council staff and members and the introduction of proactive measures to protect and reassure staff and users. Members attending the meeting were also informed of the proactive contingency measures being put in place to protect vital council services. googletag.cmd.push In view of this, members agreed that council should close two of its public buildings with immediate effect, to allow vital services to continue in anticipation of other facilities being forced to close at a future date. The main civic council offices in Derry Road, Strabane and the Brandywell Sports Centre building will both close from this evening at pm for operational reasons, to allow these buildings to be available and fit for purpose to provide essential public services over the coming weeks. The Glenside office located behind the civic offices on Derry Road will remain open to the public and Derry Road staff are being relocated to alternative sites including Glenside, Strahan Road or the Civic offices in Derry’s Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push Members at the briefing heard that the closure of the buildings would allow council to carry out essential services such as waste management, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, cemetery provision and financial services, during this challenging time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Michaela Boyle reassured the public that council is taking a very proactive role in its contingency planning to mitigate against the impact of COVID- and the decision to close the two centres was made in the best interests of people in Derry and Strabane and the safety of council staff. She said: “By closing these two buildings and making them sterile zones it will allow us to provide a reduced but essential level of service provision. The Council has a duty of care to its staff and the public and this is a very responsible approach to a very fluid situation. We will continue to work with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and reviewing all Council service provision and Council organised events on a regular basis. Any changes to services or events will provided as soon as any decision is made.” The Mayor also confirmed that she has cleared her public diary and has decided to cancel the Mayor’s monthly Tea Dance. Mayor Boyle said this decision was also made in the interests of the health and safety of the attendees, the majority of whom are older persons. She said: “The monthly Tea Dance is a hugely popular event for members of our older community across the city and district. In view of their age and the risks associated with this virus, it was felt that we needed to cancel this event for the foreseeable future. Council members will meet with senior officials tomorrow to consider progress and to further monitor the situation. The council will continue to liaise with Governments and statutory agencies, including the Public Health Agency and the Department for Health, on advice and guidance in relation its emergency contingency planning.  Members of the public with any queries are urged to contact the Council directly on    or follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who

This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out.

Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :. Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race. A big thanks has to go to our driver, Ciara Coffey, who finished seventh lady in ::, and co-pilot Dickson.With these two women at the helm what could possibly go wrong  All that can be said is that it was a good job the mountain foggy today and navigation skills werenrsquot required.With all the uncertainty about future races over the coming weeks, all runners are advised to check the NIMRA and race web pages before travelling..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"LOCKDOWN  ","story":"ALL Newry, Mourne and Down Council buildings across the district have been placed in lockdown for two weeks as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.The unprecedented decision mdash which will be reviewed at the end of the month mdash applies to the local authorityrsquos Downshire Civic Centre headquarters in Downpatrick, Down Arts Centre, Down County Museum, Down Leisure Centre and all other leisure and community centres across the entire district.Councillors unanimously agreed the move at an emergency council meeting on Monday night but are allowing limited public access to the Downshire Civic Centre in order for the public to submit planning and building control applications, register births, deaths and marriages.Staff who work at the ious council facilities which have been placed in lockdown will remain in place and continue to be paid, with politicians warning that the closure could potentially last for many months.All of the districtrsquos household recycling centres remain open and bin collections will continue as normal, with politicians insisting that the staff who deliver these particular services are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Council-owned parks, including Delamont outside Killyleagh, also remain open.The decision to close the doors of all council buildings to the public to help keep them safe and prevent the virus from spreading, came just days after councillors pulled the plug on yesterdayrsquos planned St Patrickrsquos Festival parade in Downpatrick.Mondayrsquos decision by councillors to close public buildings came in the wake of the virtual wipeout of the districtrsquos sports programme due to the virus, with all sports now suspended.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll.

There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On parade in Toronto in “This year it is will be marking its th anniversary, with Orangemen and women from across the globe expected to congregate in the city for the occasion.He explained that the Toronto Twelfth takes places on July  to accommodate the many visitors who have taken part in demonstrations where in the world. Quincey said: “Among those travelling from Ulster are three bands from Donegal, however another band joining them can make the unique claim of already having made that long journey not once but twice.” Portadown True Blues first marched in Toronto in  and then again in  when over  members of the band travelled over , miles to parade.Portadown True Blues on the march in their home town : -TONY HENDRONNNQuincey commented: “Over the decades that have past, relationships kindled during those trips have seen Canadian Brethren make their way back to the ‘home country’ to parade on the Twelfth in Portadown, and this year several of the True Blues who made that journey over  years ago will be ing the favour.”Sam Hill is part of the Portadown Trues Blues committee who are organising the band’s third trip to Toronto.The -year-old said: “This will be my first time in Toronto. The last time the band was there was  and I was still in the Army at the time.“The band over the years has been speaking about going back. “It’s a big financial commitment which made it dficult.“We actually got a special invite from the Canadians for the th anniversary because the band was there before in  and .“We discussed it last year and decidedwe were going we’d be taking the families and all with us.“It was thrown out to the general public as well to come with us and there’s some joining us, some of them are Orangemen. “It’s going to be a big trip.“We were up to  but a few have dropped out because of the coronavirus. We’re down to about  – three bus loads.“Everything is still going ahead as it stands. We’re just going on advice from our own government and Canadians. Canada haven’t got the same flight ban as the US.“We’ll have to sit tight and wait to hear. It could be a last minute decision.”Of the cost of the trip which has prompted a lot of fundraising from the band, Sam said:“It’s cost £, to get everybody there.“We’ve been on the ball with fundraising since August last year.“Now we’re into March and the marching season has started, we’re really looking forward to it.“We did sayeverybody paid their own fare to get there we would raise funds to offset the costs when we get there, to pay for things like buses for excursions. “Some of us are going for  days, the majority just going for a week.“I’m going with my we Sharon, my son and my daughter, I’ve got an older son who isn’t going.“There’s  fathers and sons going out of the band. With one family there’s three generations – Victor Graham is going with his son David and his grandchildren Sam and Bobby.“Aside from the parade they’ll have us playing in Orange halls, clubs and places like that. We’ll be trying to get a bit of freetime for sightseeing, Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, places like that.“There’s people who will be meeting up with family when they’re over.”Of the ‘old boys’ going on the trip Sam said: “There’s a few boys going that were there in  and .“We’ve actually a boy coming from New Zealand, Philip Currie. The plan is he’ll come back to Northern Ireland and travel with us.“Another boy Jimmy McCullough, who was there in , he lives in Las Vegas now, he’s coming up to meet us from there.“He still has his unorm. When he comes home he guests with the band.“Two of the boys who are still in the band – Nigel Morrison and Trevor Whitten – they’ll be there too.“It’s going to be a bit of a reunion as well.“We’ve been going through the band archive to see who was in the band at the time, we’ve been in contact with them.“The reason why we’re going back is it’s the th anniversary or the formation of the Orange over there. It’s the longest running parade in the history of North America.“Because it was the th anniversary and they did ask us back we thought now was the time to go.”In  Portadown True Blues became the first blood and thunder band to form in Portadown.The band was founded by three men - Connie Linton, Glen Yeman and the late Eddie McKinney. Their practice takes place in Clounagh Orange Hall.Sam, who has been in the band since , said: “The band has between  and  members, from primary school age up to older ones. Me and Johnny Burns are there the longest. Johnny has been there  years.“I’ve been secretary, I’ve been chairman, the whole lot. I’m just an ordinary band member now and I’m on the Canada sub committee.”Sam is joined on the True Blues Canada sub committee by band chairman Stephen Woods, Stuart Currie, Dickie Craven and Jamie Kerr.Orangeism was present in Canada less than  years after its formation in Co Armagh, with the first documented Lodge being active by  in the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec. Other lodges soon came into existence, but they were essentially all a loose confederation until  when the Grand Orange Lodge of British America was formed. The ‘father’ of the Canadian Order is widely regarded to be the controversial Wexford born Canadian politician and newspaper mogul Ogle Robert Gowan. Initially membership was made up of Irish immigrants, however its ethos soon saw it expand its remit to recruit heavily from English, Scottish and other Protestants from across Europe. In the th Century it could boast lodges made exclusively from those of Italian descent, and of Mohawk Indians. From a membership of approximately , in the mid-’s, by the early th century it had well over , brethren across several thousand lodges. In Newfoundland a third of adult males were members, making it more popular there than even back at ‘home’ in Ireland. Four Canadian prime ministers were members of the institution while numerous other brethren have served at other levels, with famously almost every Toronto mayor between  and  unashamedly Orange. Whilst the membership today is a pale reflection of its past glories, there are still thousands of Canadian Orangemen, and the ‘Orange Hall’ is still a part of the physical landscape.Toronto’s Orange presence was such that it was often called the ‘Belfast of Canada’ and although numbers are reduced the annual procession is the longest running in North America.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1584292147825.jpg--covid_19__update.jpg?158429214700","title":"covid  update ","story":"AS of pm on Sunday, March , testing has resulted in new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to.
