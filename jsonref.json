Among other things, they discussed what to do when news of the relationship became public – and Harry advised Mr Markle to avoid the paparazzi at all costs.Mr Markle recalled: ‘Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears. He said, “They will eat you alive.” He was right.’    Prince Harry (pictured) called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suitInstead of taking Harry’s advice, Mr Markle made a secret arrangement to pose for a series of pictures – a decision he now bitterly regrets. The photos made £100,000 for the photographer and a smaller amount for Mr Markle.On Friday, May 11, the MoS informed Kensington Palace of the revelations we were to publish two days later after we discovered CCTV footage of Mr Markle collaborating with the photographer.Harry called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suit.At this point, Mr Markle admits, he lied to the Prince.After our story appeared, Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack. Mr Markle said the Prince told him: ‘If you had listened to me this would never have happened’.Mr Markle said he told Harry: ‘Maybe it would be better for you guys if I was dead… then you could pretend to be sad.’‘Then I hung up.’In hindsight, he admits Harry was ‘absolutely right’ to criticise him. Yet it was Meghan who dealt perhaps the most painful blow when she told her father he would not be allowed to make a speech at the wedding. ‘That hurt,’ he said.Mr Markle added: ‘I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it.

London, reducing it to rubble save for the facade.Once completed, the lavish three-storey, four-bedroom house will also boast a state-of-the-art kitchen and dining area, a separate living room and a large study – and will be worth about £5 million. But they have faced setbacks since 2016 when neighbours objected to the building work, arguing the \u0027soul-less shells\u0027 would detract from the historic character of the area. The demolition has been underway for around a year, with a completion date yet to be finalised.  The dancer, her Australian hedge fund manager husband Angus Forbes, and their two teenage daughters, Phoebe and Zoe, originally moved into the house in 2014 after spending five years in Australia. According to reports, the 49-year-old and her family are renting a property nearby while they wait for their home to be finished.The property, originally built in 1920, is in a conservation area in south-west London, meaning the Strictly Come Dancing Judge has to keep the

During Hajj, pilgrims will spend five days praying in Mecca and in the surrounding desert.While Hajj is a demonstration of the togetherness of Islamic people and their devotion to their God Allah, the other pillars of the religion are Shahadah, the belief in God and the acceptance of Muhammad as prophet Salat, prayer Zakat, charity and Sawn, which is fasting.What is the Stoning of the Devil ritual?According to Birmingham Mail, during Hajj millions of pilgrims gather at the Jamarat Bridge which houses three columns representing the devil and Muslims will throw seven pebbles at the largest of the columns.This act, which is referred to as Jamarat, takes place in the position where Ibrahim is thought to have done the same to frighten off the Devil after Allah had told him to sacrifice his son as a proof of faith and this is spot is where the Devil appeared to dissuade him from doing as Allah had asked.The Stoning of the Devil ritual occurs on the third day, which is also known as yawm-ul hajj al-akbar and is the longest day of pilgrimage, as well as the most dangerous. This is also when Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice, also takes place.          Muslim pilgrims around the Kaaba located in the centre of the Haram Sharif Great MosqueJamarat Bridge redesignAlthough the Jamarat Bridge was constructed in 1963, due to an increasing number of pilgrims visiting the site, the Saudi Arabian government decided to demolish the original structure in 2006 and start building the bridge from scratch.Birmingham Mail reported that before the upgrade, crowd density could reach up to 11-15 people per square metre at peak times, but local officials revealed that now there is one square metre per person. The new bridge also has five levels, hundreds of escalators, several lifts, two helipads and air conditioning.Otis Middle East’s Vice President and Managing Director Maged Nagib said: ‘With something this vital to Muslims worldwide, it is vital that outside factors do not disturb the true meaning of Hajj. The reconstruction of the Jamarat Bridge was an important step forward in terms of safety during the pilgrimage.’When is Hajj 2018?Typically the Hajj is a five-day pilgrimage that takes place from the 8th to the 12th day of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th and final month of the Islamic calendar. In 2018, Hajj will begin on Sunday, August 19 and continue until Friday, August 24.However, like all celebrations in the Muslim calendar, the event start will be determined by the sighting of the moon, which will in turn, reveals the date of Dhul-Hijjah and Eid Al-Adha.

Tony Benn served as an RAF officer, and Jim Callaghan in the Royal Navy. But Corbyn is completely orced from this tradition.From London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this articleThe exposure of his Tunisian escapade in 2014 is just the latest in this unedifying pattern, but the incident is beyond the pale. The 1972 Munich attack was one of the darkest episodes in modern history. It is deeply worrying to know that a man at the top level of public life in Britain felt, only four years ago, that he should attend such an event.What is almost as reprehensible is the attempt by Corbyn and his team to mislead the British public, once the investigation was published. At first his office engaged in the simple tactic of denial.          The Labour leader (pictured on Sky News today on a visit to the Midlands) faced the cameras after a photograph of him holding a wreath near the graves of Palestinian activists linked to the 1972 Munich massacre - which left 11 Israelis dead, emerged. He said he attended a ceremony in Tunis in 2014 because he wanted to commemorate all those killed in atrocitiesAccording to this narrative, the story was a \u0027smear,\u0027 \u0027fake news\u0027 and a \u0027hoax.\u0027 But the weight of evidence made this impossible to sustain. Not only were there photographs of Corbyn holding a wreath near the memorial to the terrorists, but he had also boasted about his attendance at the event in his column in the Morning Star, a communist newspaper.Confronted with this material, Corbyn resorted in interviews yesterday to more prevarication, arguing that he was present at the commemoration but \u0027I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it.\u0027 Such a form of words would be laughable were it not so serious.The Tunisian debacle may be appalling, but sadly, it is no longer shocking. As the MP for Islington North since 1983, Corbyn has been behaving like this throughout his Parliamentary career.When he was an obscure backbencher and serial far-left rebel, his conduct was not so important. But now, he is the Opposition Leader, and exposure of his past is vital. This is a man whose leadership, in less than three years, has not put an end to the vile anti-semitism flourishing within his party, not least because of his own hostility to Israel.Corbyn has regularly shown contempt for the state of Israel, not just its government and its policies, such as in 2010 when he used the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day to host an explosively controversial meeting in Westminster at which nauseating comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany were loudly voiced, something the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) describes as clearly anti-semitic.In 2010 he told a crowd of protestors outside the Israeli Embassy that the position of Gaza was similar to the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the Russian resistance to Nazism in the Second World War. In 2013, he compared Israel\u0027s actions in the West Bank to the Nazi occupation of Europe in World War Two.In the same disreputable vein, in 2012 he used Facebook to express his support for a work in East London by graffiti artist Mear One, who had painted a clearly anti-semitic mural of Jewish plutocrats exploiting the poor.Corbyn told the artist he was \u0027in good company\u0027, a remark for which he later apologised. But precious few other apologies have been forthcoming from Corbyn, not even over his description of the anti-semitic terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u0027our friends\u0027 at an event in Westminster in 2009.Much to the incandescent fury of respected MPs like Margaret Hodge – who lost several members of her own family in the Holocaust – Corbyn\u0027s team has refused to write the globally accepted definition of anti-semitism drawn up by the IHRA into Labour\u0027s rulebook.It is an unbelievable situation in a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice. Indeed, Corbyn likes to portray himself as a passionate warrior against discrimination, but his deeds hardly match his words.           Jeremy Corbyn is pictured with members of a delegation of Palestinian officials at the graveyard in Tunis in 2014, with the wreath which was laid in the cemetery to honour Palestinian \u0027martyrs\u0027.  He has admitted being at the ceremony after initially insisting he was there for a tribute to different PalestiniansHe has been painfully slow to speak out against the anti-semitic abuse meted out to some of his own Labour MPs, like Luciana Berger, by hard-left activists.This is beyond normal Party politics, as this is an issue far beyond the traditional, century-long battle between Conservatives and Labour. I remember the Labour party of old and it saddens me to see it in this state. Thanks to Corbyn\u0027s leadership, decent, moderate Labour activists and MPs are in complete despair at what is happening at the very top of the Labour party.Yet it is only Labour that can sort out this problem. How much longer is the party going to put up with a leader who obfuscates about his past, who equivocates about anti-semitism, who lambasted the BBC for \u0027bias\u0027 for saying Israel has the right to exist, who refuses to be accountable for his actions and who will not even defend his own MPs and members from racist abuse?At such a crucial time for Britain\u0027s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.For the sake of democracy and decency in public life, decent members of the Labour party must ask, is this man fit to lead them and to be leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition?  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/21/4F13040C00000578-0-image-m-46_1534191996763.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyns confusing inconsistent account DID happen wreath laying event","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, pictured here leaving his home yesterday, has given a confusing and contradictory account of his visit to the Tunisian cemetery where the terrorists linked to the Munich Massacre are buriedFrom London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this article    Labour has insisted Jeremy Corbyn (pictured, holding his hands aloft in what appears to be him observing a Muslim prayer with the delegation at the cemetery in 2014) was there to pay his respects to the victims of an Israeli bombing raid in 1985, and not extremists linked to the massacre11:10pm, Sunday August 12, 2018After the widows of Munich victims condemned Mr Corbyn in a front-page Daily Mail story Labour tweets: \u0027The widows are being misled.\u002712:30pm, Monday August 13, 2018Mr Corbyn told ITV News: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some … for those who were killed in Paris in 1992.

Mr Corbyn appears to be adjusting the wreath, which is being held by Salman El Herfi, the Palestinian ambassador in Tunisia. He is still standing by the graves of the men linked to the terror attackOn another dramatic day yesterday:Families of Israeli athletes killed in the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre called on Mr Corbyn to apologise and step down as Labour leader.It emerged that the Stop the War campaign group published an incendiary article playing down the brutal killings as unintentional while Mr Corbyn was its chairman.The BBC largely ignored the revelations about Mr Corbyn\u0027s visit to the graves of the Black September terrorists – while giving extensive coverage to the week-old row about Boris Johnson\u0027s burka remarks.Mr Netanyahu criticised Mr Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony where a wreath was laid in memory of Palestinians suspected of being behind the Munich Olympics massacre.The Israeli PM accused the Labour leader of laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the 1972 atrocity in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed, after photos published by the Mail on Saturday showed him holding the floral tribute at the foot of the memorial.          Jeremy Corbyn raises his hands in what appears to be an Islamic prayer position as he stands beside other politicians. A source said he was not praying but \u0027copying the others out of respect\u0027Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: \u0027The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – Left, Right and everything in between.\u0027The second reference was to a video which surfaced last week which appeared to show Mr Corbyn likening the situation in the West Bank to occupations during the Second World War.Soon after Mr Netanyahu\u0027s tweet, however, Mr Corbyn hit back. He wrote on Twitter: \u0027Israeli PM @Netanyahu\u0027s claims about my actions and words are false. \u0027What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.\u0027The Labour leader then tweeted: \u0027The nation state law sponsored by Netanyahu\u0027s government discriminates against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority.           Mr Corbyn looks at a plaque which honours Khalaf, al-Omari and Abdel-Hamid.

It\u0027s as though they expect people to knock on the door and thank them for their generosity.What that \u0027Please Take\u0027 note is apparently supposed to imply is: \u0027Lord Muck and Lady Bountiful live here. We no longer need these articles from our less affluent youth. If you\u0027re in need, and unlike us you cannot afford to buy beautiful new furniture, by all means do yourselves a favour.\u0027          Out of tune: In my home town of Bristol, it has become an epidemic. The rubbish can sit there for days, sometimes weeks (Above, a broken piano \u0027free\u0027 to a good home) I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy. They can\u0027t be bothered to go to the tip. Instead, they expect you to make their lives easier by providing a free rubbish clearance service. They should be ashamed, but they\u0027ve deluded themselves that they are better people for it. They are, in short, middle-class fly-tippers.\u0027These self-righteous local nuisances might think there\u0027s no harm in what they\u0027re doing, but there\u0027s no such thing as harmless junk.          Any takers? These smug litterbugs pretend they\u0027re doing a community service by offering their detritus for free (Above, a selection of items offered outside a home in south east London) Unwanted items seem to call out to local yobs and vandals.

Their legs were scuffed and the purple cushions had seen better days, but there wasn\u0027t a lot wrong with them.          Free to a good home? I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy\u0027 (Above, Christopher Stevens) During the night, they inevitably migrated to the lane beside my house. It\u0027s a busy shortcut to the main road and, after the pubs close, just about anything small enough to lift — most often bikes or knackered scooters — is likely to make its way there.These purple chairs were placed at right angles to each other, behind my garden fence. The ground was scattered with cigarette butts and a couple of crushed beer cans. It looked like the people who took them had sat there for quite a while.I don\u0027t want the lane turning into an alfresco nightclub. And I\u0027m certainly not keen on anything being left that might be used as a makeshift step-ladder next to my fence. There are enough break-ins in Bristol without giving the burglars a leg-up.True, I could take them back to the house round the corner, but they\u0027ll only end up on the street again. Once a dining suite has hit the skids, there\u0027s no way back.If I had all the time in the world, I might find a local charity and donate the chairs to be \u0027free-cycled\u0027 — given to someone who could genuinely use this tat. It\u0027s hard to think who that could be, though, given that the era in which the poor kissed the hands of the gentry in thanks for their cast-offs ended with Queen Victoria.                            Middle-class fly-tipping is really about saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead                        I can\u0027t put the chairs in a wheelie bin without incurring a hefty fine, and the council will charge me £15 if I want to have them collected. There is an online \u0027freecycling exchange\u0027 in Bristol but it doesn\u0027t seem to be very active.So this morning it falls to me to sling these wretched chairs in the back of the car, along with a broken strimmer and some plastic waste I\u0027ve been meaning to jettison for ages, and take them to the tip — or, to use its proper title, the St Philips Household Waste Recycling Centre.In other words, I\u0027ll end up doing exactly what the owner of the chairs should have done in the first place. I\u0027m saving him the trouble.This cuts to the heart of what middle-class fly-tipping is really about: saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead. It\u0027s not dumping rubbish: it\u0027s dumping a problem.It\u0027s why people pile tatty paperbacks and children\u0027s picture books by the garden gate, with a sign that says: \u0027Help yourself, happy reading!\u0027           Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shopAnyone who genuinely wanted their dog-eared Harry Potters to give entertainment to a new generation would take half an hour and go to the nearest charity bookshop — there are at least a dozen within a mile of my house.Instead, people just strew their driveway with heaps of books and plastic toys, making the street look like an unattended car boot sale. Even if it rains, the books stay there for days, quietly rotting.Sometimes, the middle-class fly-tipper isn\u0027t even generous enough to give away their rubbish.Earlier this year I came upon a lounge unit of drawers and shelves, with a table for a TV, propped up against the wall of a house. A scrawled sign said, \u0027£25 or nearest offer\u0027.The Formica was stained with tea-mug rings and peeled back to expose frayed chipboard at the corners. The whole contraption tilted sideways, as if it were too exhausted to stand up straight. No one in their right mind would pay £25 for a stranger\u0027s scrap.                            Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop                        If anyone\u0027s to blame for the rise of the middle-class fly-tipper, it\u0027s Kirstie Allsopp. She\u0027s not actually middle-class, by the way — she\u0027s the daughter of a hereditary peer, the sixth Baron Hindlip. But she did popularise the craze for foisting worn-out furniture on people, with a TV show about \u0027upcycling\u0027 called Fill Your House For Free.Kirstie\u0027s scheme was to take sagging sofas and decrepit kitchen cupboards, give them a lick of paint and pretend they were lovely. She broke a painter\u0027s stepladder in two and nailed it to the wall as a pair of wonky shelves. A rusty barbecue pan, sprayed gold, became a lampshade.Stupidest of all, she had a tradesman saw an iron bath in two. When he had glued a couple of cushions into one end, Kirstie announced it was \u0027an upcycled easy-chair\u0027.Reviewing the show for my Mail TV column four years ago, I pointed out this was sheer pretension. Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop.Kirstie and her trendy tribe of \u0027upcyclers\u0027 have given a licence to lazy middle-class house-holders to dump their junk on the street and feel they\u0027ve done the world a favour.So here\u0027s a message for them all. I don\u0027t want your old furniture. And neither does anyone else. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/11/4F103CDB00000578-0-image-m-16_1534155917744.jpg","title":"Tenants able buy one cent home year new proposals","story":"    Tenants will be able to buy tiny shares of their home every year to build up a nest egg over time, ministers will announce today (file photo)The minister said: ‘Providing high-quality and well-managed social housing is a core priority for this Government.‘Our green paper offers a landmark opportunity for major reform to improve fairness, quality and safety for residents living in social housing across the country.

Tony Benn served as an RAF officer, and Jim Callaghan in the Royal Navy. But Corbyn is completely orced from this tradition.From London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this articleThe exposure of his Tunisian escapade in 2014 is just the latest in this unedifying pattern, but the incident is beyond the pale. The 1972 Munich attack was one of the darkest episodes in modern history. It is deeply worrying to know that a man at the top level of public life in Britain felt, only four years ago, that he should attend such an event.What is almost as reprehensible is the attempt by Corbyn and his team to mislead the British public, once the investigation was published. At first his office engaged in the simple tactic of denial.          The Labour leader (pictured on Sky News today on a visit to the Midlands) faced the cameras after a photograph of him holding a wreath near the graves of Palestinian activists linked to the 1972 Munich massacre - which left 11 Israelis dead, emerged. He said he attended a ceremony in Tunis in 2014 because he wanted to commemorate all those killed in atrocitiesAccording to this narrative, the story was a \u0027smear,\u0027 \u0027fake news\u0027 and a \u0027hoax.\u0027 But the weight of evidence made this impossible to sustain. Not only were there photographs of Corbyn holding a wreath near the memorial to the terrorists, but he had also boasted about his attendance at the event in his column in the Morning Star, a communist newspaper.Confronted with this material, Corbyn resorted in interviews yesterday to more prevarication, arguing that he was present at the commemoration but \u0027I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it.\u0027 Such a form of words would be laughable were it not so serious.The Tunisian debacle may be appalling, but sadly, it is no longer shocking. As the MP for Islington North since 1983, Corbyn has been behaving like this throughout his Parliamentary career.When he was an obscure backbencher and serial far-left rebel, his conduct was not so important. But now, he is the Opposition Leader, and exposure of his past is vital. This is a man whose leadership, in less than three years, has not put an end to the vile anti-semitism flourishing within his party, not least because of his own hostility to Israel.Corbyn has regularly shown contempt for the state of Israel, not just its government and its policies, such as in 2010 when he used the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day to host an explosively controversial meeting in Westminster at which nauseating comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany were loudly voiced, something the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) describes as clearly anti-semitic.In 2010 he told a crowd of protestors outside the Israeli Embassy that the position of Gaza was similar to the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the Russian resistance to Nazism in the Second World War. In 2013, he compared Israel\u0027s actions in the West Bank to the Nazi occupation of Europe in World War Two.In the same disreputable vein, in 2012 he used Facebook to express his support for a work in East London by graffiti artist Mear One, who had painted a clearly anti-semitic mural of Jewish plutocrats exploiting the poor.Corbyn told the artist he was \u0027in good company\u0027, a remark for which he later apologised. But precious few other apologies have been forthcoming from Corbyn, not even over his description of the anti-semitic terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u0027our friends\u0027 at an event in Westminster in 2009.Much to the incandescent fury of respected MPs like Margaret Hodge – who lost several members of her own family in the Holocaust – Corbyn\u0027s team has refused to write the globally accepted definition of anti-semitism drawn up by the IHRA into Labour\u0027s rulebook.It is an unbelievable situation in a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice. Indeed, Corbyn likes to portray himself as a passionate warrior against discrimination, but his deeds hardly match his words.           Jeremy Corbyn is pictured with members of a delegation of Palestinian officials at the graveyard in Tunis in 2014, with the wreath which was laid in the cemetery to honour Palestinian \u0027martyrs\u0027.  He has admitted being at the ceremony after initially insisting he was there for a tribute to different PalestiniansHe has been painfully slow to speak out against the anti-semitic abuse meted out to some of his own Labour MPs, like Luciana Berger, by hard-left activists.This is beyond normal Party politics, as this is an issue far beyond the traditional, century-long battle between Conservatives and Labour. I remember the Labour party of old and it saddens me to see it in this state. Thanks to Corbyn\u0027s leadership, decent, moderate Labour activists and MPs are in complete despair at what is happening at the very top of the Labour party.Yet it is only Labour that can sort out this problem. How much longer is the party going to put up with a leader who obfuscates about his past, who equivocates about anti-semitism, who lambasted the BBC for \u0027bias\u0027 for saying Israel has the right to exist, who refuses to be accountable for his actions and who will not even defend his own MPs and members from racist abuse?At such a crucial time for Britain\u0027s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.For the sake of democracy and decency in public life, decent members of the Labour party must ask, is this man fit to lead them and to be leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition?  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/21/4F13040C00000578-0-image-m-46_1534191996763.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyns confusing inconsistent account DID happen wreath laying event","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, pictured here leaving his home yesterday, has given a confusing and contradictory account of his visit to the Tunisian cemetery where the terrorists linked to the Munich Massacre are buriedFrom London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this article    Labour has insisted Jeremy Corbyn (pictured, holding his hands aloft in what appears to be him observing a Muslim prayer with the delegation at the cemetery in 2014) was there to pay his respects to the victims of an Israeli bombing raid in 1985, and not extremists linked to the massacre11:10pm, Sunday August 12, 2018After the widows of Munich victims condemned Mr Corbyn in a front-page Daily Mail story Labour tweets: \u0027The widows are being misled.\u002712:30pm, Monday August 13, 2018Mr Corbyn told ITV News: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some … for those who were killed in Paris in 1992.

Mr Corbyn appears to be adjusting the wreath, which is being held by Salman El Herfi, the Palestinian ambassador in Tunisia. He is still standing by the graves of the men linked to the terror attackOn another dramatic day yesterday:Families of Israeli athletes killed in the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre called on Mr Corbyn to apologise and step down as Labour leader.It emerged that the Stop the War campaign group published an incendiary article playing down the brutal killings as unintentional while Mr Corbyn was its chairman.The BBC largely ignored the revelations about Mr Corbyn\u0027s visit to the graves of the Black September terrorists – while giving extensive coverage to the week-old row about Boris Johnson\u0027s burka remarks.Mr Netanyahu criticised Mr Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony where a wreath was laid in memory of Palestinians suspected of being behind the Munich Olympics massacre.The Israeli PM accused the Labour leader of laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the 1972 atrocity in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed, after photos published by the Mail on Saturday showed him holding the floral tribute at the foot of the memorial.          Jeremy Corbyn raises his hands in what appears to be an Islamic prayer position as he stands beside other politicians. A source said he was not praying but \u0027copying the others out of respect\u0027Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: \u0027The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – Left, Right and everything in between.\u0027The second reference was to a video which surfaced last week which appeared to show Mr Corbyn likening the situation in the West Bank to occupations during the Second World War.Soon after Mr Netanyahu\u0027s tweet, however, Mr Corbyn hit back. He wrote on Twitter: \u0027Israeli PM @Netanyahu\u0027s claims about my actions and words are false. \u0027What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.\u0027The Labour leader then tweeted: \u0027The nation state law sponsored by Netanyahu\u0027s government discriminates against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority.           Mr Corbyn looks at a plaque which honours Khalaf, al-Omari and Abdel-Hamid. It describes them as ‘martyrs’ who were assassinated in 1991. A wreath that looks very similar to the one Mr Corbyn was holding in the earlier two photographs is seen beside the plaque, circled \u0027I stand with the tens of thousands of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel demonstrating for equal rights at the weekend in Tel Aviv.\u0027Earlier, Mr Corbyn had finally been forced to address the growing row during a visit to Walsall, but his attempt to calm the situation served only to inflame it. Asked about the controversy, Mr Corbyn said: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended the conference to those that were killed in Paris in 1992.\u0027I was present when it was laid. I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it (laying it). I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it.\u0027Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger last night hit back at Mr Corbyn\u0027s attempted explanation.           The Israeli PM condemned Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter and urged those of the left and right to unite to in criticising the Labour leader           Mr Corbyn has hit back at Mr Netanyahu\u0027s claims, calling them \u0027false\u0027 on Twitter          Mr Corbyn also blasted the Israeli PM for laws sponsored by his government that \u0027discriminate against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority\u0027      \u0027We hope that all Labour MPs, members and those in the media will show the integrity that this case demands and continue to hold Mr Corbyn to account over this appalling incident.\u0027 Jennifer Gerber, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said: \u0027Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s latest statement is a further insult to those savagely murdered at Munich and their bereaved relatives.\u0027He says he was paying respect to victims of terrorism when there is clear photographic evidence of him holding a wreath.

If you\u0027re in need, and unlike us you cannot afford to buy beautiful new furniture, by all means do yourselves a favour.\u0027          Out of tune: In my home town of Bristol, it has become an epidemic. The rubbish can sit there for days, sometimes weeks (Above, a broken piano \u0027free\u0027 to a good home) I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy. They can\u0027t be bothered to go to the tip. Instead, they expect you to make their lives easier by providing a free rubbish clearance service. They should be ashamed, but they\u0027ve deluded themselves that they are better people for it. They are, in short, middle-class fly-tippers.\u0027These self-righteous local nuisances might think there\u0027s no harm in what they\u0027re doing, but there\u0027s no such thing as harmless junk.          Any takers? These smug litterbugs pretend they\u0027re doing a community service by offering their detritus for free (Above, a selection of items offered outside a home in south east London) Unwanted items seem to call out to local yobs and vandals.

Their legs were scuffed and the purple cushions had seen better days, but there wasn\u0027t a lot wrong with them.          Free to a good home? I read it differently. What I see is: \u0027To all passers-by: the people in this house are cheap and lazy\u0027 (Above, Christopher Stevens) During the night, they inevitably migrated to the lane beside my house. It\u0027s a busy shortcut to the main road and, after the pubs close, just about anything small enough to lift — most often bikes or knackered scooters — is likely to make its way there.These purple chairs were placed at right angles to each other, behind my garden fence. The ground was scattered with cigarette butts and a couple of crushed beer cans. It looked like the people who took them had sat there for quite a while.I don\u0027t want the lane turning into an alfresco nightclub. And I\u0027m certainly not keen on anything being left that might be used as a makeshift step-ladder next to my fence. There are enough break-ins in Bristol without giving the burglars a leg-up.True, I could take them back to the house round the corner, but they\u0027ll only end up on the street again. Once a dining suite has hit the skids, there\u0027s no way back.If I had all the time in the world, I might find a local charity and donate the chairs to be \u0027free-cycled\u0027 — given to someone who could genuinely use this tat. It\u0027s hard to think who that could be, though, given that the era in which the poor kissed the hands of the gentry in thanks for their cast-offs ended with Queen Victoria.                            Middle-class fly-tipping is really about saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead                        I can\u0027t put the chairs in a wheelie bin without incurring a hefty fine, and the council will charge me £15 if I want to have them collected. There is an online \u0027freecycling exchange\u0027 in Bristol but it doesn\u0027t seem to be very active.So this morning it falls to me to sling these wretched chairs in the back of the car, along with a broken strimmer and some plastic waste I\u0027ve been meaning to jettison for ages, and take them to the tip — or, to use its proper title, the St Philips Household Waste Recycling Centre.In other words, I\u0027ll end up doing exactly what the owner of the chairs should have done in the first place. I\u0027m saving him the trouble.This cuts to the heart of what middle-class fly-tipping is really about: saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead. It\u0027s not dumping rubbish: it\u0027s dumping a problem.It\u0027s why people pile tatty paperbacks and children\u0027s picture books by the garden gate, with a sign that says: \u0027Help yourself, happy reading!\u0027           Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shopAnyone who genuinely wanted their dog-eared Harry Potters to give entertainment to a new generation would take half an hour and go to the nearest charity bookshop — there are at least a dozen within a mile of my house.Instead, people just strew their driveway with heaps of books and plastic toys, making the street look like an unattended car boot sale. Even if it rains, the books stay there for days, quietly rotting.Sometimes, the middle-class fly-tipper isn\u0027t even generous enough to give away their rubbish.Earlier this year I came upon a lounge unit of drawers and shelves, with a table for a TV, propped up against the wall of a house. A scrawled sign said, \u0027£25 or nearest offer\u0027.The Formica was stained with tea-mug rings and peeled back to expose frayed chipboard at the corners. The whole contraption tilted sideways, as if it were too exhausted to stand up straight. No one in their right mind would pay £25 for a stranger\u0027s scrap.                            Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop                        If anyone\u0027s to blame for the rise of the middle-class fly-tipper, it\u0027s Kirstie Allsopp. She\u0027s not actually middle-class, by the way — she\u0027s the daughter of a hereditary peer, the sixth Baron Hindlip. But she did popularise the craze for foisting worn-out furniture on people, with a TV show about \u0027upcycling\u0027 called Fill Your House For Free.Kirstie\u0027s scheme was to take sagging sofas and decrepit kitchen cupboards, give them a lick of paint and pretend they were lovely. She broke a painter\u0027s stepladder in two and nailed it to the wall as a pair of wonky shelves. A rusty barbecue pan, sprayed gold, became a lampshade.Stupidest of all, she had a tradesman saw an iron bath in two. When he had glued a couple of cushions into one end, Kirstie announced it was \u0027an upcycled easy-chair\u0027.Reviewing the show for my Mail TV column four years ago, I pointed out this was sheer pretension. Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop.Kirstie and her trendy tribe of \u0027upcyclers\u0027 have given a licence to lazy middle-class house-holders to dump their junk on the street and feel they\u0027ve done the world a favour.So here\u0027s a message for them all. I don\u0027t want your old furniture. And neither does anyone else. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/14/08/4F14676B00000578-6058241-image-a-1_1534231659321.jpg","title":"Cheetah sits open sun roof poses incredible safari photo","story":"    Leilani, 13, was brave enough to pose for a photo with a cheetah who jumped on their jeep in Serengeti          The predator lay in the shade and sat comfortably with its paw through the window while the frightened family stared in disbeliefThe cat, who pants and flops his paw comfortably through the window, appeared to be more concerned about keeping himself in the shade than by the frightened family staring back at them.The camera panned around the group who  laugh nervously in disbelief at the once-in-a-lifetime encounter with the cheetah.A mother’s pride: Lioness leads her cubs down to waterhole...Share this article A fearless tour guide immediately takes his phone out to snap some photos and says \u0027it\u0027s a selfie!\u0027Thirteen-year-old Leilani came face-to-face with the predator as she neared close to the wild cat to have her photo taken.

It said it would take legal measures against them but did not say what these would be.Separately, the Istanbul and Ankara prosecutor\u0027s offices launched investigations into iniduals suspected of being involved in actions that threaten Turkey\u0027s economic security, broadcaster CNN Turk and state news agency Anadolu reported.Turkey\u0027s Capital Markets Board (SPK) and financial crime board have also said they would take legal steps against those who spread misinformation about financial institutions and firms, or reports that the government would seize foreign-currency deposits.

Has the time come to turn it off?Once, when I was staying in Houston, Texas, my host was showing me round her house. It included a mighty fireplace.“How often does it get cold enough to light a fire?” I asked, as what little I knew about the city included the fact that it is mostly hot and humid. Maybe once or twice a year, she replied, but her husband came from Wisconsin. He liked a log fire. So they would turn up the air conditioning and light one.This was climate as television, to be summoned with the twiddle of a dial, the outcome of a century which started in 1902, when Willis Carrier was simply asked to find a way to prevent heat and humidity from warping the paper at the Brooklyn printing company Sackett-Wilhelms. But the air-conditioning that he helped develop has changed buildings, and the ways they are used, more than any other invention: more than reinforced concrete, plate glass, safety elevators or steel frames. Its effects have directed the locations and shapes of cities. They have been social, cultural and geopolitical.The shopping mall would have been inconceivable without air conditioning, as would the deep-plan and glass-walled office block, as would computer servers. The rise of Hollywood in the 1920s would have been slowed if, as previously, theatres had needed to close in hot weather. The expansion of tract housing in postwar suburban America relied on affordable domestic air conditioning units. A contemporary museum, such as Tate Modern or Moma, requires a carefully controlled climate to protect the works of art.There are, of course, other factors, such as the presence of oil reserves in both Houston and the Gulf, but the mitigation of otherwise unbearable temperatures radically changed the way the stories of these cities played out. And so, in the 21st century, we reached the point where a ski-slope with “real” snow could be built in a Dubai shopping mall and air-conditioned football stadiums could be planned for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, epics of refrigeration whose USP was their outrageous – and hitherto unfeasible – inversion of nature.With air conditioning goes a new kind of architecture, one in which traditional hot-climate devices such as porches, cross-ventilation or pools of water, which create both layers and permeability between inside and out, have given way to sealed boxes. Persian wind-catching towers, or the fountains of the Alhambra, or the humble dogtrot house of the southern US, in which living and cooking quarters are separated by a passage open to the breeze, all proceeded by negotiation between built fabric and the environment. Now it is a matter of technological conquest.Building services – their heating, cooling and ventilating systems – came to eat up larger proportions of their total budgets. The people who designed them, services engineers, became influential if underacknowledged officers in the shaping of cities. By the 1980s, buildings such as Richard Rogers’ Lloyds building gave formal expression to the ducts and extracts that until then had been hidden. In the Die Hard movies they become a crucial setting of suspense and action, being large enough to accommodate the body of Bruce Willis.The most significant architectural effect of air conditioning, however, is in the social spaces it creates. In Houston, as in most southern American cities, you can progress from your air-conditioned house to your air-conditioned garage and then in your air-conditioned car to parking garages, malls and workplaces which are all, also, air-conditioned. In the city’s downtown area, underpasses and bridges link different buildings, so that you can go from one to another without exposing yourself to the exterior. It is possible, indeed habitual, to spend whole days and weeks in controlled weather.In the brutal climate of Doha, Qatar (or indeed in Dubai, Shenzhen or Singapore) similar spaces recur. Buildings which appear separate from the outside (for the few, that is, who choose to be outside) are internally fused, a hotel turning into a mall into a food court into a multiplex via a series of lobbies whose décor of marble, carpet and timber veneer can’t decide if it is internal or external. The hierarchies and distinctions of European cities – between buildings and streets, and between degrees of public and private space – are bypassed and dissolved.The architect Rem Koolhaas called this phenomenon “Junkspace”, a “product of the encounter between escalator and air conditioning, conceived in an incubator of sheetrock … always interior, so extensive that you rarely perceive limits.” In the Gulf and China as in much of the US, the mall became the principal gathering place, being a zone where large numbers could comfortably pass their time, leaving streets to be occupied by air conditioning’s mechanical ally, the automobile.The result is a form of sensory deprivation that almost everyone now accepts without question, in which the active interplay of body and atmosphere becomes homogenised and passive. The stimuli of scent, touch, sound and sight are almost entirely at the discretion of the mall management: “a low grade purgatory”, as Koolhaas called it, “overripe and undernourishing at the same time … like being condemned to a perpetual jacuzzi with millions of your best friends.”There is also an absence of what a European might consider public space, that is somewhere in principle available to everyone, open to activities both unprogrammed and not necessarily retail. It has been observed that the climate-controlled networks of Houston or Jakarta or Dubai can serve not only to exclude heat and humidity, but also those considered undesirable or insufficiently profitable. In such places there is a clear ide, social and often racial, between those inside the conditioned cocoon and those outside. The street becomes actively hostile, the effects of weather compounded by those of motor traffic and indifference to the needs of pedestrians. Here are the people you don’t see in the malls – the blue-uniformed migrant workers in the Gulf, the homeless and luckless in America.Environmentally speaking, air conditioning is anti-social. It buys its owner comfort at the cost of shifting the surplus heat somewhere else, on to surrounding streets and ultimately into the atmosphere of the planet. The night-time temperature of Phoenix, Arizona, is believed to be increased by one degree or more by the heat expelled from its air conditioning. This is, you could say, the perfectly neoliberal technology, based on ision and displacement. According to one theory, air conditioning helped to elect Ronald Reagan, by attracting conservatively inclined retirees to the southern states that swung in his favour.In pointing out the shortcomings of air conditioning, it is easy to overlook its achievements, to ask, in the style of Life of Brian, what it ever did for us. Considerable reductions in the loss of life through excess heat is one answer. Increased productivity and economic activity in hot regions of the world is another. Or better-functioning hospitals and schools. Most of us would be grateful for its contribution to computing and movies. Few people who have spent time in hot and humid climates would not sometimes want the refuge of artificially cooled air.One defence of air-conditioned cities is that they are more energy-efficient than very cold cities – Minneapolis, for example – that need to be heated up in winter, and if the statistics of energy consumption sound terrifying, they can also be put in perspective. The US expends more energy on air conditioning, for example, than the whole of Africa does on everything. Then again, it expends even more energy on hot water, which doesn’t get the same rap.If these principles are now better known, the challenge remains to expand the village-scale achievements of an architect like Hassan Fathy to large, fast-growing cities. Addressing this challenge is the promise of high-profile, government-backed projects such as Msheireb in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, which boast of their combinations of old forms – shady courtyards and arcades narrow, breezy streets – with solar panel arrays and what Masdar’s architects, Foster and Partners, call “state-of-the-art technologies”.There has been some scepticism, about Masdar in particular, that these projects’ purposes might be more symbolic than truly environmental. But the places they create are incomparably more pleasurable than the downtowns, mechanised by cars and air-conditioning, of the cities in which they are placed. They are, at least, steps forward in what is an essential task for the 21st century: to develop new forms of public space in hot climates, not the city-scaled habitable fridges of the 20th.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

It would be a neat historical symmetry if the country voted on a reversal because Jeremy Corbyn faced the same problem with Labour.A referendum on Brexit terms is not Labour policy. In March, Owen Smith was sacked as shadow Northern Ireland secretary for saying it should be. But nuance has crept on to the frontbench since then. “We’ve not ruled anything out,” John McDonnell said in July. “But our preference is a general election.”That preference flows from three calculations. First, the collision between Theresa May’s Brexit deal and parliament this autumn will be so gruesome that the prime minister will fall. Second, that her departure will somehow propel Corbyn into Downing Street. Third, that the Brexit process will as a result be magically detoxified. All peril comes from Tory rule and ends when Labour’s crack team rides into the breach. Each of those judgments are debatable the last one is delusional.Corbyn fought the 2017 election on a pro-Brexit manifesto, yet his campaign scooped up millions of disoriented remainers. Opposition strategists concluded that the pro-European vote was a subset of anti-Tory feeling, which was – in England – owned by Labour. They worried more about pro-leave voters needing reassurance that Brexit would not be undone.A lot has happened since last June. The idea of a gentle separation from the continent has died. Brexiters are ided now only on the question of whether to minimise the pain or embrace it as a purgative procedure to fortify the nation’s soul. It is thus rational for anyone else to want annulment of the whole mismanaged enterprise on the menu. That option is especially popular among Labour members, whose pro-European ardour is stirred by every glimpse of Brexit’s ugly nationalist underbelly.Corbyn’s allergy to discussion of a Brexit reversal once looked tactically astute. Now it looks shifty. It compounds the impression of leadership unmoored. The row over antisemitism that has consumed Labour this summer is a mess of complex genesis on the far left, but the situation is made worse by general stagnation. The noxious miasma grows denser over a party that can’t seem to move forward on any front. It doesn’t even have anything useful to say on the biggest issue facing the country.This Euro-stasis is the expression of deadlocked forces that do not map on to pro- or anti-Corbyn faultlines. The alliance that wants to press on with Brexit unites the “old Labour” right, who fret about immigration control, with the “old Labour” left, which hates the EU’s legal framework for competition and free markets.The rival coalition is a fragile compound of unrepentant Blairites, who focus on the economic folly of quitting the single market, and the younger radicals in Momentum, who see Brexit opening a portal to an “alt-right” hellscape where Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg perform endless Donald Trump tributes.Pro-EU outriders in Momentum and anxious unions are nudging a referendum up Labour’s agenda. To help the lobbying effort, campaigners for the People’s Vote, the pro-plebiscite umbrella organisation, refrain from public criticism of Corbyn. No one anticipates a dramatic U-turn, but there is cautious optimism that the door to a policy shift, now barely ajar, will open a bit wider at this year’s annual conference.The obstacles are time and dogmatic tribalism at the very top. Corbyn’s closest allies don’t trust anyone who hasn’t always been around, alongside Jeremy on the long march through the wilderness. (The ledger of loyalty goes back to the 1970s.) They mistrust the People’s Vote campaign because it features MPs who have denounced the Labour leader – the likes of Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. They don’t want to get behind anything that includes Tories, even pro-European dissidents such as Anna Soubry.Besides, many in Corbyn’s circle, including the leader himself, if his speeches are a reliable guide, are happy leaving the EU. The question is whether they would take Brexit at any cost. Perhaps the cost itself is the lure – the thrill of a cataclysm so vast that the Tories are disqualified from governing for a generation, revealing Corbynism as the only alternative. If so, there is more than accidental complicity between Labour and the Tory no-deal Brexiters. They share utopian arousal at the thought of revolutionary opportunities available in chaos.In truth, there is no single motive behind Labour’s European policy, only a mess of conflicting impulses and overlapping factional rivalries. The leadership is relaxed about Brexit in principle the membership hates what it means in practice. Meanwhile, the probability of any government getting a deal on terms superior to EU membership is zero. As the clock ticks down, Labour’s refusal to engage with the idea of reconsidering the whole thing, to say Brexit is a bad business, looks increasingly perverse and fanatical. Corbyn might not have the courage to call it one way or another. But he might soon see the advantage in daring to ask the question."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a9cbde4b9b468d9eb5b52e5e3adf1dddc68b8a/49_185_3603_2163/master/3603.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0500c8ba6b4881fb79e5491abe8d5395","title":"brexit ruin lives british citizens europe peoples vote","story":"There’s a line in Alan Bennett’s play The History Boys where Mrs Lintott, the teacher played in the original production by Frances de la Tour, finishes an irate monologue about the essence of history by concluding: “What is history? History is women following behind with the bucket.”Hauling our citizens’ rights bucket around is unglamorous work that never gets the big headlines because it involves real people’s lives rather than seemingly intractable rows over borders and trade. The pro-Brexit press and politicians show no interest because we don’t fit their agenda, although they can’t say this overtly because we are claimed to be the reason why the rights of EU citizens in the UK are still not guaranteed. It’s telling that, along with our sister group the3million, our requests for meetings with Theresa May, the Brexit secretaries and the home secretary have gone unanswered – although Michel Barnier has met us twice.Throughout we have tried to remain neutral, patient and keep a sense of perspective. But now, faced with the prospect of either being sold out in a bad deal or the prospect of no deal at all, we can’t stay on the fence any longer.Let’s go back to the point of departure for all this. We were promised our lives would carry on exactly as normal after Brexit, first by Vote Leave then by both May and Michel Barnier. This is particularly important because, if you are going to exclude from voting the very people whose lives hang on the outcome of that vote, then you have an extra special duty of care to fight for them as hard as possible.Even if there is a deal, we cannot be said to have been a priority in the negotiations, in particular because May has not fought for our continuing right to free movement, which many of us rely on to provide for our families. Her negotiating position from the beginning has prioritised reducing the rights of EU citizens in the UK over supporting ours. So our rights will only be protected in the country where we live now – and even then, not all of them. This puts our livelihoods at risk. If you are a small-business owner like Helen, a British caterer who lives in France but makes half her income elsewhere, you won’t be able to take bookings in other EU countries at short notice, or maybe at all, because you’ll almost certainly need paperwork and, as we all know, paperwork takes time and clients don’t like to wait.In the no-deal scenario, Brits on the continent will be thrown into turmoil as they will lose their current legal status. We can only hope that an emergency deal will be made to maintain our status – or give us one that is not simply a default to being a third-country national, which is nothing like what we have now.If your view is, we’ll all lose rights, stop complaining, consider this: our personal limbo is also a political litmus test for the kind of future deals that the UK is prepared to fight for on behalf of its citizens. And if this is it, then things don’t look good for Brits in the UK itself, especially those who hoped Brexit would mean more control and a better quality of life.As children of the European project who have lived its benefits first-hand and know what future generations in the UK are set to lose – enough is enough. We have no choice but to accept that the only solution to protect our lives and livelihoods (and those of EU citizens in the UK), as well as those of all Brits in the UK, is to remain in the EU.That’s why we support a people’s vote and demand that the government deliver on its 2015 and 2017 manifesto commitments to give us back our vote and a say. If you’re going to make people reapply to live the lives they have built up through their own hard graft (on significantly worse terms than they currently have) then you owe them a vote. It’s not about sympathy or special treatment, it’s about finally having control over our own lives.• Jane Golding is chair of British in Europe, the largest coalition group of British citizens living and working in the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c91a2c9faec26ba359465a201ea3dee2c8b642a5/0_91_2602_1561/master/2602.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e00b5fe95130eb3445ecf8f505713cb","title":"grieving orca mother emotions animals mistake","story":"When we interpret animal behaviour as humanlike, we risk simply seeing ourselves – which demeans us and themAnd so, the killer whale known as J35 is back to her old self. She is no longer carrying the dead body of a calf she held aloft in the water for more than two weeks. Her so-called tour of grief has ended, to the relief of a global audience who had become wrapped up in this heart-wrenching animal drama. Great news, right? Sure. Yet I have a strange feeling in my stomach. It’s a familiar one. The pedant in me is stirring, eager to get us to consider what we know about animals and what we don’t – and may never – know about their lives. It isn’t my aim to belittle J35 and her apparent pain, far from it. It’s rather to make sure we don’t accidentally dilute the emotions of a killer whale by making it all about us.First, I have form on this issue. A while ago, I published a book called Death on Earth and episodes of apparent animal grief was one of the areas upon which I focused. During my research, I drew up a list of all sorts of anecdotes about animals labelled (by respectable researchers) as evidence of “mourning” and “grief”. These included police dogs pawing at their master’s coffins, macaques resuscitating fallen loved ones and turtles appearing on beaches to mourn at makeshift graves made by humans for the turtles that didn’t make it. I was told by members of the public on Twitter about dogs going off food after losing kennel-mates and horses burying dead stablemates in hay and I was reminded regularly of those BBC documentaries featuring elephants in apparent (but I would argue edited) tears at the loss of a loved one.So far, so nebulous. Crows added some much-needed science to the field of research into animal grief and mourning. This is because many studies of American corvids (crows, ravens, jays and related birds) have provided repeated evidence that these creatures do behave strangely around the death of their own species. Upon finding a dead corvid corpse, they group together and call wildly with one another, forming a rousing denouement of debate. “Who killed and will they kill again?” they seem to ask one another.Popular press coverage of this research liked to use the term “funeral” to describe these gatherings. This bothered me a little. Is there ritualisation similar to what you would see at a human funeral when crows and jays gather like this? Is there mass grief and sadness like that at most human funerals? No, of course not. And there’s definitely no necrophilia at human funerals either. Yet, many people think crows understand death in a way that we have no evidence they do. Why? Because of the human words we use.But killer whales are thought of differently. Like us, they are highly developed social mammals with an impressive language, dialects and even cultures. J35 must have been mourning, we think. She simply must have been. The problem is there is no way (yet) to scientifically test for sure that this is the case. Even with all the photos, there is still a distinct possibility that J35 may have just been confused. She may have even hoped her baby would revive. Pedantic (and blunt) as it sounds, if you believe J35 was displaying evidence of mourning or grief, you are making a case that rests on faith not on scientific endeavour, and that makes me uncomfortable as a scientist.This might seem unreasonable and even brutally cruel to some readers but remember this behaviour has been documented only a handful of times and that, on the whole, the sea is not filled with killer whales displaying such extreme and dramatic behaviours each time a loved one dies. Compare that to human societies, all of whom undergo dramatic periods of social upheaval upon the death of friends or family. You are likely to have experienced it. You, the reader, may still be carrying the effect of death in your human heart. That’s actual grief. That’s actual mourning.Am I being a pedant? Probably. But by loosely labelling these emotions willy-nilly in animals, I worry that we make two mistakes. The first is that we squeeze a whole range of animal behaviours into discrete categories of human emotion, thereby overlooking and failing to celebrate their unique brand of animal majesty. The second is that we dilute a real, powerful and observable human emotion by granting other animals the same emotions so freely without any scientific rigour.When we hold up a magnifying glass to nature, it’s all too easy to see ourselves reflected in the frame. Yet to truly know animals takes a more polished lens and a more measured use of words. We may never know if killer whales experience a sadness quite like our own (they may even experience a pain we cannot imagine) but a key point remains: regardless of whether they have the same emotions as us or not, they deserve our utmost kindness and our respect.

Unremarkable, you might think. Parliament is in recess, and parliamentarians are entitled to their leisure like anyone else.But this was political gardening, for before doing so she put out a quite remarkable message: “Getting ready to deploy the amazing Roundup!” it said, with a picture of the bright green bottle of a weedkiller by Monsanto – a multinational company with a toxic reputation (as even Bayer, which has recently taken it over, acknowledges). The tweet came just hours after a US jury gave a terminally ill retired groundskeeper $289m in damages for his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which it attributed to glyphosate – the active chemical in Roundup.Why would a government minister decide to explicitly endorse a controversial, questionable product? There are no comfortable answers. Is Coffey concerned about the welfare of Bayer, after the company’s share price slid following the verdict? In which case she appears to think the welfare of Bayer is an overriding concern of the UK government. Bayer controls approximately half of the global supply of proprietary seed, more than two-thirds of the chemicals used to grow food, and most GM crop genetic traits – plus huge quantities of data on what farmers are growing where. Does Coffey think she needs to act in its interests? A government minister should really be acting in the public interest – and asking why a company pushing such a questionable product has such a stranglehold on our food supplies.The writing is on the wall for glyphosate. The International Agency for Research on Cancer’s report on the chemical concluded it was probably carcinogenic to humans, and the European Union came close to a ban that was backed by a petition signed by more than 1.3 million citizens – and only stopped by intense, expensive lobbying. The European parliament has called for it to be banned by 2022.And it isn’t just the EU – other governments are reacting very differently to our own. France has said it would ban the chemical within three years. Germany has begun instituting a ban and some retailers there have pulled it from their stores. Italy has banned its use as a pre-harvest treatment.The path of Roundup is one we have seen taken by many other poisons introduced into the food we eat, the air we breathe and the soil we depend on for life. They are introduced as a wonder. But soon a few campaigners, and ill people, start to wonder about their real effects. Public concern grows and eventually they are banned. But what is unique about glyphosate is its ubiquity, and extremely high levels of use – associated with the GM “Roundup ready” crops bred just for it – and the levels many are consuming, which are almost impossible to avoid, as Green MEPs found in tests in 2016.The world is waking up to this danger, and the fact that we cannot continue with the industrial-scale monoculture form of agriculture with which it is associated. On one side are the people, the environmentalists and an increasing number of governments around the world. On the other side we have the giant multinational Bayer and the UK government.Weeding out the poisons from Europe’s food and farming sector will benefit public health and the environment – and it is eminently achievable. But farmers need support in adapting to viable and affordable alternatives to chemicals, like the methods being showcased by farmers in the rapidly expanding organic sector. And with Defra ministers apparently keen to keep pushing the poison, it is questionable whether this support for farmers will be part of a post-Brexit vision for agriculture.In 2016 the EU referendum saw many Britons saying they wanted to “take back control”. They were absolutely right to want that – we need to take back control of Westminster from the interests of a few multinational companies, and get it operating in our interests. We need to make it a democracy that works for us – not big business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/687d93c37f9ca111b066e6a964023cd8539d09da/0_164_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95890559082d2417fea24dfb2b0fa5db","title":"free rail tickets pegged rents give teachers money","story":"The government needs new ways to attract more teachers if it’s not willing to fund a competitive salaryTeachers are the envy of the country during the summer break, snoozing and reading for six weeks. But spare them a thought: when they finished term last month they had no idea what salary they would return to in September. The cowardly government waited for schools to break up before announcing it would ignore the independent review body on teacher pay and not provide the recommended pay increase after all.This shows remarkable chutzpah. Almost 30 years ago, when the government wrestled teacher pay negotiations away from the unions, it did so on the basis that an independent board would carefully consider the evidence each year before decreeing a fair pay rise. It was always possible for the education secretary to ignore what someone smarter, who had spent more time looking at the evidence, had recommended. But why would you, and why now, given there is a serious teacher shortage?This year, a third of new teachers left the classroom within five years – the highest level since records began. Thousands flocked to work in international schools. Teacher training places are going spare for the sixth year in a row.Senior teachers howled at the injustice, but it’s quite possible differential increases will continue in future. Hinds has presumably noted that older teachers, who are more likely to have no mortgage and more generous pensions, might be tempted into earlier retirement or part-time work if given higher salaries, which would exacerbate the teacher shortage. On the other hand, the salaries of new teacher are falling behind. Prison guards and police officers now start on more.Meanwhile, rocketing house prices are no longer confined to the capital, meaning regional pay increases may be needed. A recent survey of more than 2,000 teachers found mortgage and rent costs in the south-east, south-west and East Anglia are closing in on London. Yet teacher salaries are the same in Oxford, where the average house price is £523,000, as in Oldham, where it is a quarter of the price.Transport costs are also rising, with a third of teachers reporting a monthly spend of more than £200. Londoners had the lowest costs, as they get heavily subsidised travel. In that light, it’s hard to justify teachers in the capital continuing to get more cash when rises in fuel tax and car insurance are hitting rural staff much harder.Wages aren’t the only solution to living costs, though. If the government could pull its head out of its Brexit-shaped hole, it might remember it is also in charge of things such as housing and transport. And it could use them.For example, London is building 16,000 homes with rents pegged to income. Bully for London (again) but why not extend this to key workers across the country? Or, the next time the transport secretary runs a train franchise, why not require companies to give free passes to teachers? If the government thinks it can pull off mammoth Brexit trade deals, then making provincial train companies carry a few teachers for free should be easy.Ultimately, if the Conservatives really don’t have the imagination to find more money for wages, then more imagination is needed to reduce living costs. Otherwise, the teacher supply cupboard is going to be bare, and even the keenest holiday worshipper won’t be tempted to join the profession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b52098d83d160875263d3d7170ce9dc1795c1b/0_199_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05407a9b7d5d75bba25ba1ea7901d4b6","title":"harlem transforms lives west london barack obama","story":"A scheme lauded by Barack Obama is steering pupils out of hardship and into universityTwo years ago Phoenix academy in Shepherds Bush, west London, was put in special measures. Its headteacher, Oli Knight, knows that turning around academic performance and behaviour in a school where many students come from challenging backgrounds isn’t easy. But he’s hoping an ambitious project inspired by an American success story can make the difference.Phoenix is one of 15 secondary, primary and nursery schools being supported by a programme of interventions run by a relatively new charity, the West London Zone (WLZ). The aim is to steer children in one of the most deprived areas in the country away from a life of hardship and into university. Its CEO, Louisa Mitchell, says it’s about “driving change for an entire generation”.WLZ is the idea of Danny Kruger who in 2011, as head of the criminal justice charity Only Connect, visited the Harlem Children’s Zone charity in New York. HCZ co-ordinates intensive interventions from various agencies to equip the poorest children for university. Support starts early – parents of under-threes attend Baby College for lessons on child development – and continues until the child is 18.Driven by a conviction that the formula could work in the UK, Kruger founded WLZ which, after a successful pilot in 2015 in London’s White City, launched its first full two-year programme. This has recently just come to an end and the second cohort is about to enter its second year.This year the charity reached 505 students, and the aim is to have a positive impact on the lives of 13,000 children over 10 years.So how does it work? Each participating school has a WLZ link worker on site (Phoenix has two), who matches selected children with services provided by 24 partner organisations, including one-to-one tutoring, confidence building, counselling and sporting activities.Some take place in school, and others on the partner sites. The balance of activities is important, says Mitchell: “There’s no point putting a child into extra maths and English if mentally or emotionally they’re not ready to engage.” The aim, she says, is to identify needs and provide an “ecosystem” of support so they “get the right thing at the right time”.Having link workers who can relate to the children is crucial. Farial Missi, a psychology graduate, is one of the Phoenix link workers and a former Phoenix head girl. She says a lot of the children she supports come from broken families or have parents who are recent immigrants. Many “don’t have a trusted adult in their life”. “The most important thing is a child having someone who can listen to them without judgment, to guide and support them through whatever they’re going through.”Children are selected based on anonymised data provided by schools. Instead of selecting those in crisis (most of whom are already receiving professional support), the project chooses young people whose home and school difficulties put them at risk of poor outcomes. The link workers report back regularly to parents and the school’s senior leadership team.When I visit Phoenix on a hot summer day, Missi and her fellow link worker, Sasha Jones, introduce me to some of the students. Hajar A and Hajar C are both 15-year-old girls who have been receiving one-to-one tuition at the Clement James Centre, a local educational charity, and leapt from set four to the\u0026nbsptop set in their core subjects. Both were shy but gave presentations in school assembly after attending Fearless Futures, an equality and leadership programme for girls. “I didn’t want to embarrass myself or say something stupid,” Hajar C admits.When Missi started working with the girls they weren’t able to answer a question about their life goals. Now Hajar C goes for one-to-one tuition, even in holidays, and says she would like to become a lawyer. Hajar A, meanwhile, is considering a career in computer science – but also considers herself “more sporty” after sessions with the London Sports Trust. Another year 10 student, Jamal, has been through a period of poor attendance, but is back on track and, thanks to one of the WLZ interventions, and has developed a passion for kickboxing.For a school such as Phoenix, the extra support is invaluable. Knight has seen a difference in behaviour and performance in the children on the programme. “A big barrier for us is the issues that the children bring to school that stop them making the progress they should make, or engage with or trust the school. WLZ has worked at a level it’s impossible for teachers to work at.”For the hardworking link workers, the reward comes in seeing the difference they’ve made to children’s lives. Missi tells me about a student who was playing truant and on the verge of dealing drugs. Talking to him and encouraging him to reflect “helped him to have a different perspective and see things differently and not get into the wrong crowd”, she says.

Mountain hares have been implicated in the spread of the disease and so their culling intensified in the 1990s, even though scientific studies have found no compelling evidence that it helps control the virus. Earlier this year it was revealed that up to 38,000 mountain hares are killed on Scottish estates each year. Dr Adam Watson, an ecologist for the Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology who has been studying mountain hares for 75 years, said: “Having counted mountain hares across the moors and high tops of the eastern Highlands since 1943, I find the decline in numbers of these beautiful animals both compelling and of great concern. We need the Scottish government and Scottish Natural Heritage to take action to help these iconic mammals of the hill – I hope they will listen to the voice of scientific research.”The paper published in the Journal of Applied Ecology found that long-term declines associated with conifer planting were least severe in areas where there was heather burning as part of grouse moor management. Burning the heather removes the old woody plants, and allows young, tasty shoots to grow, providing improved nutrition for both grouse and hares.But the study found that changed after 1999, with the most marked mountain hare declines on grouse moorland. On higher, alpine sites, numbers fluctuated but increased overall until 2007 and then declined, although not to the unprecedented lows seen on moorland sites.Gamekeepers and estate managers claim the unregulated mountain hare culls limit the spread of ticks, protect trees and safeguard fragile environments, and a policy of voluntary restraint is in place.David Noble, chairman of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust in Scotland, said data gathered by the GWCT over the same period as the study does not suggest such a decline in hare numbers on grouse moors.“Our counts in recent years have found robust hare populations close to where this paper appears to be reporting very few,” he said. “Now this paper is published we look forward to reviewing it, especially how the counts were made, because assessing hare numbers accurately is challenging.”The Scottish government is to review grouse moor management next year and Noble called for a coordinated count of mountain hares to better safeguard local populations. He added: “It is also important the grouse moor community take on the challenge of assessing hare numbers themselves and does not ignore public concerns about the culling of this charismatic species.”The RSPB said urgent action is needed to protect mountain hares. Duncan Orr Ewing, head of species and land management at the charity in Scotland, said: “We consider that large-scale population reduction culls are both illegal under EU law and unwarranted as a method for controlling grouse disease.“Management of this species should now be more tightly controlled by Scottish Natural Heritage to safeguard mountain hare populations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e5377a8f2d9cb094d39c8c3a8ea9f2c85cc8916/0_0_2901_1741/master/2901.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e108718b6f8b705d6454d0e734a89cdb","title":"i watched nicolas cage movies for 14 hours straight and im sold","story":"Luke Buckmaster entered an overnight marathon a fan of the actor. Seven films later, he emerged with reverenceWhat kind of masochists would attend an all-night Nicolas Cage movie marathon? What kind of sadists would program seven of his films in a row? If one wants to observe the famously extravagant American actor for 14 hours straight, why not do it from the comfort of your own home?I ponder these questions en route to the Melbourne international film festival’s overnight Cage-a-Thon, and think about how I might answer them myself. I have always been a fan of Cage’s work, perhaps even a big one, but did I really understand the reverie he elicits from his fans? I did not. Any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant, but what is it about the 54-year-old performer that deserves seven movies, played back-to-back? Five years ago, in a Reddit AMA, Ethan Hawke described Cage as “the only actor since Marlon Brando that’s actually done anything new with the art”, by taking audiences “away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours.”The description stuck with me. Cage, who was raised in a well-cultured family (his father was a professor of literature, his mother a dancer, and his uncle is the great director Francis Ford Coppola) is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor. What else will I glean from an all-night marathon?I imagine the audience at the Cage-a-Thon will be a small group of weirdos who all look like Max Schreck from Nosferatu, or extras from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I am instead surprised to discover a crowd of around 700 normal-looking people gathered at Melbourne’s famous Astor theatre. When the words “Nicolas Cage” appear during the opening credits of the first feature to be screened, the phantasmagoric revenge thriller Mandy, the crowd goes ballistic.Fast-forward 13 hours. I’ve consumed lots of coffee, a little whiskey and a can of Red Bull the size of a car battery. The audience – thinned to around 100 diehards determined to stay to the end – are exhausted but jubilant. The whooping and cheering that began in Mandy has continued all the way to the grand finale: the 1997 action blockbuster Con Air.When Cage delivers a memorable line of dialogue (such as “I said put the bunny back in the box”), we cheer. When he winks or runs or jumps or fly kicks, we cheer. When he grabs a ladder attached to a fire engine and holds on for dear life, by God do we cheer.The first time the crowd truly loses it – erupting into the kind of hullabaloo I imagine the Romans made for gladiators – arrives about halfway through Mandy. Covered in blood and dressed in briefs and a shirt, Cage gulps vodka straight from the bottle and pours it over a gaping wound. He then sits on a toilet seat and pants as if possessed, inhaling and exhaling like some kind of horrible mythical creature. The crowd cannot get enough of it.The third feature film is the Coen brothers’ zany 1987 comedy Raising Arizona and the fourth, the director John Dahl’s 1993 neo-noir Red Rock West. This film begins with a topless Cage doing exercises on a wide open road – eliciting hearty applause and the first (but not the last) sustained round of wolf whistles. But it is during the fourth feature – the 1989 black comedy Vampire’s Kiss – that all hell breaks loose.Vampire’s Kiss is the movie you recommend if Cage’s greatness is ever called into question. His performance as a maniacal literary agent perfectly encapsulates why David Lynch described him as “the jazz musician of American acting”. Or, less charitably, why Sean Penn once famously called Cage “no longer an actor” and “more like a performer”.You could deride Cage for over-acting, as many have, or you could say his performance in Vampire’s Kiss is so exquisitely eccentric – so wild and restless and imaginative – it virtually defies description. I’ll have a crack anyway: it’s German expressionism meets Monty Python absurdism meets contemporary dance. The legendary alphabet scene generates a response so loud and enthusiastic I can feel my seat shaking.By the time the fifth film begins – the director Neil LaBute’s critically maligned 2006 remake of The Wicker Man – it’s around 5am. With utter horror I realise there are around five hours left. Advertised as a 12-hour event, the schedule – which includes short breaks and a dozen or so trailers for Cage’s lesser-known works – has blown out to 14.The grindhouse-style B movie Drive Angry is the second-last on the bill. It contains a scene featuring Cage having sex with a woman in a cruddy motel while simultaneously shooting an influx of bad guys entering their room. He is thrusting and penetrating and spinning around their conjoined bodies while taking down his oppressors one by one. This fascinating and ghastly display – a gun-slinging moment from a western, crossed with a tantric sex routine – wakes me up more than the coffee.The audience is smaller but louder than ever during Con Air. When we whoop as Cage swings from the ladder attached to the fire engine, it occurs to me that we are not applauding inidual moments but an entire career.I arrived at the Cage-a-Thon a fan of Cage’s work. I left it with a new-found respect, and now consider him one of my favourite actors. Is there another actor anywhere in the world as original and distinctive?In Cage’s hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons. Everything – from inidual scenes down to single lines of dialogue – feel like they have been embraced as opportunities for creation. Cage is usually interesting even when his films are not. He is erratic and unpredictable he is captivating and he is capricious. He is a performer. He is a troubadour. He is a jazz musician.When I leave the Cage-a-Thon, dimly remembering a time when I watched movies that didn’t star Nicolas Cage, I resolve to never ever attend another movie marathon. Two days later I make a slight adjustment. If it’s another one with Nic Cage movies, I’ll think about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93703a2da7c6487453f41de9ac62d398db4a2b6f/87_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3917383c35daf9ae7cbabd311ce9d74","title":"the cove a whale of a tale documentary taiji","story":"In new documentary A Whale of a Tale, film-maker Megumi Sasaki revisits the Japanese town of Taiji and examines the damage left behindThe 2009 documentary The Cove, which depicted the practice of corralling and slaughtering dolphins in a small bay tinged crimson from the blood, has visited a bewildering past decade upon the small Japanese town of Taiji.An outburst of international outrage at Taiji’s 400-year-old practice of dolphin hunting saw activists descend upon the coastal town to demand change, as well as lacerating criticism from celebrities and politicians including the then US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, who called the activity “inhumane”.A year after its release, The Cove won an Academy award for best documentary, with producer Fisher Stevens grasping the Oscar statue as he explained how the work was an “entertaining film that also tries to enlighten everybody”.This was the moment that New York-based Japanese film-maker Megumi Sasaki felt provoked to craft a response. “There’s a saying in Japan about a little fishbone stuck in your throat,” she tells the . “It’s an issue that bothers you but you can’t reach it. This was my fish bone and I needed to speak up. I decided to make a film as soon as The Cove won the Academy award.”Sasaki’s film, A Whale of a Tale, s six years in and around Taiji as fishermen and activists face off, at times unpleasantly. “It’s wrong for outsiders to come in and try to destroy our history and culture,” says a whaler at one point, as protesters from the Sea Shepherd group film his comrades and hurl criticism at them. One of the activists calls a whaler a “dumbass shit”.Dolphin hunting takes place elsewhere in Japan but Taiji is the only place where “drive” hunting occurs. This involves forcing dolphins into the now infamous cove, where they are then penned in by long nets. The dolphins are then either sold on to aquariums to become performing exhibits or butchered for meat.In the US and most of Europe, it’s become axiomatic that the killing of dolphins and whales is barbaric and unnecessary. Dolphin shows are also coming under more scrutiny. Ric O’Barry, who brandished a pro-dolphin flag on stage at the 2010 Oscars, used to train dolphins for the popular US TV series Flipper until one, Kathy, died.O’Barry is convinced that Kathy intentionally closed her own blowhole and committed suicide because of her distress. He has spent the following 40 years campaigning against dolphins in captivity and, latterly, the Taiji hunts. “I created this dolphin amusement industry,” O’Barry says in A Whale of a Tale. “I used to be motivated by guilt, now I’m motivated by progress.”Sasaki, whose previous documentaries include 2008’s Herb \u0026amp Dorothy, uses A Whale of a Tale to question whether progress would be better served in bridging a yawning cultural ide rather than simply shutting down the Taiji hunt.Residents of the town are shown ladling whale meatballs into cups and enjoying chunks of striped dolphin. At other points, they burn incense in ceremonies that deify whales, the likeness of which adorn almost every large wall in Taiji. The whalers mill glumly around the dock as they are harangued. Sasaki is pointing to a long cultural practice that has collided with an enraged west that has purged itself of whaling.“The Cove was a well-told story but it was so one-sided and was full of prejudice,” she says. “It was like they were pointing a camera at people who can’t raise their own voice. It’s like bullying.”A Whale of a Tale illustrates how a sophisticated campaign by groups such as Sea Shepherd has, perhaps unsurprisingly, barely been countered in the court of public opinion by a town of barely 4,000 people. But it does also acknowledge how nationalist figures in Japan have seized upon the issue.Consumption of whale and dolphin meat has been declining steadily in Japan, to the point where many young people in Tokyo have never eaten it. Sasaki has spent the last 40 years in New York but grew up in Sapporo, where she remembers only eating whale meat for the occasional school lunch.“The older generations who grew up after the war, when there was a food shortage, have a sense of nostalgia towards it, but it was never my favourite food,” she says. “I didn’t even have dolphin until I met the leader of the whalers in 2014 and went to his house. He gave me dolphin sashimi, I suppose it was a test. It was delicious, it tasted like beef carpaccio with a fishy taste.”Even as consumption of whale and dolphin meat has dropped, it has been embraced as an intrinsic part of Japanese character by rightwing activists, some of whom are shown in A Whale of a Tale, telling Sea Shepherd to go home via loudspeakers mounted on cars.The dolphins slaughtered in Taiji aren’t considered at risk of becoming extinct, so the hunting throws up broader questions. Do we have the moral right to kill animals in this way? What about pigs and cows dispatched in miserable conditions in the west? Who has the right to tell who what to kill or eat? The overseas opprobrium has, ironically, breathed life into a dying practice.“As long as we have pressure from outside the country, the more determined Japanese people are to continue it,” Sasaki says. “It’s such an irony. If these activists just stopped pressuring Japan, the younger generation would not care about eating this and it would basically all go away.”Sasaki said that the hunt points to broader ides between countries such as the US and Japan. “Many Christian western countries think in terms of a hierarchy, where humans are near the top, just below God, and then nature is beneath us,” she says.“In Japan, people think humans are only part of nature and no animal is better or worse. It’s very puzzling for them when westerners say dolphins and whales are intelligent and human-like, because all creatures are special. What makes an intelligent animal, anyway? Birds can fly halfway around the world without GPS, isn’t that intelligence? We hand-pick the animals we like, like dolphins or elephants that we think are majestic, but we don’t pay attention to others that are endangered.”This cultural misalignment is exacerbated by a certain stubbornness in Japan, Sasaki says. “Tradition in Japan is something that is just handed down, whether it’s good or bad, whether it fits today’s world or not. In the west, there’s more of an examination of these sort of traditional activities.”Ultimately, Sasaki hopes she has presented something more even-handed than The Cove, where the dolphin hunters were largely seen in footage shot from undercover cameras disguised as rocks. She doubts it will change many minds, however.“This town of Taiji has been totally bullied by the international community but I made it clear to the fishermen that I’m not going to take sides,” she says. “I’m not here to change minds, I’m not an activist, I’m a storyteller. I want people to think about new perspectives because the world is complicated, it’s not black and white.“There are universal themes about how we coexist. Things are so ided in the world, we don’t listen to each other, we demonize the other side of the argument. This is just a microcosm of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b2a4d62728a97303be619e5d879bdebb7c804a/43_0_1281_769/master/1281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00fcbd6c18b08b541978d5370551b878","title":"the festival review joe thomas iain morris inbetweeners","story":"The Inbetweeners’ Joe Thomas crowdsurfs a weekend of misadventures and self-abasing nudity in Iain Morris’s likable comedyDirector Iain Morris first enlivened this quiet-to-dead corner of the cinematic silly season with the astonishingly successful Inbetweeners diptych. Having packed those boys off with a happy ending (stop sniggering), he now attempts something only slightly different: bussing Joe Thomas – perhaps the most immediately available ’Tweener – and a grab bag of emergent talent to the Leeds music festival to recreate this muddily parochial rite-of-passage for an audience too young, too late or too worldly-wise to snap up day passes for this year’s festivities. Chasing the youth pound this flagrantly is always a risk, as those who suffered The Bad Education Movie can attest, yet The Festival’s pursuit remains broadly likable, and Morris again backs it up with real comedy nous.This film-maker is now so confident that he can toss off a genre-regulation misdirected-ejaculate gag within the first two minutes – what we might call a coarse record. Nudging Thomas’s twerpish Nick towards self-knowledge after a graduation humiliation is the main event, but The Festival gets there by deploying disparate, sometimes random, mostly winning ideas (jolly druids!). Morris has a knack of pushing a joke just far enough that the stretching itself becomes funny. Disproportionately devoted dad Jemaine Clement performs an agonising three-point turn to the strains of Crowded House Theo Barklem-Biggs’ arch-caner Gordy does one big ketamine hit, then spends the rest of the film yammering in holes.If The Festival’s framing still resembles an extended E4 special – drizzly medium shots predominate, distinguishing the British festival experience from ultra-glam Coachella – the consolation is that it fills the screen with people you’d happily share a yurt with. Thomas, who spent the entire Inbetweeners project quietly mastering the playing of sexual frustration, deserves the Robin Askwith prize for self-abasing nudity. He builds a nice, easy double act with baffled wingman Hammed Animashaun, particularly when replaying Magic Mike with wellies and Claudia O’Doherty, whose spacey-perky rhythms elevated Judd Apatow’s Netflix series Love, is a genuine ray of sunshine as a fellow traveller the pair encounter en route. Very soon, O’Doherty will be the headline act in comedies like these, but this good-natured crowdpleaser generously lets her steal whole stretches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a7edb95a00fdaa22b8586da9ff5c4ed626c31e7/315_312_5186_3112/master/5186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e119be162462a3188679e23ef5966a0","title":"share your potato recipes with us","story":"The potato may be falling out of favour but we can’t believe it’s all over.

José Mourinho missed out on his desired centre-back. A message emerged that the club would not back the manager in the market on a carte blanche basis. He made Paul Pogba captain yet after a fine display against Leicester the midfielder said there would be a fine for saying certain things – again illuminating a difficult relationship with his manager.Yet with the 2-1 win on Friday Mourinho has negotiated half of the Leicester-Brighton double he identified as difficult owing to the many key players not available because of post-World Cup breaks. It offers a glimmer of optimism following Mourinho’s pre-season gloom. And given the hierarchy’s view that, while it will be tough, United should be title contenders, what has to be done to turn this hope to reality?Virtually everywhere Mourinho looks there are tensions he could do with easing. Chief here is the mutual disaffection between him and Pogba with the post-Leicester outburst possibly rooted in Mourinho’s lukewarm praise of his triumphant World Cup campaign. The Mourinho-Pogba contretemps are mirrored by those the former is enduring with Anthony Martial. The player wants to leave but, given the manager also missed out on a wide-forward in the window, pragmatism may mean differences should be buried. And while Mourinho and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, are cordial, the disconnect over transfers illustrates all is not perfect between the club’s two most important men. An upturn in these relationships is required.Given the scattergun recruitment since the supremely successful manager-chief executive axis of Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill ended six years ago, the decision to create an extra layer of football expertise is timely. Although Mourinho (or any incumbent) may wonder if authority over transfers will wane, a correct appointment should actually prove a boost. If both manager and director of football (DOF) are on the same page regarding identification of targets, then the case to be presented jointly to Woodward for him to sign off the finance should be bolstered. The plan is for the DOF to be in place once the restructuring of staff and expansion of the AON Training Complex for the women’s team is complete. It could, then, occur in time for the winter window and be of benefit if United remain in the championship race and Mourinho wishes to strengthen for a second-half-of-the-season push.United managed two victories from the five matches away from Old Trafford against the other top six sides. They drew 0-0 at Liverpool and lost 1-0 at Chelsea and 2-0 at Tottenham Hotspur but they beat Arsenal 3-1 and City 3-2. A yield of seven from 15 points while scoring only five times is not title-winning form though beating Pep Guardiola’s runaway victors proves the on-road record can be improved. United also suffered two surprise reverses on their travels, going down at Huddersfield Town (2-1) and Newcastle United (1-0) before the deflating reverse to West Brom at Old Trafford (1-0) that handed City the crown as early as 15 April.A prevailing reason for the executive’s belief that United can challenge is the impressive defensive record under Mourinho and the high margin for improvement in goals for. In 2016-17 United registered 54 goals but conceded only 29. Last year the count was 68 and 28. Compare this with the 85 of the champions, Chelsea, two seasons ago and the 106 of their successors, City, with United’s goals conceded second best each year. The hierarchy’s view is Mourinho should be able to coax more from a six-strong group who number Romelu Lukaku, Martial, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Alexis Sánchez and Juan Mata. Lukaku well last year yet his 16 Premier League finishes were half as many as the Golden Boot winner, Mo Salah, and City had two men with more goals – Sergio Agüero (21) and Raheem Sterling (18). The Belgian needs support – no team-mate managed double figures – so the onus is on the other five each to register 10 or more times in the league. The onus, too, is on Mourinho to ensure they can achieve this. See final point …This has become the hoariest of chestnuts because it is so fundamental to United’s chances of challenging under Mourinho. Put simply he has to enable his creative players to express themselves, take more chances and swarm forward in more cut-throat style. There is difficulty recalling more than a handful of times this has happened under the manager and what is most baffling is how much better his team are when it does. The 3-2 derby win over City is a prime illustration of the frustrations many fans feel with Mourinho. United were 2-0 down at the interval and staring at allowing Guardiola’s side to become champions by beating them at the Etihad Stadium. Given zero choice, out came Mourinho’s men for the second half, Pogba scored twice quickly – on 53 and 55 minutes – before Chris Smalling’s late finish completed a memorable comeback win. This spirit of twist-or-bust has to be the template this year or United will not be contenders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/951e126b125e14557642e145699fcf79bdef869e/28_195_2743_1647/master/2743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8654052d38fa38b386b6c072fcb6abf9","title":"football transfer rumours cristian eriksen to psg for 100m","story":"Today’s fluff wants all you gappers and finger snappers Having failed to recruit a single player before the time available for incoming deals ran out, Tottenham’s summer transfer window is only now starting to hot up, with this morning’s newspapers linking them with a stadium-fund-swelling if slightly optimistic £150m-worth of outgoings. The Express exclusively report that Paris St-Germain are ready to spend £100m on Christian Eriksen, on whom the French side “have long been keen”, but that Spurs are “equally determined not to sell”. The Parisians aren’t the only club whose eye has been caught by the twinkle-toed Dane: according to the Star, Real Madrid could join the chase if they sell Luka Modric to Internazionale (though according to Tuttosport that move is becoming less likely).Spurs are considerably less determined to hold on to Danny Rose, with the Mirror reporting that they would be happy to wave him farewell – though if they receive the £50m they apparently want for their 28-year-old reserve left-back, astonishment would be a more appropriate emotion. PSG – them again – “have joined Schalke in the chase”, apparently. And Rose might not be the only Englishman heading for Gelsenkirchen, with Schalke also attempting to bring in Chelsea’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek on loan. It sounds like they shouldn’t get their hopes up: “Loftus-Cheek is minded to stay and fight for his place,” says the Mail, while the  insist that “the prospect of the 22-year-old being allowed to leave is described as ‘extremely unlikely’”.Barcelona haven’t given up hope of buying Paul Pogba this month, or at least they haven’t explicitly ruled out the possibility. The Sun quotes the club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, saying: “There’s still time to do business, but I will not speak of any names. We have respect for all clubs.” United obviously want the midfielder to stay, but less obviously also hope Matteo Darmian will reject the advances of Juventus, Napoli and Inter to remain at Old Trafford. This is news to the Manchester Evening News, who believe that “Darmian wants to leave” and that “United are prepared to let him depart provided they receive an acceptable offer”.Middlesbrough and Aston Villa are engaged in a two-way scrap for the loan signing of Everton’s Yannick Bolasie, though it says here that “Boro believe they can offer a more attractive package”. The Star says Tony Pulis “wants several loan signings” this month and it is an ambition Villa – who also have Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham and West Ham’s Robert Snodgrass on their loan list – appear to share.Marseille might make a bid for Mohamed Elneny, the Egyptian midfielder who has slipped down the pecking order at Arsenal since the arrival of some better midfielders. And Liverpool are ready to sell their slow-motion Estonian Ragnar Klavan, with a variety of Bundesliga clubs apparently mulling over a bid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d862eda614e399fdf8484efcdd6f0d2c170211/0_233_3558_2134/master/3558.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c006560f2eb5614d220197554a2fd92e","title":"international champions cup attendances","story":"The International Champions Cup is still capable of attracting huge crowds in the US, but away from the marquee games, attendances were downWhatever you do, don’t call it pre-season. Meaningless games are now a thing of the past, at least according to the International Champions Cup. Billed as “club football’s premier summer tournament,” this year’s edition was the largest to date, encompassing 18 teams and 27 games played in 22 different cities on three different continents. And yet, the crowd numbers didn’t quite live up to hype.On more than one occasion, swathes of empty seats were visible for games involving some of the world’s biggest clubs. Only 16,000 fans turned up at the 69,000-capacity Heinz Field for a match between Borussia Dortmund and Benfica. A game between Roma and Tottenham in San Diego attracted just 18,800 spectators from a potential capacity of 70,000. The German and English champions, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, sold under 30,000 tickets for their game in Miami.It should be noted that Charlie Stillitano, the larger than life personality at the top of the ICC, says that ticket sales are in fact up this year: “There were 492,000 sold in 2013, 642,000 in 2014, 985,000 for 2015, 964,000 in 2016 and 903,000 for 2017,” he said. “And we think this year we’re on track for 1.1m.” But this is largely down to the fact eight more games were played this summer. Per match, attendances are significantly down.It could be argued that this is a knock-on effect from the World Cup: with many superstars still on holiday tickets were naturally harder to shift, and there was a general football fatigue after a month of matches nearly every day. However, that explanation doesn’t wash when you consider Atlanta United set a new MLS attendance record on the day of the World Cup final. Rather than being jaded by what they were watching from Russia, American fans were energised by the World Cup. But for many MLS was as attractive an option as the ICC to feed their habit.This feels like a trend rooted in satisfaction, or a lack thereof: it’s likely that American fans have grown tired of being taken advantage of. The cheapest available general sale ticket for the aforementioned game between Bayern Munich and Man City in Miami was $78, once admin fees were factored in. This was not an outlier. Ticket prices have been this high across the board for years. In contrast, tickets for an Atlanta game can be bought for as little as $38 on resale sites. And while fans may not be able to see the likes of Lionel Messi and Paul Pogba in MLS, they will get a decent quality, meaningful game played in front of passionate fans at somewhere like Atlanta. This summer may have marked something of a watershed in the development of the ICC. Where does the competition go from here? Can it ever be anything more than a glorified series of pre-season fixtures? How does it garner credibility and prestige? It’s possible that appearance fees could be tailored depending on achievement, awarding a higher fee for those who do well in the competition. But would that be enough for teams to take the ICC seriously, for it to finally be considered a real tournament and not just a money-spinning, pre-season jolly? European clubs are most likely happy with the tournament the way it is. Managers certainly wouldn’t welcome the pressure of yet another top-level competition. Pre-season affords them some rare time with their players away from the glare of the regular season, when a firing can be just a few bad results away. Pre-season is a time for the introduction of new signings, the testing of formations and the blooding of youngsters. The games still have a purpose, even if the games aren’t high stake.The ICC has been used as a trojan horse by many European clubs who believe it could be a test-case for an invitation-only competition that could one day take the place of the Champions League. Indeed, Stillitano has previously held talks with clubs such as Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs concerning a potential shake-up to the whole structure of the European game. Therein could lie the lasting legacy of the ICC. It’s difficult to envisage the competition ever being more than it currently is, but the precedent set could ultimately change European football. This message wouldn’t exactly work well on a billboard, though, and so the ICC’s problems are more immediate. American fans’ appetite for football is as strong as ever but, at least from the ICC’s perspective, they are becoming harder to sell to.

With the side unbeaten in all competitions and two points ahead of Chelsea, their nearest rivals, the prospect of finishing the season empty-handed seemed almost laughable. Yet as the curtain fell, the humbled club were without silverware.Between January and May the 2016 WSL1 champions lost to Arsenal in the Continental Cup final, were knocked out of the FA Cup semi-finals by Chelsea, suffered a narrow defeat by Lyon in the Champions League and were beaten four times in the league.Now their manager, Nick Cushing, is preparing to enter the restructured fully professional top tier and says the task has only got harder.“We know that we have no ine right to win,” he says before Manchester City’s season opener against Birmingham in the Continental Cup on Sunday. “When we won in 2016 we didn’t think we would now become the dominant team. We knew we’d need to work to continue to be successful.“We’re realistic. Every year every team is getting better and better. Chelsea are probably setting the standard and everyone else is pushing hard to follow.”While Cushing is keen to stress that last season had its pluses he also says there are many lessons to be learned from the way the team slipped away. “We were really pleased with the first three-quarters of the season, not to say we weren’t pleased with the end. There were many positives from our season last year.“But we have to be realistic. We’ve been a team for five years now and every year we’ve learnt a lot about ourselves. Last year we learnt an incredible amount about where we are as a team, what we do really well and where we need to improve.”The depth of Cushing’s squad was questioned as the team fell behind. Chelsea’s manager, Emma Hayes, was able to rotate and tinker with a squad packed with experience to deal with the demanding new schedule of a winter season. However, a spate of injuries – both short- and long-term – left Cushing’s young squad increasingly exposed.The manager points to the seasonal switch as part of the problem but equally does not shy away from the fact that the depth of the squad needed consideration at the season’s close. “Listen, people will always question the teams that don’t win because ultimately the standard is set by the teams that win, I get that,” he says.“Maybe we learnt a little bit about the season last year, changing to a winter season meant we played Champions League football within our season which meant that we played an extra eight to 10 games than we did the year before. So yes, squad depth is definitely something we’ve reflected on and acted on.”This summer he has recruited to bolster the areas shown to be weakest in the previous campaign. He has brought in the outstanding 17-year-old Lauren Hemp from Bristol City – who has four goals in three games at the ongoing Under-20 World Cup – alongside more experienced players such as the Liverpool captain, Gemma Bonner, the forward Caroline Weir, Wolfsburg’s Tessa Wullaert and the Canadian forward Janine Beckie from Sky Blue FC.“We’ve acted on different areas where we feel we may have lost physical fitness and freshness,” reflects Cushing. “Because not only did we play 40-plus games last year. Our players also played every international fixture.“I’ve said from 2014, we’ll always support our players internationally because that’s what we do here. Some could say to the detriment of our season last year with the Continental Cup final and the FA Cup semi-final falling right off the back of international windows and us having 17-18 players away. Maybe our preparation was affected and we’ve reflected on that as well.”The Blues have born the brunt of their players’ success internationally. Last year they lost the right-back Lucy Bronze to the five-times Champions League winners Lyon and Toni Duggan to Barcelona. This summer Izzy Christiansen, one of their best players last season, has teamed up with Bronze in France, while the Danish forward Nadia Nadim announced in July that she had submitted a transfer request. Cushing says there is no update, though the player’s agent has told the Danish newspaper BT that she will be staying in Manchester.“The evolution of football teams means that players will come and go. We’re really pleased with who’s come in. People can see players wanting to leave and further their careers but we’ve just signed a player from Wolfsburg, a European powerhouse, and she’s decided to come to Man City.“Players will come and go, the art of it is trying to make sure that when you’re recruiting players you’re recruiting the right players for the team and the right players for the style of football we want to be playing.”The way City play is important to Cushing, because for him, and the club, the project is about more than silverware: “I think people have seen that we’ve tried to evolve it over the years. We want to make sure we entertain our fans.“We want to be successful but we have a greater goal of trying to develop Manchester City Women, to develop the women’s game and to fill our stadium with fans that enjoy coming and watching us.”• After last weekend’s thrilling 3-1 win against the current Under-20 World Cup champions, North Korea, the young Lionesses went on to top Group B and secure a place in the quarter-finals. A Georgia Stanway penalty put England in the driving seat against Brazil but an injury time goal from Ariadina left them needing a win against Mexico to clinch the top spot. Jacqueline Ovalle put the Mexicans ahead in the 37th minute but a blistering second half saw England score six goals in half an hour, with Hemp completing a hat-trick in the 80th minute. England will play the Netherlands in the last eight.• Goals from Lindsey Horan – her 11th of the season – and Hayley Raso secured a 2-0 win for Portland Thorns against Orlando Pride and lifted them above their opponents, into third, as the race for the top-four play-off spot heats up. Seattle Reign stayed second as a 48th-minute header from the Welsh striker Jess Fishlock saw off Utah Royals and maintained a four-point gap over the chasing Thorns.• Arsenal drew 2-2 with PSG to win the friendly Toulouse International Ladies Cup. Goals from Beth Mead and Kim Little put the Gunners ahead twice before Melike Pekel pounced in injury time to level the match. Arsenal had previously beaten Montpellier 2-1.• Manchester City handed debuts to Wullaert, Weir and Bonner as they beat Barcelona 2-0 in a pre-season friendly. The breakthrough was made with 15 minutes left, Mel Lawley slotting home to give City the lead before Nikita Parris scored the second from the penalty spot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fce5c567ac4e36f45c647787492721ec58a8bd8/0_236_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cd6ecd7397c3d65e2ad56d94722fc78","title":"public experts cafe scientifique academics","story":"My Café Scientifique project brings academics and the public together in an informal setting. It has been a revelationTwenty years ago, Café Scientifique was born, borrowing from the French tradition of café philosophiques, where challenging ideas are discussed in the informal setting of a cafe or bar. That it’s still going is testament to just how much public interest academic work can have if it’s presented in an accessible way.When I started Café Scientifique with Duncan Dallas, a science television producer, we wanted to create evenings which were a bit like going to the theatre or a comedy gig, truly making science part of popular culture. But we also wanted to get people to ask challenging questions of all these scientists, medics and engineers, democratising the world of research.The concept is simple: put a speaker at the front of a bar or cafe and let them chat for 30 minutes – make sure you ban them from using PowerPoint or giving an academic lecture. A short break follows – to refresh drinks or think of a question – and then debate continues for an hour or more afterwards. Minimal cost, maximal enjoyment, and some education along the way. The idea had legs. In 2000, I used the concept as a flagship public engagement activity for our new policy, ethics and life sciences research institute in Newcastle. We joined forces with philosophers, political activists and cultural types, and now there’s a regular Café Culture event, still meeting monthly. In Norwich, the University of East Anglia has joined forces with the National Centre for Writing to create Dragon Hall Debates, bringing together a panel of three speakers on a theme, always including a writer.Elsewhere, the Wellcome Trust has been funding public engagement for several decades – and the British Academy recently held its first summer showcase. Two of the exhibits combined perspectives from science, engineering and the humanities: one investigating disability design and prosthetics, and one exploring how medieval chronicles can uncover new information about space. All of these free events are great showcases for academics of every kind: they get the chance to break out of their ivory towers and bring their research to an interested audience of members of the public.It’s so heartening to know there’s such a craving to hear from experts. But it’s not surprising, when you think of the popularity of Radio 4’s In Our Time and other ideas-driven programmes. It seems to me that academics have a responsibility to share their scholarship. Not all find it easy to talk in lay terms, but most can, and I’ve found that even Nobel prize winners and members of the Royal Society are gratified to find that there is so much general interest in their work.But organising these events isn’t always as effortless as it looks. It takes time – and a regular, monthly slot – to build an audience. It’s also crucial to find a good chair who can keep the tone light and accessible, stop the bores droning on, and encourage the shyer members of the audience to ask their own questions. Speakers need to be able to tell stories, share mysteries, and remember that facts are irresistible – as QI regularly demonstrates on the TV.To academics I’d say, just get out there and share your passion, however obscure it might seem.Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

The Berlin club night that shares his name channelled the power of this ancient mythology at its genesis in 2012, and today, the party series and record label has become a self-fulfilled prophecy: drawing from the past, while eyeing the future.Founded by Dan DeNorch and Michael Ladner, the Janus collective began as a protean dancefloor experiment, daring to ricochet between bawdy top 40 edits and frenetic rhythmic heaters, and has grown into one of the city’s most transgressive tastemakers. “We were trying to create a combination of artists that have an interesting kind of resonance between them – not necessarily tied to this canonical, genre-oriented thing,” says James Whipple, AKA resident artist M.E.S.H. When Janus began, electronic music had entered a glossy, commercialised era, churning out bombastic EDM hits with money-grabbing hubris. Underground parties in Berlin kept their subcultures segmented by booking eclectic acts. Cutting a swathe through hip-hop, grime instrumentals, baile funk, four-on-the-floor, and sound collaging everything in between, Janus rejected a singular aesthetic, allowing its artists free reign over their sets on one condition: they deliver each tonal exercise with visceral, emotional intensity.Whipple says they want a “stage and platform where multiple voices can be heard … But in a way that’s not prescribed and cheesy and moralistic. It’s still anarchy and it’s still hedonism.” His sets pivot around a techno-reminiscent 44 pattern however, it’s about “having more impactful moments, breakdowns, and silence” and “being rough with the way you play it”, a style of mixing the residents have taken on in earnest.Janus’s 53rd party took place at witching hour on a Friday in July. Stained in crimson light and staked through the heart by concrete pillars, its home venue, Säule, the experimental offspring of the superclub Berghain, has the same stern authority as its parent (and also doesn’t allow photos, hence the lack of them here). Billowy black clothing appears to be the crowd consensus, as is a shaved head. The party moved here, into the Friedrichshain neighbourhood, from its original stomping ground at the repurposed sex club Chesters in Kreuzberg, a place Whipple speculates was a filming location for swingers’ pornography. He and Tobias, alongside fellow resident DJs and expats Lotic and Kablam, played there monthly to a young art crowd, alongside showcase acts such as LA rabble-rouser Total Freedom, Lisbon’s kuduro crew Príncipe Discos, and Hyperdub kingpin Kode9. After closing Chesters at 10am, they would often slink over to Berghain to party until 2pm.Janus’s narrative would not be the same without Berghain, which is classed as a high-cultural institution by the German government. At a time when major cities often criminalise nightlife, this stamp of approval is unparalleled to Tobias, Janus’s new affiliate was an unforeseen validation. “I thought Berghain was such a specific and tight old-school thing. They were never going to let us idiots in there,” he jokes. “The day that became a thing, I thought: OK, that’s the ultimate.”Lee and Whipple view Janus as a natural outgrowth of Berlin’s nocturnal traditions. The city’s techno tourism has allowed the night to ascend into the electronic music vanguard. On any given day, there are hordes of international thrillseekers eager to check their inhibitions at the door. “Creatively and artistically, there’s this infrastructure here for club music – part of the marketing of the city is to get people to travel here and go clubbing,” Whipple says, describing how Janus gained momentum. “If you do something quite random or experimental, you’ll still get a pretty sizeable crowd just because there are so many people going out.”As per usual, gatekeepers are stationed on either side of Säule’s entrance. Two men in tight black T-shirts amble their way to the metal-framed doorway before a silent headshake has them retracing their steps in swift departure. The shorter of the duo turns around for one last appeal. “It would be a real, real honour for us to come in,” he pleads. “Sorry, not tonight,” the bouncer responds. Anticipation of the unknown proves endlessly compelling. Meanwhile, through the tenebrous interior, that elusive Janus sound blares louder.M.E.S.H.: “Primitive Art are an Italian band who have played Janus a few times. They are connected with Club Adriatico, a like-minded party in Ravenna. They have a kind of industrialised take on dub and are amazing live. They just put out a new EP on Arcola.”M.E.S.H.: “Kablam is a Janus resident and one of the hardest producers I know. Her tracks always seem harsh at home, and then you play them in a club and they turn into something really heavy and transfixing. Raw energy. Her release Furiosa was really influential I think.”Why Be: “Craxxxmurf is very Janus, whether he likes that or not, and has played a handful of events – he’s an amazing artist.”M.E.S.H.: “A track off Why Be’s Snipestreet EP, flipped with a Tink edit from the producer Mistress. I heard this edit of an edit all over the world a couple years ago. Why Be has been putting out music for a long time, ranging from very aggro club tracks to chamber music, since way before all of this kicked off. An artist who honed the ability to be rough with samples, while still creating a really focused and intense dancefloor energy.”Why Be: “A timeless and unbothered genius. Hvad played the first and the most recent Berghain event and has been the main reason why I ended up doing what I’m doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e04c212725fc71bcb17082aef23b0e1ced240e44/0_44_4804_2883/master/4804.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c89dd3c52240b9808e939d5e645b2f92","title":"bds boycott divestment sanctions movement transformed israeli palestinian debate","story":"Israel sees the international boycott campaign as an existential threat to the Jewish state. Palestinians regard it as their last resort. The movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel – known as BDS – has been driving the world a little bit mad. Since its founding 13 years ago, it has acquired nearly as many enemies as the Israelis and Palestinians combined. It has hindered the efforts of Arab states to fully break their own decades-old boycott in pursuit of increasingly overt cooperation with Israel. It has shamed the Palestinian Authority government in Ramallah by denouncing its security and economic collaboration with Israel’s army and military administration. It has annoyed the Palestine Liberation Organization by encroaching on its position as the internationally recognised advocate and representative of Palestinians worldwide.It has infuriated the Israeli government by trying to turn it into a leper among liberals and progressives. It has exasperated what is left of the Israeli peace camp by nudging the Palestinians away from an anti-occupation struggle and towards an anti-apartheid one. It has induced such an anti-democratic counter-campaign by the Israeli government that it has made Israeli liberals fear for the future of their country. And it has caused major headaches for the Palestinians’ donor governments in Europe, which are pressured by Israel not to work with BDS-supporting organisations in the Palestinian territories, an impossible request given that nearly all major civil society groups in Gaza and the West Bank support the movement.In an era of corporate social responsibility, BDS has given bad publicity to major businesses tied up in Israel’s occupation (Airbnb, ReMax, HP) and helped push other large firms out of the West Bank. It has disrupted film festivals, concerts and exhibitions around the world. It has riled academic and sports organisations by politicising them, demanding that they take a stand on the highly isive conflict. It has angered Palestinian performers and artists who work with Israeli institutions, accusing them of giving Palestinian cover for Israel’s human rights violations.In the UK, BDS has brought turmoil to courts and local councils, embroiling them in disputes over the legality of local boycotts of settlement goods. In the US, BDS has caused two dozen states to pass bills or issue orders inhibiting or penalising those boycotting Israel or its settlements, pitting Israel’s allies against free speech advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union. It has ignited debates in Protestant churches in the US, some of the largest of which have ested from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation. It has become the bane of college administrators, forced to adjudicate complaints from BDS-supporting professors and students that their free speech has been stifled, and claims by Zionist faculty, donors and undergraduates that their campuses have become “unsafe” spaces. It has pulled liberals toward greater support for the Palestinians, making Israel an increasingly partisan issue in the US, associated less with Democrats and progressives than with Trump, evangelicals and the far right.In the Jewish diaspora, BDS has created new schisms on the centre-left, which has been forced into a vice by the rightwing and pro-settlement Israeli government on one hand, and the non-Zionist left on the other. It has prompted liberal Zionists to grapple with why they sometimes accept the boycott of products from settlements but not the boycott of the state that creates and sustains them. It has compelled Israel’s more critical supporters to justify their opposition to non-violent forms of pressure on Israel, when the absence of real pressure has done nothing to bring occupation or settlement expansion to an end. It has put the onus on liberal Zionists to defend their support not for the abstract ideal of what they hope Israel might one day become, but for the actual, longstanding practices of the state, including expropriations of Palestinian land for Jewish settlement detention of hundreds of Palestinians without trial or charge collective punishment of two million Gazans living under a more than decade-long blockade and institutionalised inequality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. BDS has deprived Israel’s liberal supporters of the excuse that an aberrant occupation or rightwing governments are mainly to blame for the state’s undemocratic practices.Perhaps most significantly, BDS has challenged the two-state consensus of the international community. In so doing it has upset the entire industry of Middle East peace process nonprofit organisations, diplomatic missions and think tanks by undermining their central premise: that the conflict can be resolved simply by ending Israel’s occupation of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, leaving the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel and refugees unaddressed.For many diaspora Jews, BDS has become a symbol of evil and repository of dread, a nefarious force transforming the Israel-Palestine debate from a negotiation over the end of the occupation and the ision of territory into an argument about the conflict’s older and deeper roots: the original displacement of most of the Palestinians, and, on the ruins of their conquered villages, the establishment of a Jewish state. The emergence of the BDS movement has revived old questions about the legitimacy of Zionism, how to justify the privileging of Jewish over non-Jewish rights, and why refugees can return to their homes in other conflicts but not in this one. Above all, it has underscored an awkward issue that cannot be indefinitely neglected: whether Israel, even if it were to cease its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, can be both a democracy and a Jewish state.In the Old City of Bethlehem, down an arched pathway near the souk and Manger Square, there stands a centuries-old limestone building that now serves as the headquarters of Holy Land Trust, a Palestinian organisation devoted to nonviolent resistance to Israeli rule. Sami Awad, the non-profit’s founder, has an office on the top floor lining his shelves are books by leading theorists and practitioners of protest and civil disobedience: Gene Sharp, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr, all of whom figure prominently in his teaching, writing and even casual speech.Awad meets often with delegations of Israeli and American Jews unlike many Palestinian activists, he does not shy from discussing the Jewish connection to this land: “I can deny it till kingdom come. But it’s very deep and very emotional.” At the same time, he speaks candidly of occupation and racism, and he insists that Israel will not give Palestinians freedom unless forced to. “No oppressor group ever decides on their own just to be morally correct and change their behaviour,” he told me. “Something needs to happen: activism, resistance, boycott.”Jews and Arabs have been boycotting one another since the early days of Zionism. In the decades before Israel’s founding, the mainstream Zionist movement waged campaigns to boycott Arab workers, reject Arab produce, exclude Arabs from Jewish-only residential communities and forbid Arab purchase of Jewish-owned land. The fifth Palestine Arab Congress called for a boycott of Jewish goods in 1922. After Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, Palestinian lawyers boycotted Israeli courts, and teachers went on strike under the slogan, “no education under occupation”. Israel responded to these and other acts of civil disobedience with arrests, fines, travel restrictions, shop closures, curfews and deportations of teachers, lawyers, mayors and university presidents.Sami’s uncle, Mubarak Awad, was a pioneer of Palestinian nonviolent resistance in the 1980s: Mubarak encouraged Palestinians to send back bills written solely in Hebrew, to refuse court summonses and to fly the Palestinian flag, which was cause for arrest. Inspired by Gandhi’s boycott of British cloth, he urged the replacement of Israeli products with Palestinian ones.But it wasn’t until the first intifada, the popular uprising against occupation that began in 1987, that the programme Mubarak and others advocated found its chance for full expression. Tactics he had championed in small classrooms and academic journals were now put into widespread use by a popular movement backed by major political parties: consumers boycotted Israeli goods and services, labourers in Israeli industries refused to work, shops closed down in unison, customers withdrew funds from Israeli banks, residents refused to pay taxes and most of the Palestinian tax collectors and police resigned. The Bank of Israel reported that the Palestinian boycott had cost Israel $650m ($1.4bn today) during the first year of the uprising alone. Mubarak was charged with “fomenting a rebellion against the state” like dozens of others, he was deported by Israel during the first year of the intifada.Sami Awad was sent by his parents to Kansas in order to continue his studies. When he returned to Bethlehem in 1996, it had been transformed by the Oslo peace process. Tens of thousands of PLO officials and fighters had moved from exile in the Arab world to the West Bank and Gaza, and were now functionaries in the newly established Palestinian administration. A culture of resistance had been replaced by one of coexistence. A peace industry now flourished, as foreign funds flowed in to finance dialogue groups, NGOs and people-to-people initiatives. Awad, like most Palestinians, was optimistic that peace was on the horizon.When the second intifada erupted, in September 2000, with Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli invasions and missile attacks, the dialogue and peacemaking activities of groups such as Holy Land Trust came to a halt. For Awad, the focus was now on nonviolent resistance, which was then neither popular nor simple. It was the bloodiest period of Israeli-Palestinian fighting since the 1948 war. More than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were killed. The militarisation of the intifada had made it dangerous to confront Israel in any manner, including peacefully.As the violence of the second intifada escalated, a campaign of international solidarity with Palestinians grew. In the first months of the uprising, students at the University of California in Berkeley erected mock checkpoints and brandished banners calling to “Divest from Israeli Apartheid”. Harvard faculty signed a estment petition in 2002. In Durban, South Africa, alongside a contentious UN-sponsored World Conference Against Racism, representatives of some 3,000 NGOs called on “the international community to impose a policy of complete and total isolation of Israel as an apartheid state”. Boycott and estment campaigns spread across US, UK and European campuses, gaining the support of several Israeli academics and large numbers of Palestinians.In the West Bank and Gaza, international and Israeli activists streamed in to offer their support. Their presence tended to make the Israeli army act more cautiously, which provided a measure of protection to Palestinian demonstrators. Awad still worked with Israelis, but now insisted that any cooperation be premised not on coexistence but co-resistance, with Palestinians in the lead. He was tear-gassed, beaten and detained alongside members of direct action groups such as the International Solidarity Movement, Christian Peacemaker Teams and the Israeli-led Anarchists Against the Wall.After a week or more among Palestinian villagers, the foreign activists would return to their campuses, church groups and labour unions, explaining that there was a little-noticed Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement – and that it could be supported through estment and boycott. The first estment by a US institution of higher education, Hampshire College – also the first US school to have ested from South Africa – was spearheaded by an Israeli undergraduate named Matan Cohen, who at 17 had been shot in the eye by Israeli forces during a demonstration against the separation barrier. The nonviolent activism of the second intifada was a prelude to what would become a worldwide boycott campaign.The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement was founded with a statement of principles, known as the BDS call, on 9 July 2005. It represented something of a last resort. The Palestinians had been crushed by the military defeat of the second intifada. The living embodiment of the Palestinian national movement, Yasser Arafat, was dead. His newly installed replacement, Mahmoud Abbas, was identified more than any other Palestinian with the Oslo peace process. Though Abbas’s leadership seemed to offer a respite from the violence, it also promised a return to a strategy of diplomacy and cooperation that had done little to bring occupation to an end. If there was going to be pressure on Israel to give Palestinians freedom, it was going to have to come from the grassroots and the outside.The BDS call was made on the one-year anniversary of a historic advisory opinion by the international court of justice. The court ruled that Israel’s separation barrier was illegal, that Israel had to dismantle it “forthwith” and offer reparations to those it had harmed, and that every signatory to the fourth Geneva convention – meaning nearly every state in the world – was under an obligation to ensure Israel complied with international humanitarian law. But Israel ignored the ruling, and neither the PLO nor the international community made a real attempt to enforce the court’s findings. “If there had been action on the part of the international community to implement the ICJ ruling,” Ingrid Jaradat, a founding member of the BDS campaign, told me, “there wouldn’t have been a BDS call.”More than 170 Palestinian organisations from the occupied territories, Israel and the diaspora endorsed the BDS call. They ned the political spectrum – leftists and Islamists, supporters of two states and of one. They included the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces – the coordinating body for every significant political party – as well as major trade unions, refugee camp committees, prisoners’ societies, artistic and cultural centres and nonviolent resistance groups, among them Sami Awad’s Holy Land Trust. Twenty-nine of these entities now form the BDS National Committee, or BNC, a leadership council.The chief innovation of the BDS call was not in the tactics that it advocated: boycott and estment campaigns were already pervasive in 2005, and even sanctions and arms embargoes had been proposed previously, including by the UN general assembly. What was new about BDS was that it took disparate campaigns to pressure Israel and united them around three clear demands, with one for each major component of the Palestinian people. First, freedom for the residents of the occupied territories second, equality for the Palestinian citizens of Israel and third, justice for Palestinian refugees in the diaspora – the largest group – including the right to return to their homes.During negotiations with Israel, the PLO had agreed to each of these concessions, though few if any of them were supported by international law. When even these accommodations eventually proved insufficient to obtain an end to the occupation, growing numbers of Palestinians started to sour on the idea of two states. It wasn’t simply that the original two-state compromise had been eroded to the point of unrecognisability. It was that even the whittled-down version now seemed like a mirage.At the time of the BDS call, Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza was nearly four decades old, and showed no signs of disappearing. The number of settlers had nearly doubled since Oslo, reaching almost half a million in 2005. Many of them resided not in hilltop caravans, but in cities with shopping malls, parks, public pools and multi-lane highways connecting them seamlessly to Israel. The idea of removing even a third of this steadily growing population had come to sound implausible. The US and other powers did little more than wag their fingers. They promised the Palestinians that the situation would soon end with the founding of an independent state.Over time, the two-state solution became a slogan emptied of meaning. The less plausible it seemed, the louder it was proclaimed. But so long as it could still be imagined, the major world powers refused to demand that Israel grant the Palestinians citizenship and equal rights. The two-state concept was thus transformed from a possible solution to Israeli occupation to the primary pretext for depriving Palestinians of equality. It was also the main excuse for keeping the majority of Palestinians in exile: in order to preserve Israel’s Jewish majority, the refugees would have to languish in camps outside Israel’s borders until there was a Palestinian state that could absorb them.The BDS movement offered an alternative. It rejected talk of fictive solutions, whether of two states or one. The most fundamental problem, in its view, was not in deciding what sort of arrangement should replace the current system the problem was forcing Israel to change it at all. Debating two states versus one amounted to counting angels on the point of a pin, so long as Israel was comfortable enough in perpetual occupation to prefer it to either one.Israel’s response to BDS was slow in coming, but forceful once it arrived. Yossi Kuperwasser, who goes by the nickname Kuper, led the Israeli government’s efforts against the BDS movement until 2014. He now works for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a conservative thinktank run by Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN and a longtime confidante of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Kuperwasser, who has a grown-out buzz cut, a gruff voice and the Israeli habit of filling pauses with a grumbling “ehh”, is an engaging and emphatic interlocutor. He has good Arabic, as does his wife, Tsionit (“Zionist” in Hebrew), who was born in Israel to Iraqi Jewish parents. Kuper headed the prestigious research ision of military intelligence during the second intifada, and was appointed director general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs in 2009.It was Kuperwasser who turned the ministry into Israel’s command centre for what he calls the battle against BDS. He began the job just after the 2008-2009 Gaza war, which had killed 13 Israelis and around 1,400 Palestinians, lifting BDS activity to new heights. In September 2009, Israel’s international standing was dealt a heavy blow by the UN’s report on the war, written by a fact-finding mission headed by the eminent South African jurist Richard Goldstone. It found that Israel and Palestinian armed groups had committed war crimes, and that Israel had conducted “deliberate attacks on civilians” with “the intention of spreading terror”. It also determined that the ongoing blockade of Gaza – “the series of acts that deprive Palestinians … of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country” – constituted a possible crime against humanity.Kuperwasser said it was the Goldstone report that first alerted Israel to the grave nature of the threat posed by what it calls “delegitimisation”. In late 2009, Netanyahu identified delegitimisation as one of three critical threats to Israel, alongside Iran’s nuclear programme and the proliferation of rockets and missiles in Gaza and Lebanon. Since then, it has become common to hear senior Israeli politicians describe BDS and delegitimisation as an “existential” or “strategic” threat.Some of Israel’s centre-left commentators, all of whom oppose BDS, have nevertheless taken a rather cynical view of the government’s international campaign against BDS. They believe it is driven primarily by domestic politics. They point out that since the founding of BDS 13 years ago, Israel’s trade with the outside world has actually increased, and its diplomatic ties with India, China, African states and even the Arab world have grown. Many mainstream Israeli commentators see the BDS movement and Israeli politicians of the left and right working in symbiosis: the Israeli left threatens that BDS and delegitimisation will create an international “diplomatic tsunami” against Israel the Israeli right does its usual scaremongering about external threats in order to drum up support at home and abroad. The BDS movement, meanwhile, eagerly points to every hyperbolic Israeli statement as evidence of its own success.Kuperwasser, however, says the threat BDS poses is very real, and that ignoring it or treating it as a nuisance will fail: “Until 2010, we tried this policy, and the results were not good.” More important, he said, measuring the impact of BDS in terms of Israel’s trade was fundamentally mistaken. “The core issue is not whether they are going to boycott us or not boycott us,” Kuperwasser said. “The core issue is whether they are going to be successful in implanting in the international discourse that Israel is illegitimate as a Jewish state.”Tens of thousands of Palestinians reside in villages that predate the existence of Israel but are considered “unrecognised” by the state, facing demolitions and forcible evictions while receiving few to no basic services, including water and electricity. With the state limiting the development and expansion of Arab towns, Palestinian citizens have been forced to bid on properties in Jewish communities. But they have been repeatedly blocked. Hundreds of Jewish-only communities in Israel have admissions committees that are legally permitted to reject applicants on the basis of “social suitability”, providing cover for excluding non-Jews. “What we Palestinians in Israel face is apartheid, not discrimination,” Zoabi said. “Israel tries to say, ‘We are good Israel that has to do bad things in the West Bank and Gaza.’ No, look at how Israel treats its own citizens who don’t throw a stone!”Israel’s longstanding policies of inequality were given additional backing in the form of a July 2018 “basic law” – Israel’s version of constitutional laws – that downgrades the status of the Arabic language, states that only Jews have a right to self-determination in Israel, and declares: “The state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.”Zoabi said the PLO had forsaken its responsibilities to the Palestinian people. After formally committing to two separate states in 1988, she said, “the PLO effectively conceded Israel as a Jewish state”, with inequality between Jews and non-Jews enshrined in its laws. It was now mainly the Palestinian citizens of Israel who really challenged Zionism itself, she said, by insisting that the state could not truly be both democratic and Jewish. As a result, Palestinian citizens of Israel had become a “much bigger threat to Israel than the PLO”. She continued: “The PLO defined our struggle” – the struggle of Palestinian citizens for equality – “as an internal Israeli issue. They abandoned us!”Zoabi harshly criticized the Palestinian leadership for its role in prolonging the occupation. She blamed Mahmoud Abbas, the PLO chairman and PA president also known as Abu Mazen, for the fact that the US president Donald Trump had decided to break with decades of US policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last December. “Trump made a calculation,” she told me. “What will be the reaction to my move? All of Israel and the US said to him, correctly, that Abu Mazen will not change the rules of the game, will not end security cooperation with Israel, and will not stop Oslo. So what price will Israel or the US pay?” Zoabi said that when she travelled abroad, to countries such as Ireland, Germany and the US, “officials there told me: ‘The PLO ambassador is against your position on BDS. So who am I supposed to believe?’”Despite their totally opposing goals, the Israeli right and the leaders of the BDS movement agree on quite a lot. Both assert that at its heart the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is over Zionism and the forced exile of the majority of Palestinians in 1948, not Israel’s 1967 conquest of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank. Both contend that the settlements should not be treated differently from the government that created them. Both believe that the demands of Palestinian citizens of Israel for equality and of refugees for return are central issues of dispute, which were given insufficient attention by past peacemakers. Both say that Israel’s battle against BDS is not primarily an economic struggle. Both view the BDS movement as representative of mainstream Palestinian demands, despite acknowledging that the movement cannot mobilise large crowds and its main activists are not important figures in Palestinian politics. And both believe that the BDS movement will expose the true nature of the conflict to the world.But whereas the BDS movement is betting that this exposure will lead people to conclude that Zionism is fundamentally racist and should be rejected, Kuperwasser, for one, is convinced it is the Palestinians who will be unmasked. “The Palestinians are taking a very big risk,” he said. “Because, in my mind, there is a good chance that the world will deny their conceptual framework. People will say: ‘This is what the Palestinians want?! We are totally against it … They are crazy they want Israel to disappear.’” If that happens, he added, the Palestinians won’t even get a West Bank-Gaza state, which he believes the PLO still sees as merely the first stage toward liberating all of Palestine.In Kuperwasser’s view, the BDS movement and the Palestinian leadership share the same goals the differences between them are merely a matter of tactics. “Abu Mazen understands more than the BDS movement that you have to be subtle,” he said. The PLO’s acceptance of a two-state solution, its vows to take into account Israel’s demographic concerns, its silence on the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel – all of these, Kuperwasser added, were merely a subterfuge designed to obtain a West Bank-Gaza state, which would then serve as a launching pad for continued struggle. “The Palestinian idea of struggle is so deeply embedded in their mind that they cannot actually think about the possibility of giving up the struggle in order to make peace. I cannot tell you how many Palestinians I told, ‘Listen, with this struggle, you are paying the price much more than we do. We are flourishing. Even if we pay a price, we are flourishing.’”The key for Israel, he said, was winning the hearts and minds of centrist liberals and progressives abroad, not people who are already in the Zionist or anti-Zionist camps. What had made it more difficult, he said, was that some Israelis and Jews were guilty of “negligence and intentional giving up of the battlefield” – not the radical left, but centrists who had naively adopted the language of the enemy. Kuperwasser singled out the former Labor party prime minister Ehud Barak, who had repeatedly warned that Israel is “on a slippery slope toward apartheid” – a warning that has also been made by the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni and the former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Yitzhak Rabin. For Kuperwasser, these statements, intended to convince Israelis to make territorial concessions for peace, were above all a gift to its enemies.For the BDS movement, the charge of apartheid, which became prominent after the start of the second intifada in 2000, was not merely a provocative analogy to South Africa but a legal claim, based on the crime of apartheid as defined in international conventions and the founding statute of the international criminal court: “an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime”.The concept of apartheid became central to the BDS movement’s framing of the conflict. Whereas the Palestinian Authority sought to accentuate its autonomy and state-like characteristics, the BDS movement underlined the PA’s subservience to Israel. For proponents of the two-state model, the PA was a nationalist project working toward eventual independence, while in the apartheid framework it was merely an Israeli satrap. BDS leaders emphasised the de facto “one-state reality” of Israel-Palestine – which had become a common trope even among Israel’s supporters, many of whom were dismayed at the possibility that the country could eventually be forced to enfranchise the Palestinians living under occupation and thereby cease to be a Jewish state.Increasingly among both Israel’s centre-left friends and its enemies, the idea of a single state was not a plan for the future – to be sought or averted – but an accurate description of the reality on the ground, which was becoming more and more difficult to disentangle. Jews were already a minority in the territory under the control of Israel, which regulated the Palestinians’ borders, exports and imports, customs revenues and permits for travel and work. Legally, commercially and administratively, the Jewish and Palestinian populations were interlaced.The more deeply entrenched this one-state reality became, the more resonant the charge of apartheid, and the more difficult to imagine undoing it through partition into two states. A battle against occupation could be concluded with a simple military withdrawal, but a struggle against apartheid could be won only with the end of state policies that discriminated against non-Jews. In the case of Israel, these could be found not just in the occupied territories, but everywhere Palestinians came into contact with the state. In the West Bank, Palestinians were denied the right to vote for the government controlling their lives, deprived of free assembly and movement, forbidden from equal access to roads, resources and territory, and imprisoned indefinitely without charge. In Gaza, they could not exit, enter, import, export or even approach their borders without the permission of Israel or its ally, Egypt. In Jerusalem, they were segregated from one another and encircled by checkpoints and walls. In Israel, they were evicted from their lands, prevented from reclaiming their expropriated homes, and blocked from residing in communities inhabited exclusively by Jews. In the diaspora, they were prevented from reunifying with their families in Israel-Palestine or returning to their homes, solely because they were not Jews.Though in public, world leaders spoke endlessly of a two-state solution, privately many doubted it was still possible. They regularly condemned settlements (since these, unlike occupation, were illegal), but they did nothing to reverse settlement growth. They called for Palestinians to have freedom, but not through equal rights and citizenship in one state – because, among other reasons, international law forbids Israel from annexing territory acquired by force. They saw Israel was subverting a two-state solution and taking measures to deprive Palestinians of rights. But they wouldn’t exert any real pressure on Israel so long as it mouthed an intention to one day grant Palestinians some limited form of independence. Israel was thereby allowed to hold all the land while excluding the majority of its indigenous people, just as South Africa had aspired to do. In redefining the conflict as a case of apartheid, BDS activists saw a way out of this trap. The apartheid rubric could also undo the Palestinians’ greatest weakness – fragmentation – by uniting them in a common struggle against a single, discriminatory regime.In Gaza this January, I met Haidar Eid, a professor of literature at Al-Azhar University and a co-founder of the BDS movement in Gaza. He is in his mid-50s, compact, with a scruffy grey beard and short curly hair, and a fondness for knitted turtlenecks. Eid said that he had never seen such strain on the people of Gaza. It was weeks before Gazans would launch the Great March of Return, the weekly protests along the Gaza border fence in which Israeli snipers killed more than 100 unarmed demonstrators and wounded several thousand more.Like more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population, Eid and his family are refugees from a village in present-day Israel. He opposed the Oslo agreement because it ignored Palestinian refugees. “Oslo,” he said, “reduced the Palestinian people to residents of the West Bank and Gaza.” But it was refugees who founded the Palestinian national movement, and who accounted for the majority of Palestinians worldwide. He said, “The Palestinian issue is one thing: the right of return.”Eid’s village, Zarnuqa, was purged of its Palestinian inhabitants and no longer stands. Throughout Israel the land of refugees remains largely empty or sparsely populated, such that prominent researchers, such as the Palestinian historian Salman Abu Sitta, estimate that most could return without displacing Israelis. Eid noted that a two-state solution meant precluding most refugees from returning, since Israel refuses any possible threat to its Jewish demographic majority. (There is a myth propagated by some of Israel’s supporters that Palestinians are the only people who pass on refugee status to their children. On this basis, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have sought to cut UN assistance to millions of Palestinian refugees born after the 1948 war. In fact, granting refugee status to stateless descendants is standard practice throughout the world. The majority of registered Afghan refugees, for example, are second- and third-generation, born outside the country, as are most who have returned to Afghanistan in recent years.)Eid spent six years in Johannesburg, where he obtained his doctorate, and his English has traces of a South African accent. He compared Gaza and the Palestinian refugee camps outside Israel’s borders to the Bantustans in which black South Africans were confined under apartheid it was his view that a two-state solution would not end apartheid but rather consolidate it, creating an enfeebled, discontiguous West Bank-Gaza state that would have a dubious claim to independence.To Eid, the two-state solution was an essentially racist proposal, because it was designed to preserve a Jewish ethnic majority, with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews. He preferred a single, democratic, non-racial, non-religious state, which he said was a “huge compromise for Palestinians”, because it would give “citizenship and forgiveness to settlers and occupiers”. Eid objected to the PLO’s insincere threats to seek such an outcome, which he wrote off as a misguided attempt to scare the Israelis into accepting ethnic partition: “I mean, equality is not scary! If you are against equality and justice, you are against human rights.”Relying on states to behave morally was a lost cause, he argued they needed to be pressured by their own people from below, through BDS activism by civil society. He recalled that it had taken more than 30 years for the international community to heed the calls for boycott, estment and sanctions against apartheid South Africa, whose violent overreaction to indigenous resistance had been a prime driver of international solidarity. Just as the boycotts against South Africa had been stoked by the apartheid regime’s killings of protesters, Eid said, “the growth of BDS has been paved in Gaza’s blood. Every massacre we have in Gaza convinces me more that the only hope we have is popular resistance and BDS.”Though BDS has not had a major economic impact on Israel so far, compared to the decades-long campaign in South Africa, its ascent has been rather steep. Institutional investors such as the Dutch pension fund PGGM and the United Methodist Church have withdrawn from Israeli banks. The Presbyterian Church, the United Church of Christ, and Norway’s largest private pension fund have ested from companies profiting from Israel’s occupation. And major firms such as Veolia, Orange, G4S and CRH have fully or mostly pulled out of Israel following boycott campaigns. Dozens of student governments and numerous academic associations have endorsed boycott and estment initiatives. And many musicians and artists have cancelled shows or pledged to boycott the country.No less important, the BDS movement has effectively won the argument inside Palestine: whereas Abu Mazen had stated, in 2013, that while the PLO supports settlement boycotts, “we do not support the boycott of Israel” because “we have relations with Israel, we have mutual recognition of Israel”, by 2018 the PLO had at least rhetorically adopted BDS. International organisations, too, have been influenced by the BDS movement to move slowly from ineffectual condemnations to calls for practical measures that have some teeth. Last summer, Amnesty International called for a worldwide ban on settlement products and an arms embargo on Israel and Palestinian armed groups. Human Rights Watch called on institutional investors in Israeli banks to ensure that they are not contributing to or benefiting from settlements and other violations of international law. And the UN human rights office has compiled a list of over 200 companies – the majority based in Israel or the occupied territories, 22 based in the US – that are linked to the establishment, expansion or maintenance of Israeli settlements. In what is expected to be the most significant development in the 13-year-old BDS campaign, the UN human rights office plans to publish the names of these companies later this year.Nearly all of the corporate and student-led estments have been selective: they have not targeted Israel as a whole, but only settlements and occupation. A number of them had little to do with the BDS movement itself. But both the Israeli government and the BDS movement have tended to obscure this fact. Doing so has helped the BDS movement appear to rack up victories, and it has helped the Israeli government to discredit cautious bureaucratic initiatives to adhere to international law, casting them instead as unhinged, demonising efforts by BDS radicals.Conflating boycotts of the settlements with opposition to Israel’s existence has been a central element of the government’s policy, reflecting a desire not just to protect settlements but to stem the tide of selective boycotts that could spread to Israel as a whole. “We are saying there is no difference between a settlement boycott and a boycott of Israel,” Yossi Kuperwasser said. “If you want to promote the boycotting of Israel, any part of Israel, you are not a friend of Israel. You are actually an enemy of Israel. So we have to deal with you.”The government has passed a law that bars entry to foreigners who have publicly supported a boycott of Israel “or an area under its control”. Its minister of strategic affairs has called for imposing financial penalties on Israeli organisations, companies and in some cases iniduals who advocate boycotts of either Israel or the settlements. After Hagai El-Ad, the head of the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, addressed the UN security council and called on it to take action against Israel’s occupation, the chairman of the governing coalition called to revoke his citizenship and to create a bill that would do the same to any Israeli who calls on international bodies to take action against Israel.This deliberate elision of Israel and the settlements has caused no small amount of consternation among the state’s more liberal supporters in the American Jewish community. For years they have sought to protect Israel itself from sanction, by arguing that only boycotts of settlements are legitimate. Now they feel themselves under attack not just from BDS, on the left, but the Israeli government, on the right, both of which disdain the centre-left notion of being “pro-Israel and anti-occupation”, and both of which reject the position that wine produced in West Bank settlements should be boycotted while the government that created, financed and maintained the settlements should not.Israel’s strategy has been to force a choice on companies subjected to pressure to withdraw or est: stay in Israeli-controlled territory and ignore the boycott campaign, or accede to its demands and face potential lawsuits and losses in much bigger markets in Europe and the US. Given that choice, Kuperwasser said, most companies would be very reluctant to withdraw from Israel or the settlements: “But if it’s going to happen, there are going to be more laws around the world that are going to make these companies suffer. We can retaliate and come up with a response.”The Ministry of Strategic Affairs has outsourced much of its anti-BDS activity in foreign countries, helping to establish and finance front groups and partner organisations, in an attempt to minimise the appearance of Israeli interference in the domestic politics of its allies in Europe and the US. Kuper said that anti-BDS groups were now “sprouting like mushrooms after the rain”. He and a number of other former intelligence and security officials are members of one of them, Kella Shlomo, described as a “PR commando unit” that will work with and receive tens of millions of dollars from the Ministry of Strategic Affairs. In 2016, Israel’s embassy in London sent a cable to Jerusalem complaining that the strategic affairs ministry was endangering British Jewish organisations, most of which are registered as charities and forbidden from political activity: “‘operating’ Jewish organisations directly from Jerusalem … is liable to be dangerous” and “could encounter opposition from the organisations themselves, given their legal status Britain isn’t the US!” Last year, al-Jazeera aired undercover recordings of an Israeli official working out of the London embassy, who described being asked by the Ministry of Strategic Affairs to help establish a “private company” in the UK that would work for the Israeli government and in liaison with pro-Israel groups like Aipac.To Israeli liberals, the gravest threat from BDS is that it has induced in their government a reaction so reckless and overreaching that it resembles a sort of auto-immune disease, in which the battle against BDS also damages the rights of ordinary citizens and the organs of democracy. Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs has utilised the intelligence services to surveil and attack delegitimisers of Israel. It called to establish a blacklist of Israeli organisations and citizens who support the nonviolent boycott campaign, created a “tarnishing unit” to besmirch the reputations of boycott supporters, and placed paid articles in the Israeli press. Leftwing Israeli Jews have been summoned for interrogation or stopped at the border by agents of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, who described themselves as officers working against delegitimisation. Israel has banned 20 organisations from entry for their political opinions, including the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that won a Nobel peace prize for helping Holocaust refugees and that now supports self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians while also endorsing BDS.Last year, the Israeli intelligence minister, Yisrael Katz, called publicly for “targeted civil assassinations” of activists such as the BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti, a permanent resident of Israel. Barghouti was also threatened by Israel’s minister of public security and strategic affairs: “Soon any activist who uses their influence to delegitimise the only Jewish state in the world will know they will pay a price for it … We will soon be hearing more of our friend Barghouti.” Not long after, Barghouti was prevented from exiting the country, and last year Israeli authorities searched his home and arrested him for tax evasion.Perhaps Israel’s most powerful tool in the campaign against delegitimisation has been to accuse the country’s critics of antisemitism. Doing so required changing official definitions of the term. This effort began during the final years of the second intifada, in 2003 and 2004, as pre-BDS calls to boycott and est from Israel were gaining steam. At that time, a group of institutes and experts, including Dina Porat – a Tel Aviv University scholar who had a been a member of the Israeli foreign ministry’s delegation to the 2001 UN world conference against racism in Durban, South Africa – proposed creating a new definition of antisemitism that would equate criticisms of Israel with hatred of Jews.These experts and institutions, working with the American Jewish Committee and other Israel advocacy groups, formulated a new “working definition” of antisemitism, including a list of examples, that was published in 2005 (and later discarded) by an EU body for combating racism. This working definition was adapted in 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), and has been used, endorsed or recommended, with some small modifications, by a number of other organisations – including the US Department of State, which, since 2008, has defined antisemitism to include any of three categories of criticism of Israel, known as the “three Ds”: delegitimisation of Israel, demonisation of Israel and double standards for Israel. (More recently, the IHRA working definition has been at the centre of the antisemitism controversy in the Labour party, which adopted a modified version of the examples accompanying the definition.)By the state department’s definition, delegitimisation includes “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist”. Thus anti-Zionism – including the view that Israel should be a state of all its citizens, with equal rights for Jews and non-Jews – is a form of delegitimisation and therefore antisemitic. According to this definition, virtually all Palestinians (and a large proportion of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel, who oppose Zionism for religious reasons) are guilty of antisemitism because they want Jews and Palestinians to continue living in Palestine but not within a Jewish state. Kuperwasser, for one, stands by the charge: “Anti-Zionism and antisemitism are the same lady in a different cloak.”The second D, demonisation, includes “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” – as the Israeli army’s deputy chief of staff did during a Holocaust remembrance day speech in 2016, likening the “revolting trends” in Europe and Germany in the 1930s and 40s to tendencies visible in Israel today. The last of the three Ds, applying double standards, holds that singling Israel out for criticism is “the new antisemitism”. Yet practically every earlier estment and boycott initiative around the world could be accused of double standards, including the campaign against apartheid South Africa, most of whose proponents ignored graver transgressions elsewhere, such as the concurrent genocides in Cambodia, Iraqi Kurdistan and East Timor.The new definition of antisemitism has been frequently deployed against Israel’s critics in the US, especially on university campuses. Israel advocacy groups have urged several universities to adopt the state department definition. At Northeastern University in Boston and the University of Toledo in Ohio, pro-Israel students and advocacy groups attempted to thwart even discussing boycott and estment, arguing that it would create an antisemitic climate on campus. The California legislature passed a resolution in 2012 to regulate speech on California campuses it cited examples of antisemitism that included not just delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel but also “student- and faculty-sponsored boycott, estment and sanctions campaigns against Israel”.In 2015, an anonymous website, Canary Mission, began publishing lists of pro-Palestinian students who support estment, often accusing them of antisemitism the Israeli government has used Canary Mission profiles to interrogate and deny entry to pro-BDS US citizens. On several campuses, pro-Israel groups have intimidated pro-Palestinian students and faculty by placing names from the Canary Mission website on posters that state: “The following students and faculty … have allied themselves with Palestinian terrorists to perpetrate BDS and Jew Hatred on this campus.”Kuperwasser was unapologetic about the perceived excesses of Israel’s anti-BDS campaign at home and abroad. He was confident that Israel was taking the right approach and would succeed, as it had against past assaults: “We won the war on the conventional battlefield. To start with, our chances were very slim. We won the war on terror. Again, it wasn’t easy. I remember when we went to the big battle – the second intifada – and many generals around the world were telling me, ‘Listen, Kuper, you’re wasting your time: nobody ever won a war against terrorism,’ citing Vietnam and other cases. And I said: ‘No, we shall win this war as well. We are innovative and determined enough. And unlike many other battles, we don’t have a second option, an alternative. We have to win.’ The same goes here. We shall win.”Because the BDS movement opposes a state with legally sanctioned discrimination against non-Jews and therefore rejects the idea of a Jewish state, many diaspora Jews view the threat it poses as existential. Thanks in no small part to the BDS movement, the Israel-Palestine debate is transforming from a question of how to end Israel’s occupation, which most liberal Jews do not support, to a referendum on the legitimacy of Israel, which they consider a settled fact that they shouldn’t have to defend.Beneath this principled opposition, there are also more visceral misgivings. One of the primary apprehensions of liberal Zionists about the BDS movement is what they consider to be its strident tone and uncompromising positions. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the head of T’ruah, a rabbinic human rights organisation that works in both Israel and the US, said that she “straddles the line between progressive groups where Zionist is a bad word and pro-Israel groups where occupation is a bad word”. She said she felt alienated by the hostility of the BDS movement, which at times seemed to her downright gleeful as it publicised Israel’s misdeeds. “BDS is triggering 2,000 years of Jewish trauma and 70 years of post-Holocaust trauma,” she said. David Shulman, a renowned Indologist, Hebrew University professor, and activist with Ta’ayush (“co-existence”), a leftwing Israeli-Palestinian group that protects Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks, said that his biggest problem with BDS was “the virulent tonality” of it: “I understand it is a heterogeneous movement. But so much of it is based on hatred, which is a terrible basis for political action.”Many liberal Zionists recoil not just at the vehemence of some BDS activists, but also at their occasional conflation of Israel and the Jewish people, which they feel smacks of antisemitism. Simone Zimmerman, a co-founder of the American Jewish anti-occupation group IfNotNow, said she found the Israeli government no less guilty of the charge: “Bibi Netanyahu goes around the world saying, ‘I am here to represent the Jewish people, and the IDF is doing what it’s doing on behalf of all the Jewish people in the world.’ And the American Jewish Committee and Aipac say we’re doing what we’re doing to keep the Jews safe. I find it hard to make the case that our critics should be more nuanced than we are ourselves.”In the US and Europe, liberal Jews feel as alienated by the anti-Zionist BDS movement as by the illiberal supporters of Israeli policies they deplore. Last fall, the rightwing Zionist Organization of America feted Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser whose ex-wife, in a sworn court declaration, recalled his complaint that their daughters’ school had too many Jews. Bannon had proclaimed himself a “Christian Zionist”. The “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer, an organiser of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at which white supremacists had chanted “Jews will not replace us”, had also declared himself a sort of Zionist, inspired by Israel’s example as an exclusionary ethnic state. Last year he said to an Israeli television interviewer: “You could say I’m a white Zionist in the sense that I care about my people. I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves, just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.”The alliance between Israel’s allies and ultra-nationalists in Europe and the US has become a central theme of the BDS campaign’s messages. In this respect, the Trump era has been good for the movement. So has the Netanyahu government, whose attacks on BDS have been among the greatest drivers of publicity and recruitment for the campaign.Jacobs said that it had become harder and harder to be pro-Israel and anti-occupation in progressive spaces. “On the left, support for BDS is a litmus test: either you support it or you have no place.” To progressives, centre-left pro-Israel groups are increasingly viewed as Aipac-lite, supporting two states in name while in practice protecting Israel from any sort of pressure that might induce it to end a very comfortable occupation.Sharon Brous, a leading progressive rabbi in the US, told me, “I am not supportive of BDS, but I think we haven’t treated it correctly. Boycott is a tool that we in the Jewish community use often. It is nonviolent.” American progressives have advocated a number of domestic boycotts in recent years – including one against the state of North Carolina, over a controversial anti-LGBT law. Mouin Rabbani, a senior fellow with the Institute for Palestine Studies who is not active in the BDS movement, told me, “All these years we heard Israel and its supporters ask, ‘Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?’ And then when faced with a totally nonviolent Palestinian boycott campaign, they say they can’t support it.”Simone Zimmerman, the IfNotNow co-founder, said: “If you ask a random American Jew on the street, ‘Do you believe that people in their society shouldn’t discriminate based on ethnic heritage, and all people should have access to all the basic rights that you care about in America?’, they’d probably say yes. And then it comes to Israel, and they say: ‘Equality for all people? You’re trying to wipe Israel off the face of the map!’”In Jaffa one Saturday afternoon, I met Kobi Snitz, a mathematician who works at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and is a member of Boycott from Within, a group of pro-BDS Israelis, most of whom are Jews. Snitz is a veteran activist who has been participating in West Bank demonstrations with Palestinians since the second intifada. He has been arrested numerous times and spent many years protesting alongside the family of Ahed Tamimi, who has become a symbol of Palestinian unarmed resistance, following her arrest last December, at age 16, for slapping Israeli soldiers who entered her property shortly after the army shot her 15-year-old cousin in the head at close range. Kobi said that the protests he had joined in Tamimi’s village, Nabi Saleh, had dwindled over the years, as had non-violent resistance in the West Bank more generally. “It’s amazing that it lasted as long as it did,” he said. “Four died in Nabi Saleh, hundreds were injured, and roughly a third of the village was detained or jailed. For a village of 500 people to put up that kind of resistance on its own for that long is extraordinary. But, yes, eventually it dies down and dwindles. Oppression works. Terror works.”Snitz drove me, in a beat-up old sedan, to a lunch of Sudanese lentils in Neve Sha’anan, the poor south Tel Aviv neighbourhood that is home to many African asylum seekers. We were the only non-Africans in the restaurant or on the street. At bottom, he explained, boycott was a peaceful tactic of resisting immoral repression the refusal to cooperate with gross injustice, he argued, was the minimum required of a person of conscience. As we drove back to Jaffa, passing a prison in which Snitz had been detained, he paraphrased words he had heard from the BDS co-founder, Omar Barghouti. “Omar said: ‘Look, I don’t want the west to come and save us. I’m not asking for the west to come invade Israel. I’m just asking it to stop supporting our oppression.’” Snitz added: “It’s true that this conflict is not special in how bad the violations are. What is special is how much the liberal west actively supports them.”• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37830ca6c9c8b05679ed37f2ad645ee621bbe5a8/0_190_873_524/master/873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2838d9263a9b415318ec7e483986cc38","title":"jeremy corbyn not involved munich olympics massacre wreath laying","story":"Labour leader rows with Israeli PM over ceremony for iniduals from group behind Munich massacreJeremy Corbyn has said he was present but not involved at a wreath-laying for iniduals behind the group that carried out the Munich Olympic massacre, a partial admission that has led to a row with Israel’s prime minister.The Labour leader had been asked if Palestinian leaders linked to the Black September terror group were also honoured at a memorial event he attended in Tunisia in 2014, at which victims of the 1985 Israeli airstrike in Tunis were remembered.Corbyn said “a wreath was indeed laid” for “some of those who were killed in Paris in 1992” and added in response to a question: “I was present at that wreath-laying, I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”Jeremy Corbyn has said that he was present but not involved at a wreath-laying for people behind the group that carried out the Munich Olympics massacre.The row centres on a wreath-laying event in Tunisia for two separate groups, both the victims of a 1985 Israeli airstrike in Tunis and for the Palestinian leaders linked to the Black September terror group who killed Israeli athletes.There are memorials to the victims of the 1985 bombing and a four graves for leading figures from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, thought to have been behind the Black September group, in different parts of the cemetery.Corbyn was attending a conference in Tunisia called the International Conference on Monitoring the Palestinian Political and Legal Situation in the Light of Israeli Aggression.In an article for the Morning Star in 2014, shortly after his visit, Corbyn said he was present for a ceremony honouring the 1985 victims and “others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991”.The Palestine Liberation Organisation’s intelligence chief Atef Bseiso – who has been accused of involvement in the Munich Olympics massacre – was killed in Paris in 1992, purportedly by Mossad. No-one was killed in Paris in 1991, so Corbyn may just have got the wrong date.On Saturday, the Daily Mail published pictures of Corbyn holding a wreath at the Palestinian Martyrs’ Cemetery in Tunisia.The paper said that its own visit to the cemetery had shown that the memorial for the victims of the 1985 bombing was 15 yards away from the spot where Corbyn was pictured holding a wreath.The story claims the pictures were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of the Black September and yards from the grave of Bseiso.Corbyn said that “a wreath was indeed laid” for “some of those who were killed in Paris in 1992” and added, in response to a question: “I was present at that wreath-laying, I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”He added: “I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere.Labour has said that Corbyn had already made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks indicate he was at least aware of another wreath-laying at the memorial event.Corbyn was speaking two days after the Daily Mail unearthed pictures of the Labour MP holding a wreath at the event, near the graves of four Palestinian leaders believed to be connected to Black September, which carried out the terror attack on Israelis at the 1972 Olympics, in which 11 people died.Labour previously said Corbyn had made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli airstrike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks, the first time he has spoken since the Mail story on Saturday, indicate that another wreath-laying took place at the memorial event.A few hours after Corbyn spoke, Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement via his official Twitter account criticising the Labour leader. “The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between,” the Israeli prime minister wrote.Labour said Netanyahu’s criticism was “false” and Corbyn responded by attacking the Israeli prime minister for presiding over the deaths of scores of people in Gaza. A party spokesman said: “Jeremy did not lay any wreath at the graves of those alleged to have been linked to the Black September organisation or the 1972 Munich killings. He of course condemns that terrible attack, as he does the 1985 bombing.”Shortly after, Corbyn, via his own Twitter feed, stepped up his response to Netanyahu. “What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children,” the Labour leader wrote.The wreath-laying took place at an event at the Palestinian martyrs’ cemetery in Tunisia during a visit by Corbyn in 2014, a year before he became the party’s leader. There is a memorial to the victims of the 1985 bombing at the cemetery, although it is described as being 15 yards away from where Corbyn was pictured.A couple of metres behind where Corbyn and the group of people are standing are four graves of senior members of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, thought to have been behind the Black September group. One of those belongs to Atef Bseiso, the PLO’s head of intelligence, who was assassinated outside a Paris hotel in 1992, and was allegedly killed by the Israeli secret service in revenge for the 1972 attack.Another is the grave of Salah Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, who was the second in command in the PLO at the time of his death and is the most senior Palestinian figure buried in the Tunisian cemetery. Khalaf, who is believed to have been a key figure behind Black September, was killed in Tunis in 1991, alongside two other figures who are also buried in the graveyard.The Labour MP Luciana Berger said Corbyn needed to apologise. “Being ‘present’ is the same as being involved. When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. There can also never be a ‘fitting memorial’ for terrorists. Where is the apology?” she said.Over the weekend, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, called on Corbyn to resign over the issue as the Conservatives sought to capitalise on the row.The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said Corbyn should apologise and accused the Labour leader of being “evasive”.Marie van der Zyl told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “After days of being evasive, Jeremy Corbyn has now admitted attending a memorial event for the terrorist murders of unarmed athletes. How can you say he is not involved?“In 1972, these are unarmed people who were attending the Olympics, they were savagely mutilated and murdered. There is no reason Jeremy Corbyn should not apologise to the widows and to the victims for this terrible massacre … He needs to also recognise that he can’t cavort with terrorists.” It is not the first time the event in Tunisia has been the subject of controversy. In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Michael Fallon, then the defence secretary, said his presence there showed that Corbyn was “unfit” to be prime minister.Fallon’s accusation was based on an account given by Corbyn about the trip in the Morning Star newspaper in October 2014. He wrote: “Wreaths were laid to mark the 1985 bombing of the PLO HQ and on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991.” He appears to have made a mistake about the dates because the only person killed in Paris was Bseiso in 1992.The controversy emerges at a time when Labour is embroiled in a row about antisemitism and whether the party will adopt in full, with all its examples, the definition produced by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).Corbyn said in the same interview that the Labour party would consult with the Jewish and Palestinian communities over whether to adopt one remaining example attached to the IHRA definition.Striking a conciliatory tone, he said Labour had agreed to the IHRA definition and almost all of its 11 examples. “The one example that we are discussing and consulting on is one that makes sure that you can discuss and debate the relations between Israel and Palestine, the future of the peace process and, yes, make criticisms of the actions of the Israeli government in the bombing of Gaza and other places,” Corbyn said. “But you can never make those criticisms with antisemitic language or antisemitic intentions. And that is what we are absolutely clear on.”His remarks confirmed that Labour had dropped its objections to three other examples attached to the IHRA code. The remaining sticking point is the example that states “claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour” is antisemitic – because of concerns in the party about hindering legitimate criticism of the creation of Israel.The Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the only way “Jeremy Corbyn can put this issue to bed” is to “adopt the internationally agreed definition of antisemitism in full”. She said: “Until he does that, incidents such as his presence at the laying of wreaths at the graves of those responsible for torturing and murdering innocent Jewish Israeli athletes in Munich will continue to emerge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7548cf3b1973582bc283e97b95e203a432bd97/0_173_5200_3119/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b50040b73172f3db8e5c8829764cd004","title":"social housing green paper tenants to gain powers against rogue landlords","story":"Campaigners say green paper proposals fail to tackle urgent need for more affordable homesSocial housing residents will be empowered to take on rogue landlords under the government’s new strategy, but campaigners have criticised the document which offers no new funding.However, the paper will say no social housing tenant should feel a “stigma” about council renting and the department said it would “challenge the stereotypes that exists about residents and their communities.”Housing campaigners including Shelter and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said the reforms would not be effective without substantial new funding for council house building.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, called the proposals “pitiful” and said they failed to tackle the crucial question of a lack of supply, as the number of new social rented homes built last year hit the lowest level since records began.“The number of new social rented homes is at a record low but there is no new money to increase supply and ministers are still preventing local authorities run by all parties from building the council homes their communities need,” he said.JRF’s chief executive Campbell Robb said: “The lack of concrete plans to build significantly more truly affordable homes risks failing a generation. Against a backdrop of rising food bank use, families on low incomes will continue to face impossible choices about whether to pay the rent or put food on the table.“We urge the government to invest in 80,000 genuinely affordable homes a year at the next spending review to put things right.”Shelter’s chief executive, Polly Neate, said the green paper was “full of warm words but doesn’t commit a single extra penny towards building the social homes needed by the 1.2 million people on the waiting list.”The Local Government Association said the reforms were “a small step, compared with the huge and immediate need for more genuinely affordable homes”.LGA’s housing spokeswoman Judith Blake said: “The government must go beyond the limited measures announced so far, scrap the housing borrowing cap, and enable all councils across the country to borrow to build once more. This would trigger the renaissance in council housebuilding which will help people to access genuinely affordable housing.”The green paper, launched by the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, on Tuesday, will introduce new performance indicators and league tables of housing providers, which the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said would “rebalance the landlordtenant relationship to hold bad practice to account”.The government has said it will give new teeth to the housing watchdog to ensure social homes are well-managed, moves inspired by the Grenfell Tower fire in west London.Ed Daffarn, a survivor of last year’s Grenfell Tower fire and member of the Grenfell United campaign group, cautiously welcomed some of the ideas but said residents were cautious about the effectiveness of league tables.“Social housing is not like choosing a doctor – you can’t just up sticks and move if your housing association gets a low rating,” he said. “Much more is needed to put power in residents’ hands. We need a new regulation system that will be proactive and fight for residents, with real repercussions for housing associations or councils that fail in their duty.”The green paper will drop plans to force the sale of council homes in areas with high-value properties, the  understands, a proposal from 2015 which had been fiercely opposed by councils.Blake said it would be a relief for councils. “We have worked hard to demonstrate the need to scrap this policy which would have forced councils to sell off large numbers of the homes desperately needed by low-income families in our communities,” she said.Under plans unveiled in 2015, local authorities were required to sell millions of pounds worth of council homes to fund discounts for the right-to-buy scheme for housing association tenants. Shelter had estimated it could force the sale of 23,500 council homes in England in just one year.Social housing regulation is still under review, as is right-to-buy where the government is consulting on reforming the rules governing the use of receipts from the sale of council housing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe7059c2f899f5dbfbc2046dee4677326433344/114_133_3277_1966/master/3277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596cf195e86303985889419552655063","title":"dina asher smith european championships","story":"• Neil Black thinks there is more to come from the sprinter• Asher-Smith’s coach John Blackie credited with key roleDina Asher-Smith’s “out of this world” treble at the European Championships was the best display by a British track competitor in a generation, according to the UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black.Asher-Smith will go for 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold medals again at next year’s world championships and Black, who has worked in the sport for 26 years, said her rivals would be “crazy” to underestimate her.“We knew that Dina had loads of talent,” he said. “But what she’s done is incredible. It’s better than anything I’ve seen in my time at UK Athletics, really. She has been so focused, so determined, so professional and so calm. She is a pleasure to have around and has really demonstrated to everyone else in the team how to go about performing at the highest level.”Asher-Smith started by breaking her British 100m record, repeated the trick in the 200m, before topping off her week by taking the team from fourth to first in the 4x100m to clinch her third gold of the championships on Sunday night.Black believes she can go even faster. “There is more to come, and she knows that,” he added. “I honestly think this is the beginning. I think she is going to run even faster. And I am absolutely sure all her competitors across the world have finally registered what she can do. When you put Dina’s multiple gold medal-winning and world-leading, world-class times together, if they are not fearful, if they are not respectful, then they must be crazy.”Black attributed Asher-Smith’s victories to a combination of great genetics, hard work and determination, as well as the efforts of her coach, John Blackie. “They have worked together for years and she believes in him and vice versa,” Black said. “He knows how to get the best out of her. I remember a conversation a couple of years ago, and she said: ‘John knows how to get the best out of me.’“On the surface she is this lovely, butter-wouldn’t-melt person but underneath it she is ruthless when she needs to be. She works out with real clarity what needs to be done and I don’t think she lets anything get in the way.”As bookmakers cut Asher-Smith’s odds to win the BBC sports personality of the year from 50-1 to 9-1, behind Harry Kane, Geraint Thomas and Anthony Joshua, she was also lauded as a “key player” in the sport going into the Tokyo 2020 Olympics by the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe.“The great thing about Dina is that she just clearly loves big championship racing,” Coe said. “But she’s also got a real hinterland. I talked to her a few years ago and we were chatting about the fact she was doing a history degree and that her dissertation was on the impact jazz has had on social integration. It shows there are other things in her world and that will stand her in good stead when the pressure’s really on.”Toni Minichiello, who brilliantly guided Jess Ennis-Hill to Olympic gold at London 2012, said it is important Asher-Smith does not try to change too much as she gears up for Tokyo. “She has run phenomenal times and is well capable of becoming a world star,” he said. “She just has to not overcook it. Sometimes when you step up to an even higher level you think you have to train more and do things differently. But you have just got to add a little bit at a time and let mother nature do its thing.“Dina is only 22 so she doesn’t need to go crazy with the training, or the commercial offers and publicity she is going to get. I know after 2009 when Seb Coe labelled Jess as the face of London 2012 we were unprepared for things that flooded in. Dina will have to be selective so she can spend the time training and not be distracted, but she’s smart enough to know that.”Black praised the rest of the British team, who arrived back from Berlin on Monday with 18 medals, including seven golds, and said they were ready to take on the world. In particular he praised the heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who recovered from a calf injury to take silver in a new personal best.“Everybody has had doubts. She has had doubts,” he said, “but Kat has matured and her confidence and decision-making have made her a much better competitor.”There were also warm words for Zharnel Hughes and Matt Hudson-Smith, who won the 100m and 400m, as well as Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Adam Gemili, who were key members of the men’s 4x100m team.“I have no doubt we have a strong crop of genuine potential global medallists and we have seen some of them in Berlin,” Black added. “I just think very positive thoughts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a287fd2273b45fb0487cc024948b5fbeeab02e3/117_385_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49806378ce1b8935637eee44c1889a98","title":"talking horses formula one ffos las hugo palmer","story":"Hugo Palmer’s son of Frankel can live up to his speedy name at Ffos Las alongside improving handicapper GarbanzoHugo Palmer’s horses have hit top form of late with impressive victories from Gifted Master in the Stewards’ Cup and the visually stunning performance of Unforgetable Filly at Haydock last weekend when taking apart a smart field to come home unchallenged by eight lengths.The Newmarket handler is responsible for Tuesday’s nap selection, Formula One (4.15), who is cleverly named by Frankel out of Whizz Kid. His only run to date, at Newcastle last month, saw him finish a highly creditable second to Mister Ambassador, with five lengths and more back to the rest of the field, in which impressive handicap winner Whitlock was fourth.Given that Palmer’s newcomers always come on for their first run, then the selection should prove very tough to beat in the mile and a half novice stakes at Ffos Las.Half an hour later on the same card a fellow Newmarket trainer, Ed Walker, looks to have found an ideal opportunity for his progressive handicapper Garbanzo (4.45) to make it back-to-back wins. Having shown very little form in his previous five runs, the son of Mastercraftsman was sent off the well-backed 2-1 favourite at Doncaster last month for a mile and a half handicap and he sluiced home four-and-a-half lengths clear.For that dominant display he has been raised a very fair seven pounds, and I am sure his trainer would agree it could have been more. Clearly the key was the trip, a full quarter mile further than he had run before and at the Welsh course on Tuesday it is a further two furlongs, which has to be a big point in his favour.Karl Burke is enjoying a superb season with several major races in the bag, including Laurens’ dogged victory in the Prix de Diane (French Oaks). She is on course for the Yorkshire Oaks at next week’s Ebor meeting, along with a strong supporting cast from the North Yorkshire yard.The Spigot Lodge trainer has an interesting runner at Nottingham on Tuesday in the guise of Divinity (6.05). This beautifully-bred filly got the hang of things late-on when making her debut at Thirsk in July when staying on to finish sixth of 13. She faces the winner of that race, Sootability, on seven pounds better terms and I understand she has improved quite a bit for that run and connections believe she will be much more competitive this time. The Dutch Art filly only faces four opponents but could go off at an attractive price.Charlie Hills has endured something of a drought during the hot summer months but it would appear that whatever was holding them back is behind them now as his most recent runners have been running much better. Battash gave them a huge boost at Glorious Goodwood and things have continued to go forward with four winners last weekend, including a 25-1 first time out runner – Red Bravo.Tips by John O\u0027HaraThe Lambourn trainer has some interesting Tuesday runners worth keeping an eye out for – Tafawoq, Dark Jedi and Brawny.

Top comedians relive their first fringe gigDave GormanI was 19 and nowhere near ready. I had a decent enough act – if there was a full house and everyone was up for it. But I had none of the skills needed for working a small, arms-folded, go-on-prove-it audience. Luckily, the only reviewer who came along didn’t hear my name and reviewed me under the title of the double act I’d replaced at the last minute. “Brute Farce,” wrote the critic, “is a strange young man who mumbles as he walks about the stage.” They’re probably still peeved.Dave Gorman’s With Great Powerpoint Comes Great Responsibilitypoint tour starts in September.My show was called The Cheese Roll and it climaxed with me re-enacting Gloucester’s famous cheese-rolling competition using a papier-mache model of Cooper’s Hill with two tiny figures and a mini Babybel. It was 2006 and I was on at 12pm in the back room of the Holyrood Tavern. No one came.One day, though, I managed to get a small crowd together because my supportive sister Eileen had come all the way from Gloucester and I didn’t want her to be the only person in the audience. When we got there, the doors were locked. My audience began to arrive and we all waited on the pavement together for ages – in the rain. It turned out the bar manager had gone clubbing the night before and overslept. So everyone left without seeing the show and Eileen got her train home.Bridget Christie: What Now? is on a UK tour.One show marked the bleakest point of my entire comedy career. Five people came and they’d won their tickets off the radio. After 15 minutes, they all walked out together, leaving just me and the tech guy. That was an interesting philosophical dilemma. Was this still a show? Should I just keep on going? Maybe they’ve all gone for a wee and will come back?When a team goes out of the World Cup, there’s this crouched position players go into where they just stare at a fixed point. I recall doing that. My tech hugged me and we had 45 minutes to kill, so we went for the maximum amount of beer you can drink in that time.In Edinburgh you always have another show the next night so there isn’t too long to lick your wounds. Some nights the show absolutely flew. There is no such thing as an overnight success in comedy. It takes years to get any good. You’re forged in fire. And Edinburgh is the hottest fire of all.David O’Doherty: You Have to Laugh is at Assembly George Square theatre.My first solo show was called What Would Beyoncé Do? and it was life-changing. I was performing above a pub, an incredibly sweaty 60-seater. The first time I showed up, there was a queue. “What are you here for?” I asked. They replied: “The Beyoncé show.” I was like: “Oh, OK! Wait there!” I ended up having to turn away 70 to 80 people a night, if not more. It got ridiculous. When the judges for the comedy awards first came, they couldn’t get in.Luisa Omielan: Politics for Bitches is at Gilded Balloon Teviot.It was 2011 and I was in a midday show called The Lunchtime Club. The Tron, where we were performing, was broken into one night so John Kearns – one of my three fellow performers – went on stage the next day and pretended to be a policeman. He interrogated the audience and they loved it.You’d smash it one day and die on your arse the next. But that’s the best way to learn. I remember being in awe of people who were doing a full hour. I did 15 minutes a day with the Lunchtime Club and we got one review that said: “I’d be astounded if any of these comedians becomes a professional comic.”Suzi Ruffell: Nocturnal is at the Pleasance Courtyard.Worryingly, I was given a 120-seat venue. I sold out once in the course of the month and was delighted. Then I got a review so scathing and personal I can almost repeat it word-for-word a decade later. Weirdly, it still gave me three stars. I remember that first fringe being the most intense thing I’d ever done, but at the end of it people told me I’d had a really good year. I thought: “I don’t want to know what a bad year feels like.” And then the following year I found out.Felicity Ward: Busting a Nut is at the Pleasance Courtyard.I was reading modern and medieval languages at Cambridge and in 1979 hitchhiked to Edinburgh to perform with the university’s Mummers troupe. I played Jack Dapper in A Roaring Girl, a kind of proto-feminist Jacobean play. There was a kids’ show, too, a duologue by Stephen Fry, and Simon McBurney was there as well. It was a charmed time. We were all young and beautiful, 18 of us sleeping in the same space in a rented flat. We won the Scotsman’s Fringe First award.Edinburgh is still a joyous and exciting place to be. The fringe programme is now 14ft thick but back then it was very slim indeed. In 1981 I was lucky enough to work with Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson when we did the Cellar Tapes revue. It won the inaugural Perrier award. It was televised on BBC2 which was great. What else did we get? A case of Perrier each and a London run in the New End theatre in Hampstead which was a converted morgue with a capacity of about 70. But it was still gorgeousTony Slattery’s Crimes Against Improv is at the Stand and Slattery Will Get You Nowhere is at the Stand’s New Town theatre.I was on a mixed bill of rookie comics. After a few days, the reality of the situation dawned on me: I was paying a fortune to sleep in a cupboard and perform to 10 drunks a night in a temporarily repurposed Sea Cadets hut. And that day I’d spent three hours out in the rain, attempting to hand out pictures of myself to impervious tourists.I snapped. I sat on the steps behind my venue and sobbed. But after that cathartic cry, things started to improve. I realised that having to adapt my act to fluctuations in audience size and sobriety was teaching me resilience, and that being at the bottom of the performing pile meant the only way was up.Glorious drunken nights followed, including furtive kisses round the back of the Gilded Balloon and many chip suppers. I wept at Waverley station when it was time to go back to Manchester – and I’ve been on the emotional rollercoaster that is the fringe ever since.Lucy Porter: Pass It On is at Pleasance Courtyard.I was doing street theatre with Jez Benstock but I can’t remember a single thing we did. Not a single joke, not even if we wore costumes. The only thing I can say for certain is that it was 1982 and we earned next to no money. I have a tiny, tiny memory of being stared at with a bit more confusion and aggression than Jez, because I wasn’t Scottish. That’s it. But it couldn’t have been that terrible as I’ve been back nearly 20 times.David Baddiel’s AniMalcolm is at the Gilded Balloon Teviot.I was MC for a London outfit called Screaming Blue Murder. They took comics up to Edinburgh every year for a package show so a bunch of us went up in 1995. The company put us all up. The only thing we had to do was flyer for three hours a day. That was my first experience of flyering and I wouldn’t like to go back. There’s nothing more disheartening than someone taking a flyer, looking at it, looking at your face, then uttering the words: “Are you funny?” Then you have 30 seconds to sell your show before watching them walk off down the Royal Mile, crumpling your flyer and throwing it to the ground.One year, I was performing at the Gilded Balloon and the entire building had a fire alarm. Like the pied piper, I led my audience out and continued the show standing on a crate. I spotted all the other comics who’d had to abandon their shows. So we just did an impromptu live gig there. Daniel Kitson, John Bishop – everyone did five minutes. That’s the spirit of the festival.The Stephen K Amos Talk Show is at the Gilded Balloon Teviot and out on Audible this month.My very first Edinburgh was in a sketch show in 1982. The next year I went up on my own doing standup, sandwiched between Arnold Brown and Norman Lovett. I used to psyche myself up in a cupboard all day just so I could get on stage and do my set about periods and masturbation, two words that apparently sounded very middle class when I said them – which could have been down to timing or because I was middle class. I didn’t win the Perrier award but I did develop a nasty strain of thrush due to drinking 10 lagers a night.Helen Lederer: I Might As Well Say It is at the Underbelly.Ken Campbell had written me a play. He called it an “x-rated one-woman ventriloquial farce”. I’d done two sold-out shows in London so I was excited. But in Edinburgh, all I can remember is four people and either Ken or my dad in the audience. I was scared of Ken because he was such a formidable intellect and had a fierce temper. I was trying to do my best doing all these voices and would tell him: “You’ve written something that is impossible, what can I do?” He’d say: “I’m not interested in anything less than you doing the impossible. That’s what I want!” Monkey, a puppet I still use, was in that show. Ken had made him be in love with me, which I found disgusting. I felt like I knew what Monkey should say. I did five minutes on my own with Monkey in Nicholas Parsons’ show and got laughs. So the next year I went back and did standup.Nina Conti is Monkey is at the Underbelly.I did a show in what was effectively a derelict building. It had seven venues spread over three floors, with hundreds of people coming in and out every hour, but not a single toilet and no running water. For the first few shows, I had no microphone so had to shout. I quickly lost my voice.The Birthday Girls, a sketch group, were performing in the “room” next door (ie on the other side of a black curtain). They had songs in their act and I had to rewrite my material so that the punchlines came during the quieter bits inbetween.I bought hundreds of party poppers for the audience to use to drown out the deafening noise from the Edinburgh Tattoo fireworks that went off at the same time every bloody night. So the show basically became a terrible and unintentional piece of performance art.Viv Groskop: Vivalicious is at the Underbelly.I was running a youth club and working for the BBC as a gag writer. One of the guys I was working with, Danny Robbins, invited me to do five minutes in character within his show. It was in a Portakabin in the Pleasance. Well, I say in the Pleasance – it was like walk through the Pleasance Courtyard where all the fun stuff is, keep walking, past the bins, behind the carpark and the train tracks. And just when you think the Pleasance is completely finished, it was there. People would never find it. The show was terribly promoted. We’d have eight or 10 people a night. Halfway through the run, I wrote a little rap and started promoting it myself around the courtyard.The festival is like New Year’s Eve every night. It’s very hard to be professional because there’s so much fun to be had. There was a lot of heavy drinking, late nights, a severe lack of sleep. And, because I was only doing five minutes a day, I felt no reason to be disciplined.Doc Brown stars in Cleaning Up, a new ITV drama with Sheridan Smith.There were seven of us in the show and we called ourselves Club Seals. I was doing standup in a double act and doing it solo as well. I ended up winning the BBC New Comedian award – because I was performing every night, twice, as a standup and I’d do other venues, too, like the Bearpit. I was match fit and loving it.We asked Newcastle Brown Ale to sponsor our show. They saidour name trivialised an atrocity. We thought that was terribly funny so got T-shirts saying: “Club Seals – trivialising an atrocity since 1996.”Marcus Brigstocke: Devil May Care is at the Pleasance Courtyard.I remember the smells of Edinburgh – hops, beer, baked potatoes. The tatty shop was just down the road from where we played. We lived on them. It was 1978, the end of my second year at Cambridge, and we were in a Footlights revue directed by Clive Anderson. There were six of us: four blokes and two women in a show called Stagefright. We all had to wear white jeans and white shirts with a different coloured tie, which was more flattering for the men than the women. Clive is very good at comedy and the rhythm of jokes. He’d written a lot of the show. I had a song which was like a parody of Tammy Wynette. I had a bright pink dress and a blonde wig. It was about Margaret Thatcher. I think it was really not very feminist looking back on it.I was in Edinburgh in 1998 for the So You Think You’re Funny competition. I remember talking to some people and seeing Rich Hall jog by in a hurry for his show. I thought to myself: “One day I’m going to be late for my own show.” I went in 2002 for a full month. When I first got there, I went to the Pleasance Courtyard. It was six in the evening. I saw all the people to-ing and fro-ing, saw the menu board of comedy shows and got really intimidated. I called my ex-girlfriend. We had just broken up and weren’t speaking. “I know you don’t like me,” I said, “but I’m scared.”Reginald D Hunter: An American Facing the Beast and Niggas is at the Pleasance at EICC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8beb51a251b5f88194134368823596aee6c5d576/0_247_5603_3362/master/5603.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656206f67e821d1daf55560411d4d711","title":"mr swallow and the vanishing elephant review edinburgh festival","story":"Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghNick Mohammed doesn’t quite conjure the powers of previous extravaganzas but this entertaining set has some impressive feats of memoryNick Mohammed’s comedy, magic and musical mashups have been among the highlights of recent Edinburgh fringes, culminating in a Houdini extravaganza two years ago that I’d happily have been chained to. His new show, The Vanishing Elephant, where he is again in character as excitable northern busybody Mr Swallow, doesn’t quite measure up. It’s more of a conventional magic show, without the preposterous narrative or musical overreach of its predecessors. I also missed erstwhile sidekicks Mr Goldsworth and Jonathan Mr Swallow is a character at his eccentric funniest when he has someone to play off.The conceit – it may even be true – is that Mr Swallow has narrowly failed to secure the elephant that would have supplied the show’s dramatic finale. Instead, he serves up some lesser illusions, a few impressive feats of memory – and character comedy too, if lower in the mix than usual. Sometimes the comedy and magic pull in different directions. In a subsidiary character as the scouse spirit-guide Claire, Mohammed pulls off a mean tarot card trick, but the alter ego is so garish – and the amplified voice so grating – the conjuring gets a bit overwhelmed.But if the show is not quite one thing or another, nor up to the dazzling standards Mohammed has set, it’s still entertaining and pleasingly theatrical. A levitating table is deployed to amusing effect elsewhere, for want of an assistant, Mr Swallow saws himself in half. Best of all are his marvels of arithmetic and “memorisation”, as audience volunteers test him on his recall of the Wagamama menu, then on the square root of their bill. One might wish the elephant hadn’t vanished before the show began – but this an enjoyable substitute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5dbcd6d43321bcbe1fb4fc7eb1b8d3e9820098/0_103_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b8e7fb07d0a1bb3eb1c2d6c0b86c4ff","title":"google location tracking android iphone mobile","story":"Some services on Android and iPhone automatically stores your movements even after you pause the ‘location history’ settingGoogle wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you\u0027ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.Computer science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP\u0027s request.For the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a “timeline” that maps out your daily movements.Storing your minute-by-minute travels carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects. So the company will let you “pause” a setting called “location history”.Google says that will prevent the company from remembering where you\u0027ve been. Google\u0027s support page on the subject states: “You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.”That isn\u0027t true. Even with “location history” paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, such as “chocolate chip cookies” or “kids science kits”, pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude accurate to the square foot and save it to your Google account.The privacy issue affects about 2 billion users of devices that run Google\u0027s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.Storing location data in violation of a user\u0027s preferences was wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission\u0027s enforcement bureau. A researcher from Mayer\u0027s lab confirmed the AP\u0027s findings on multiple Android devices the AP conducted its own tests on several iPhones that found the same behavior.“If you\u0027re going to allow users to turn off something called ‘location history’, then all the places where you maintain location history should be turned off, Mayer said. “That seems like a pretty straightforward position to have.”Google says it is being perfectly clear.“There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people\u0027s experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. “We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.”To stop Google from saving these location markers, the company says, users can turn off another setting, one that does not specifically reference location information. Called “web and app activity” and enabled by default, that setting stores a variety of information from Google apps and websites to your Google account.When paused, it will prevent activity on any device from being saved to your account. But leaving “web and app activity” on and turning “location history” off only prevents Google from adding your movements to the “timeline”, its visualization of your daily travels. It does not stop Google\u0027s collection of other location markers.You can delete these location markers by hand, but it\u0027s a painstaking process since you have to select them inidually, unless you want to delete all of your stored activity.You can see the stored location markers on a page in your Google account at myactivity.google, although they are typically scattered under several different headers, many of which are unrelated to location.Huge tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over their data practices, following a series of privacy scandals at Facebook and new data-privacy rules recently adopted by the European Union. Last year, the business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby cellphone towers even if all location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data anyway.Critics say Google\u0027s insistence on tracking its users\u0027 locations stems from its drive to boost advertising revenue.Google offers a more accurate description of how “location history” actually works in a place you would only see if you turn it off: a popup that appears when you “pause” Location History on your Google account webpage. There, the company notes that some location data may be saved as part of your activity on other Google services, like Search and Maps”.Google offers additional information in a popup that appears if you reactivate the “web and app activity” setting – an uncommon action for many users, since this setting is on by default. That popup states that, when active, the setting “saves the things you do on Google sites, apps, and services … and associated information, like location”.Since 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online ads at driving foot traffic, a feature that Google has said relies on user location histories.The company is pushing further into such location-aware tracking to drive ad revenue. At a Google Marketing Live summit in July, Google executives unveiled a new tool that uses ads to boost in-person store visits. It says it can measure how well a campaign drove foot traffic with data pulled from Google users\u0027 location histories.Google also says location records stored in My Activity are used to target ads. Ad buyers can target ads to specific locations, say, a mile radius around a particular landmark and typically have to pay more to reach this narrower audience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc2db4f1edd7de4cb52cc52971ffd4076e591a3f/0_267_3371_2023/master/3371.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e41171e9258e08ebb806a2c0fb6e0650","title":"chelsea manning to discuss cambridge analytica during london visit","story":"The whistleblower will speak in October at the Institute of Contemporary Arts dinnerChelsea Manning will discuss the Cambridge Analytica scandal and other issues around technology and democracy during her first appearance in the UK later this year.Manning was released from prison after being sentenced in 2013 in violation of the US Espionage Act for disclosing classified government documents to WikiLeaks. In October, she will be the main guest at the Institute of Contemporary Arts dinner, which is being held in her honour.The UK-based company, an offshoot of an American military contractor called SCL Group, offered electoral services to politicians across the world, including the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns in the US. Publicly, this included creating and buying digital advertising privately, according to claims made in secret filming by then-CEO Alexander Nix, it may have extended to honeytrap stings and other dark arts. (Nix now denies CA used such methods.)That depends on your definition of work. The company was listed as a partner on Leave.EU\u0027s application to become the official Brexit campaign, and carried out some preparatory studies. But both companies say no contract was ever signed, nor money paid, and that the exploratory work wasn\u0027t used in the eventual referendum campaign.While working on the Cruz campaign in the 2016 US election, Cambridge Analytica partnered with a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan, to explore psychographics, a marketing practice that involves psychologically profiling iniduals and tailoring adverts to their personalities. Kogan used an app tied in to Facebook to download data from 800,000 users – and around 70 million of their friends – and used that data as the basis of his psychographic model.Two-and-a-half years after\u0026nbspthe first report in the \u0026nbspof Kogan\u0027s use of Facebook data, the company responded, banning Kogan and Cambridge Analytica from its platform and launching an investigation into misuse of its site.The Information Commissioner announced an intention to levy a £500,000 fine, the maximum possible, against Facebook for two breaches of data protection laws.The whistleblower has been asked to talk about the rise of artificial intelligence, the state of the data economy and the role of algorithms in public policy. She will also talk about Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and harvested raw data from up to 87m Facebook profiles.Other issues that will be discussed by the former US army intelligence analyst include the Panama Papers, documents showing the myriad ways in which the rich can exploit secretive offshore tax regimes.Manning was invited to attend the event by Stefan Kalmár, who was appointed director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2016. He came to the ICA from Artists Space in New York and was described at the time by an art world insider as a “true innovator”.Talking about the decision to hold the dinner in Manning’s honour, he said: “I am very excited.”He explained that he had tried to reconnect the ICA to its original funding mission. “It was always a social, political radical engaged organisation. It was also always outspoken,” he said. “The underlining agenda was always that we connect culture production to social and political meaning and, I hope, show that the power of an inidual can change the world through bravery, courage, determination and vision. We could not be happier to welcome Chelsea to London.”Kalmár said Manning wanted to talk about empowerment of commercial software used in warfare and artificial intelligence.Since her release from prison, Manning has said pressures and difficulties with mainstream outlets had forced her to send the documents directly to WikiLeaks but she has never apologised or expressed regret.Manning said her time in prison had “a lot of long-term effects” on her but that she did not fully understand them. “It’s been slow.

Well, actually, it wasn’t. She was just a Vision 3 SL cruiser with three cabins and a kitchen. But as soon as we leapt aboard and ran around her top deck like excited children, we couldn’t help but think of Duran Duran’s cheesy 1980s video. So Rio she became.We were in Languedoc in France to explore the Petite Camargue the expanse of Rhone delta wetlands which lie to the west of the Camargue, across the regional border in Provence. It’s a landscape of marshes, lagoons, salt pans and phenomenal birdlife – perfect for a boating holiday.For five days, the four of us planned to pootle along the Canal du Rhône à Sète, mooring where and when we liked. We didn’t even need any boating experience – a quick training session at Le Boat’s boatyard in Saint Gilles and we were off.Our first night’s destination wasn’t particularly ambitious – just 15km west to tiny Gallician. The afternoon light was turning golden as we settled into life at Rio’s soothing pace – no more than 8km an hour.Time seemed to slow down. White Camargue horses looked at us from the towpath. Herons sauntered by, stretching their long legs. We had time to gaze at the wildlife, even spotting white flamingos at the water’s edge. As the light faded, frogs and crickets started their dusk chorus and fish jumped from the water. Rather than pay mooring fees at Gallician, we stopped just before, pounding stakes into the grassy bank to secure Rio for the night, and sat on deck to watch the sun go down and feast on cheeses, saucisson, pâté, tomatoes, olives and fresh bread, accompanied by vin gris, the gorgeously dry pale rosé of the Camargue. No one else was around to disturb our peace.After too much wine,we couldn’t resist a late-night stroll along the bank, listening to the faint sounds of cowbells and frogs. Even the mosquitoes didn’t entirely destroy the atmosphere. Sleep came easily in the comfortable cabins, which were just the right side of cosy. In the morning, we chugged along to medieval Aigues-Mortes with egrets, grebes and herons for company.After such a bucolic journey, Aigues-Mortes appeared big and busy. It’s not really, but its 8,000-strong population was in the midst of its annual festival, and busy carousing within the town’s medieval walls. The 13th-century Tour de Constance was the starting point for a walk along the medieval ramparts, where we could peek into the town’s trim gardens, terraces and cobbled lanes, as well as the cafe-filled Place Saint-Louis. From high up on the fortifications, we had a perfect view of the Petite Camargue. Seemingly endless pink salt marshes spread out as far as I could see as, with picturesque timing, a trio of Camargue cowboys ambled into town on their white horses to join the festivities.Aigues-Mortes’ Sunday food market gave us the chance to stock up on Languedoc goodies including bull saucisson, more vin gris and creamy goat’s cheeses. The market is a lively affair, with dozens of stalls under the plane trees outside the ramparts,and the smell of roasting rotisserie chickens filling the air.Back on the boat, as we continued west to our next, as yet undecided stop, we discovered why the skies were so wonderfully blue: a strong wind blowing along the canal was keeping any rain at bay. On a calmer day, we could have stopped at Carnon-Plage or Palavas-les-Flots, two summer seaside resorts. Instead, we battled on to moor at an empty spot just beyond Palavas-les-Flots, where we devoured our market produce.Our final stop was Maguelone, about 3km west, where we crossed a pontoon bridge to a little isthmus and visited the half-ruined medieval cathedral. Walking trails snaked between the marshes and lagoons, filled with people enjoying the sunny Sunday afternoon. We headed to the sandy beach at Pilou, where kitesurfers swooped along the water in a fantastic show of acrobatics.Back on the boat, we watched the sun dip below the horizon, while flamingos flew overhead, looking like snakes with wings. It was my birthday, and that of my oldest friend, who had travelled here from Toronto. The last time we celebrated our birthdays together was on a Camden pub crawl in 1989. Now we were knocking back rosé and eating grilled goats’ cheese salad on a boat on a Languedoc canal. Being middle-aged can be a good thing at times.Mercifully, the wind had died down by the time we turned back east the following day, and we eased our craft back down the canal in glorious sunshine. After docking in Saint-Gilles, we flopped in the sun on Rio’s top deck. When evening fell in this sheltered spot, we had our final alfresco dinner.My initial worries had come to nothing. We didn’t fall out. We didn’t fall in. But I did fall in love – with life on the water.• Boat hire and flights to Nîmes were proviced by Le Boat, which has a five-night Camargue short break on a Vision 3 SL, which sleeps up to 10, from £1,300.

Now his superfan is on a mission to resurrect his reputation in this fascinating BBC Four documentaryMark was a teenager when he first saw Johnny across a room. He was immediately struck by him, mesmerised even, by Johnny’s long face, his wide eyes, their look of melancholy. It was the start of an obsession that has continued throughout Mark’s life.Mark is Mark Gatiss – actor, writer, Whovian, Holmesian, Renaissance polymath. Johnny is the painter John Minton. Who? Well, that’s kind of the point. At one time, Minton was more famous than his contemporaries Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud – now he is largely forgotten. Gatiss wants the world to unforget, to show how Minton is still important and to celebrate his work. “It’s time to invite Johnny back to the party that he left all too soon,” he says.Minton killed himself in 1957, aged 39. The room Mark first saw him across was in the National Portrait Gallery he was looking at – and falling for – Johnny’s self-portrait. He follows in Minton’s footsteps and stalks him to Soho, where Gatiss too gravitated on coming to London, “naturally – or unnaturally, because of its reputation for decadence, naughtiness”. They would probably have known each other if Gatiss had arrived in Soho half a century earlier.He meets some of the people who knew Minton, people who were part of the same bohemian scene – artists, students, muses and sitters. They include Bridget Riley and Peter Blake, and a former bodybuilder named Spencer Churchill, who turns out to be the subject of the Minton sketch that Gatiss owns. I suppose that’s one good thing about Minton being largely forgotten: you don’t have to be an oligarch or an oil sheikh to get your hands on one.Gatiss drifts down to what were London’s docks, where – in the blitzed wartime wasteland – Minton found romanticism. He pursues him to Cornwall, where Minton escaped from the heady excess of the capital to find new colour. Also to Corsica, although sadly not to Jamaica (a BBC Four budget doesn’t stretch that far, apparently.) And he examines the illustrations that made Minton so sought-after and celebrated, such as the ones on Elizabeth David’s cookbooks. I remember one my mum had: French Country Cooking, I think. Maybe you too knew Minton, without knowing that you did.But as much as it is about celebrating the work and looking at the pictures, it is about the man behind them. Gatiss plunges headlong into his hero’s world. In Minton’s Notting Hill studio, he imagines how it might have been – Dylan Thomas passed out in an armchair, Freud sneaking in with a pretty model, Johnny himself dancing a highland jig over a pair of crossed umbrellas.Listening to a recording of Minton – crackly and clipped – is, for Gatiss, like “reaching back into the past and holding his hand”. Which, given a Tardis, is surely what he would do. In Corsica, there pretty much is a Tardis. Or at least a monochrome bus, which Gatiss is suddenly riding through the hills in 1947. Every time it stops, he hops off with his sketchbook, as Minton did, to capture a view (is there no end to this man’s talents?). He has actually become Minton.In his haunting, waif-like self-portraits, Gatiss detects something else going on, “a familiar longing, a sort of ache”. In a deeply repressive age, Minton’s sexual awakening came about in the wartime blackout with sailors down by the docks. He became an early champion of gay rights, splendidly taking on Marie Stopes on the letters page of the Listener in 1950, 17 years before the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in England and Wales.Gatiss speaks so well about Minton’s work, his struggles between modernism and conservatism, the commercial and the artistic, and how he eventually fell out of favour. Gatiss speaks not as an art historian but as an informed superfan, one who truly gets him. It is this identification with the subject that makes this more than an informed documentary about an artist you (OK, I) have never heard of. It is a personal, poignant, melancholy portrait, with moments of optimism and joy. A bit like that picture of – and by – Johnny that Mark first fell in love with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b5a6b7b69e56a9fe39f75fcb06308fe7d653f8c/129_17_1019_611/master/1019.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42b13539e49445f2a185c810a637ad53","title":"dan walker mug gate bbc answer piers morgan","story":"The mild-mannered presenter has become testy on Twitter of late: this could be the tonic the Beeb’s breakfast show needsEver since Piers Morgan took control of Good Morning Britain, breakfast television has changed. Once it was simply a place where two very patient, mild-mannered anchors could repeat the same four news stories every half an hour until you went to work.But Piers has upset the order. Because now breakfast television is largely a receptacle for berkish blokes who want to belch and groan their own dumb opinions at length regardless of the situation. Forget news, it’s gaffes that people want. It’s post-show virality. That’s why, when Piers Morgan has a day off, Good Morning Britain brings in Richard Madeley. And it’s why, if Piers Morgan and Richard Madeley both have a day off at the same time, Good Morning Britain will hire a chimp, or a dog in a hat, or a Teddy Ruxpin loaded up with an Anthrax cassette to take their place.Compared to the bonk-headed pyrotechnics on ITV, BBC Breakfast has always been relatively sedate. But that also might be about to change. Because, and this is hugely exciting to report, Dan Walker has just stepped up. If everything goes according to plan, Walker might just emerge as the new breakfast villain of our time.On and on and on it went. But most people know to never engage with this sort of online buffoonery, because you can never win an argument with an idiot. Walker, though, lost his damn mind. Five hours later, he clapped back with a furiously itemised list of all his mug-based grievances. “1. It’s a mug 2. It’s LICENCE 3. They cost about £1.50 each 4. That’s a grand total of £3 for the 2 we use every day 5. Did I mention it’s a mug? 6. I hope you’re not doing anything ‘frivolous’ like drinking tea today 7. Thanks for watching.”If this seems familiar, it’s because it’s almost exactly what happened during the World Cup, when he posted a video of a bear in a football shirt putting balls in a barrel. “I think he might be an #England fan,” Walker quipped, to the widespread horror of hundreds of people who saw the clip as Walker condoning animal cruelty. Walker’s reaction, again, was to wig out. “Please listen. I do NOT think this is cool, funny or clever. I do think it’s VILE. I do not think it should be ignored. I felt – perhaps foolishly – that it would be obvious I thought it was disgusting but I can see the reason for confusion from the tone,” he sniffed, before confusing the tone further by using the hashtag #SaveTheBear and a thumbs up emoji.To be clear, I am all for Walker’s behaviour. BBC Breakfast still routinely gets more viewers than Good Morning Britain, but it lacks a breakout star. This might just be Walker’s opportunity to shine. Until now he’s just been a mildly anaemic, Tim Lovejoyish bloke-lite of a presenter. But by revealing his short fuse, he’s finally given the producers something to exploit. It is my honest opinion that all breakfast TV producers want is a clip that will blow up once the show has ended, like when Madeley shouted at Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, or whenever you see Susanna Reid sadly reassess all her life decisions midway through the 10th Piers Morgan rant of the day. And Walker is the man who’ll provide this for the BBC.BBC Breakfast, please lean into this. If you have any sense, you’ll spend every episode gently goading Walker. Mess with his autocue a little. Make him interview 20 crying toddlers at once. Fill his mug with bees. Anything, so long as it makes him lose his temper on air, because then we’ll all spend a day laughing about it on Twitter, and he’ll become a star and you’ll reinforce your ratings superiority. Dan Walker is quite clearly a gaffe king in waiting. Perhaps it’s time for a coronation.

Now, after a week of waning quakes, residents are holding their breath, waiting to see if this, finally, could signal the end of the eruption that has crippled the easternmost part of the island.Volcano, a tiny tourist town nestled in a high elevation forest, is a scant five miles from the caldera of Kilauea volcano. Its location makes it especially vulnerable to earthquakes, which during July sometimes numbered as high as 800 a day, according to Kyle Anderson, a seismologist with US Geological Survey.Ferns and Ohia trees line the streets of Volcano’s main road, punctuated by several restaurants, a general store and a post office. There is a skate park, a winery and an art center nearby. Under normal circumstances the village experiences only occasional earthquakes, residents said, but in the months since Kilauea began erupting, a “big one” hit “like clockwork” every day for months. Most of those larger quakes ranged between a 3.0 and a 5.0 magnitude, forcing everyone to grab whatever was nearby and brace themselves until the shaking stopped.“I’ve heard from some people that they are getting a little traumatized,” said Adam Laning, the manager at Hawaii True Value Hardware store in Volcano. Early on, Laning said, he learned that certain items – motor oil, dish soap, six-packs – needed to be secured on shelves or the shaking would tip them to the ground.Typically the daytime population of Volcano is about half local residents, half visitors on their way to and from Hawaii Volcanoes national park, Laning said. But these are not normal circumstances. The park is closed until further notice and tourism is way down.“It’s turned this town into a ghost town,” Kathy Tripp, a 35-year Volcano resident, said of the earthquakes.Many of the last months’ daily quakes hovered around a 2.0 magnitude or less. On a particularly active day, the more sensitive people in town felt dozens of them. Many residents said that as the days wore on, they began to distinguish between different types of shakes. Some came in waves, others felt like quick vibrations. It became a kind of secret language, prompting people in town to speculate about what activity was happening inside the volcano.It was the kind of thing Tripp just couldn’t get used to. “Even after months, they still get you by surprise,” she said. “The constant shaking is like nothing you could have ever expected.” At some points, Tripp said, she even witnessed the pavement undulating beneath her.“If I was in the car in the parking lot I would see the cars going up and down – the whole lot was moving,” she said.Sometimes the big ones came in the daylight, and other times they came at night. Mishi Simmons Clauberg, a Volcano resident, said that in recent weeks she’d been woken up at 4am to her chandelier swaying, her bed shaking and moving across the floor. “We have come up with the motto, ‘rock, roll and repeat,’ she said.Most people said they learned to adjust after a few days of quakes, and that the majority of homes have held up well. At Volcano Winery, the only casualties of the earthquakes were two wine glasses, precariously placed. But employees there knew the earth was moving when the wine began sloshing in the vats.“It has become the new normal for us,” said Lani Delapenia, the winery manager. “For some visitors, it’s their first time experiencing an earthquake. It’s exciting for lots of them and scary for some.”While the Puna region has been ravaged by lava, Volcano residents have been living in a strange limbo: almost on top of the volcanic epicenter, but removed from the worst of the physical destruction of recent months. The village remained untouched as many residents downhill watched molten rock consume their homes. Even fumes such as vog (volcanic fog) and laze (volcanic haze, produced when lava meets sea water) are infrequent, considering its location. Residents like to brag that as long as the trade winds are blowing, their air stays clear.“On a sunny day, there is no place like it,” Tripp said. She isn’t the first one to feel that way. In 1909 volcanologist Thomas A Jaggar arrived en route for research in Japan. But during the layover he decided to stay in Volcano and study its unique explosive phenomena, establishing the United States’ first volcano observatory.The story of Jaggar is one that Suzi Bond knows well. As a community theater producer and director, she helps put on a weekly one-man show about the volcanologist and the history of the area. Bond has been producing theater in Volcano for 25 years. But the Jagger show has been on hold since Kilauea began erupting, and two community theater venues have been forced to close. The main theater’s production of Oliver! became an orphan, with its 21 local actors having to rehearse in dance studios, living rooms and the local Lutheran church.Bond, who lives outside town, says that unlike most people, she doesn’t feel the quakes. “It’s my superpower,” she said. If given the choice, she would have preferred to continue performing in the 1934 theater she knows so well, despite its proximity to the caldera, which has collapsed dramatically since the beginning of the eruptions.“The overhead lights do sway when there’s an earthquake,” she said. But like many in Volcano, she takes a practical approach. “I originally proposed that we just shouldn’t seat anyone in the first four or five rows.”After days with few big quakes – the largest this week so far was a 4.4 magnitude on Thursday, and the total daily number now dropped down into the teens – Bond and others say they’re counting the days, hoping that this, perhaps, could signal an end to the eruption chaos.“It feels great that the quakes have begun to stop, but we are still left with a destination village without a destination,” Tripp said. But, she added, she and others have stayed this long for a reason. In more normal times, she’s often gone to view the glow of the volcano beneath a starry sky that’s among the brightest in the hemisphere. Recalling the memory helps remind her that for most of the time she’s lived here, Volcano has been a place of peace and natural beauty.“This is the only home we know. And we’re going to make it through because we don’t want to go anywhere else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f7f0d76093687fcd0dfe9cc1f4aec5a929d7859/0_61_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb1df78c32de3e4a979927cbe5051569","title":"hong kong activist andy chan decries china colonial invasion defiant speech","story":"Andy Chan makes speech to foreign journalists in defiance of Chinese governmentA Hong Kong pro-independence activist has decried Beijing’s rule over the city as modern-day colonialism in a speech to a foreign journalists’ association that defied China’s demand that the event be cancelled.Beijing swiftly criticised the talk, saying freedom of speech in Hong Kong did not extend to discussion of independence, which it said was a threat to national security. “We express our indignation and condemn it,” the Chinese foreign ministry office in Hong Kong said.The government’s demand raised questions about Beijing’s growing influence in the former British colony, which was promised semi-autonomy and freedom of speech as part of the 1997 handover. Xi Jinping, China’s president, and other officials have warned separatist activity will not be tolerated.Small groups of pro-Beijing and pro-democracy protesters gathered outside the Foreign Correspondents’ Club building in Hong Kong before and during the speech by Andy Chan of the Hong Kong National party. Some pro-Beijing protesters carried banners saying “Hong Kong independence is poisonous”.Current and former Hong Kong leaders have criticised the FCC for hosting Chan, whose party is facing a possible ban on national security grounds.Chan told the FCC audience: “Sadly, we are a nation that is quickly being annexed and destroyed by China. The cry for Hong Kong independence is therefore a cry against colonial invasion.”The Chinese government criticised the FCC for hosting Chan, comparing Hong Kong’s pro-independence advocates to Nazis in Germany and terrorists in the US. It said governments had the right to restrict expression of ideas that threatened social order.“No country will allow foreign institutions to invite separatist forces on their own land to advocate splitting the country and inciting violent resistance,” the statement said. During his talk, Chan said he condemned violence in political action.The 75-year-old FCC has previously hosted politicians and newsmakers, including pro-Beijing speakers, at its clubhouse in central Hong Kong. The club says it believes its members and the public have the right “to hear the views of different sides in any debate”.The perception that Beijing is reneging on its promise of semi-autonomy, and eroding Hong Kong’s free elections and freedom of speech, is helping nurture a generation of young activists calling for greater autonomy, if not outright independence.Huge pro-democracy protests erupted in 2014 in response to the decision by China’s ruling Communist party to retain the right to effectively pre-screen candidates for Hong Kong’s leadership.Hong Kong officials have dismissed the FCC’s argument that Chan’s appearance amounts to a free speech matter, with the territory’s former chief executive Leung Chun-ying equating the club staging the event with giving a platform to “criminals and terrorists”.The current Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, told reporters on Sunday it was “inappropriate” for the FCC to host Chan and asked the organisation to respect that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f48a842f1597dd9d640dd745e69b57cbf30c08e/0_202_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=745cc1f6841dc0aed8a623c7697f1667","title":"new zealand to consider miscarriage leave for parents in bid to tackle taboo subject","story":"Women and their partners could be entitled to three days of paid bereavement leave after a miscarriage or stillbirthA bill legislating three days’ paid bereavement leave for women and their partners after a miscarriage will be considered by New Zealand’s parliament.The Labour MP Ginny Andersen, who sponsored the bill, said miscarriage was still a “taboo subject” in New Zealand and paid leave to grieve for the loss of a baby – at any stage of the pregnancy – would bring the subject into the open. The proposed bill also covers stillbirths.At present, New Zealanders are entitled to bereavement leave after the loss of a family member or child but that does not include the loss of a child who is not born alive.The ministry of health describes miscarriages as “fairly common” and says one or two out of every 10 pregnant women will miscarry a baby.“The lack of clarity has meant some women have been in the position of having to argue with their employer about whether they are entitled to leave because they have lost their unborn child,” said Andersen.“A lot of women have had more than one miscarriage and it can be very traumatic and difficult if you are trying to hold down a job.”Andersen said anyone who had a “confirmed pregnancy” would be entitled to the leave, but there would likely need to be some discussion over how a pregnancy would be confirmed. Once it was confirmed, a miscarriage at any stage of the pregnancy would be eligible for the bereavement leave.Iain Lees-Galloway, the minister for workplace relations and safety, said he would support the bill and that it reflected the government’s “compassionate, people-centred and progressive approach” to politics.“A miscarriage is a terrible time for parents and this bill provides certainty for parents and employers around the definition of a miscarriage so that parents can grieve and spend time to work through the personal toll of a miscarriage,” said Lees-Galloways.Kathryn van Beek, who approached several MPs to sponsor the bill, had a miscarriage two years ago. Afterwards she discovered many New Zealand women had struggled to get time off to grieve and process their loss.“Not everyone who miscarries will experience grief and feel as though they need to access bereavement leave, but for those who do it is important they have the option and it is legislated,” she said.Andersen said she expected cross-party support from NZ First and the Greens for her bill, and had also had warm and positive responses from a number of opposition National MPs. “A lot of people are saying this is a very sensible idea, and we want to take the politics out of this one and have the whole house support it.”Some other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman gives birth to a stillborn baby.

The protesters had two main complaints: rising taxes and the fact that, in recent years, some of the world’s most powerful armies had descended on their country.But before the civil society leaders could even get to the march, they were arrested.When a group of heavily armed men on motorbikes killed four American special ops soldiers in remote Niger last October, it was the first many had heard of the war the US was helping fight against a local branch of Isis.But their involvement in that fight represents only a fraction of the US presence in the west African country, poor but strategically located in the middle of the Sahel, its borders crisscrossed by extremists and traffickers.And the 800 US defence personnel in Niger are not alone. They are one of four western armies that have installed themselves in the vast desert landscape, variously flying armed drones, hunting militants, building vast bases, controlling migration and collecting intelligence from the region.This is what the April protest was about.Ibrahim Diori was arrested at home, and Maïkou Zodi in his car, both charged with participation in a banned demonstration and destruction of public property, even though they were not present. Today, they are in jail awaiting trial, along with colleagues arrested over previous marches.The Nigerien government allows foreign powers free rein to build military bases and send soldiers to defend their interests in the region, while suppressing any dissent, according to those civil society leaders not in jail, and key opposition figures.“Today there’s terrible repression of those who are against the government line. They put seven of my colleagues in prison because we said no to foreign bases,” said Mariama Bayard, leader of the opposition. She said that the government was “illegitimate” because the main challenger, Hama Amadou, was in jail at the time of the last election, and that it was being propped up by foreigners in the absence of domestic support.“Dictatorship is taking hold of this country. The people don’t want the bases. But the Sahel has become an important geo-strategic space for the great powers,” she said.According to Bayard, foreign powers do not have permission to build bases in their country.“Our constitution says that before a base can be installed, parliament has to accept it. It’s a deal between the government and these foreign powers. It’s illegal, the bases are illegal.”With Boko Haram in the south-east, Isis-linked ISGS on the Malian border, and a chaotic Libya to the north, Niger is surrounded by violent extremists.As part of its counter-terrorism mission Operation Barkhane, France has 500 soldiers on its base in Niamey, and more on its bases in Madama and Aguelal. Germany has 50 soldiers in Niamey to support the UN peacekeeping force in Mali, and is expanding accommodation to cater for more on the airbase it shares with France. Canadian soldiers come and go.Italy has an advance team of 40 soldiers in the country, preparing for the arrival of up to 430 more troops who will “train, advise and assist” local forces to fight illicit trafficking, mostly of migrants. Many of the 640,000 refugees who have arrived in Italy since 2014 came through Niger.But it is the US, with its armed drones targeting militants including al-Qaeda leaders in Libya, that has attracted the most attention.The three giant white hangars of Airbase 201, the new US base near the centuries-old city of Agadez, which is costing $100m  (£78m) to build, stand on a long stretch of sand that is prone to puddles  local herders used to take their goats to drink there in rainy season.Some of these herders, living a few hundred metres away from the base’s new fences, said they had never met their new neighbours, though they often saw them whizzing past in air-conditioned SUVs, or by night, the shadow of their aircraft crossing the moon.“They don’t help us. I’ve always been poor, and I’m still poor,” said Sedefiou Abdou, who had never heard of America until the base came to his neighbourhood. References to Obama, Trump and Coca Cola drew a blank. Then he was played a snippet of a French cover of the wildly popular Latin hit Despacito, and his face finally lit up in recognition. Apart from the airbase, this was the closest America came to penetrating into his corner of the Sahel.Abdou had no more need of this knowledge than most Americans do for Niger’s rich and complex culture the two countries are thousands of miles apart. But his government and theirs were firm friends, as the Nigerien president said in an interview at his palace in Niamey, where former presidents deposed in Niger’s many coups gaze down from their portraits on the building’s high white arches.“I don’t like the term ‘foreign forces’ – they’re friendly forces, who will leave as soon as we want them to,” said Mahamadou Issoufou. “They’re here at our request, and once the need for them disappears, they’ll leave.”Issoufou recognised that they were also looking after their own interests, however.“They’re not just here for us. They do it for themselves. The countries who have sent their armies know that once the Sahel is conquered, the threat will concern them, will concern Europe. It’s a way of preventing that threat from spreading into their territory.”Civil society leaders and rights groups say protests against this and any controversial government policies have been “almost systematically denied”, while pro-government marches are allowed. Detained civil society leaders have been spread out in jails across the country.According to Boulama Hamadou Tcherno, one of the few civil society leaders who was not arrested in the March and April crackdowns, there has been silence from the nations in a position to put pressure on the government.“We’re very worried about what will happen in the next few years. Freedom to demonstrate, freedom of religion – even praying to God is forbidden. And all the big democratic powers turn their gaze away.” put the allegations that America is in effect propping up an illegitimate and repressive government to Thomas Waldhauser, the head of US Africa Command, in an interview at a small American base in Senegal last week.He emphasised that there had been “a lot of aid and security force assistance” in recent years and said that was why the US was there, as well as to help the country maintain its borders.Speaking more generally about the US presence in Africa, he said US troops were trying to “prevent something from spreading and happening before it actually does”.According to opponents of the foreign bases, however, they do not stop terrorists but attract them.“We see no results from their presence on the ground in fact we have the impression that terrorism has increased since they arrived. Are they really here to help our soldiers?” Tcherno asked.Bayard agreed. “They are creating the conditions for the Sahel to blow up,” she said. “They say that the bases are here for our security, but the opposite is true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d73968c596b503fa8997c8c8bb7b7ee9edff0b/0_265_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c7971809800959c05e488456b85e3cf","title":"what god has not joined together the rise of the humanist wedding","story":"Secular marriages are now the most popular in Scotland, prompting fresh calls for reform in England and WalesRobyn Hewatt and Andrew Downie were married with all the trappings of a traditional Scottish wedding: Hewatt’s father walked her down the aisle she had maids of honour and Downie had a best man. A piper played at the door.But there was no priest, minister or registrar to lead the ceremony. Like thousands of Scots, Hewatt and Downie were legally married by a humanist celebrant. For the first time last year, in what was once a famously religious country, the Humanist Society of Scotland married more people than the Church of Scotland.Hewatt, 29, a gym instructor, and Downie, 34, a manager with the Screwfix chain, said their wedding on Saturday fitted their identity. “We felt we could make it more personal to us and our story. A humanist ceremony spoke more to us than a more traditional religious type of ceremony,” Downie said.The catalyst for this dramatic shift came in 2005 when the then registrar general of Scotland changed the law on human rights grounds to allow humanist celebrants to conduct weddings. Scotland categorises humanist weddings as a non-religious belief ceremony, with the same legal status as church-based and civil marriages. Humanists include atheists and agnostics, and those who say they are spiritual but who dislike organised religion. They embrace same-sex marriage, too, unlike most mainstream churches.And since 2005 they have mushroomed: in 2017, there were 5,912 humanist weddings with 3,283 conducted by Humanist Society celebrants compared with just 3,166 by the Church of Scotland. With couples barred from legally marrying with a humanist wedding in England and Wales, some now travel to Scotland to be married, and at least four humanist celebrants from England are hoping for approval to carry out legal marriages in Scotland.Hewatt and Downie were married by Caroline Lambie, 47, who was brought up in the Scottish Episcopalian church, a branch of Anglicanism, before deciding at an early age she was agnostic. Lambie was herself married at a humanist wedding in 2007.“Being secular makes sense for most couples I work with,” she said. “These couples say to me that they would feel hypocritical if they did have a church wedding as they have no religious beliefs.”Prof Callum Brown, a historian at the University of Glasgow and an expert in secularism, believes the country has the highest rate globally of humanist weddings. “Scotland is leading the world in non-religious belief weddings,” Brown said. “I know of no other country where it is anywhere near so high.”This summer humanist weddings were legally recognised for the first time in Jersey and in Northern Ireland – a place still dominated by religious faith, heaping further pressure on ministers in London to finally authorise humanist weddings in England and Wales.Humanists UK, the body which covers England and Wales, is planning to take the UK government to court on human rights grounds in an effort to force reform. Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, said: “The continual failure to recognise humanist marriages in England and Wales not only makes these jurisdictions seem antiquated compared to the rest of the country, but fails to uphold the principle of equality embedded in our human rights settlement.”Brown said the decline in religious weddings and church attendance generally could be seen across Europe and the industrialised west, especially among whites. It was fuelled first by the advancement of women’s rights in the 1960s, which increased women’s education and economic independence.More couples chose to cohabit, never marrying or doing so later in life, he said. Progressively fewer people attend church and fewer still have their children baptised. He added Scotland had a long tradition of Sunday opening for shops, something liberalised in England and Wales only relatively recently.Brown saidthe rate of decline in religious involvement in Scotland had been far faster and more pronounced than in other parts of the UK. It had experienced “a dramatic change from the closed-mind Presbyterianism” which once dominated Scottish life, he said.Churches are privately critical of the humanist trend, suggesting it is a pick-and-mix form of consumerism, sometimes using Christian iconography such as crosses even though humanist events are intended to be secular.Yet Rev Dr George Whyte, the principal clerk at the Church of Scotland, said his church had failed to market its increasingly liberal approach to weddings. The Church of England, by contrast, has a slick and cheery website devoted to selling its religious marriages: yourchurchwedding.org.Whyte pointed out that couples no longer needed to be members of the church vows could be personalised and marriages conducted outside the church. There are no longer rules stipulating brides needed to enter first or be given away by their father."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3595180.1534226239!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vaping may not be as safe as previously thought study finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResearchers concluded that the vaping process itself increases the damage caused by the e-cigarette fluid. Photograph: Rolex Dela PenaEPA E-cigarette vapour destroys protective cells which keep the lungs clear of harmful particles, according to a new study published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ).According to the small, laboratory-based study, vapour from e-cigarettes impairs the activity of human lung cells called macrophages which are responsible for removing dust, bacteria and allergens. Some of the damage mirrors that seen in regular smokers and people with chronic lung disease, according to the study which appeared in the BMJ specialist journal Thorax.Using e-cigarettes, a practice commonly known as vaping, has become increasingly popular in Ireland in recent years both among tobacco smokers trying to kick the habit and young people who have never smoked cigarettes.Ireland is the third-biggest spender on e-cigarette products per capita (€14.40 in 2017) according to a Euromonitor International report. Only British and Japanese people spend more.Although it is generally accepted that e-cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco, there have been several recent studies that call into the question the view they are completely safe. The latest BMJ study is significant as it focuses on the effects of e-cigarette vapour on the lungs rather than on the composition of the e-cigarette fluid.It found the damage to lung cells caused by vapour was significantly more harmful than that caused by the fluid. Furthermore these effects worsened as the dose increased.The vapour increased cell death by a factor of 50 and significantly increased the production of inflammatory chemicals. The effect was even worse when the vapour contained nicotine, as most e-cigarette do.The researchers concluded that the vaping process itself increases the damage caused by the e-cigarette fluid. The study’s lead author Prof David Thickett said e-cigarettes are safer than normal cigarettes but that research into the area is “in its infancy” and it may be the case that they are harmful in the long term.“In terms of cancer causing molecules in cigarette smoke, as opposed to cigarette vapour, there are certainly reduced numbers of carcinogens. They are safer in terms of cancer risk, but if you vape for 20 or 30 years and this can cause COPD, then that’s something we need to know about,” he states.“I don’t believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than ordinary cigarettes,” Prof Thickett said. “But we should have a cautious scepticism that they are as safe as we are being led to believe.”He added that many e-cigarette companies have been bought by large tobacco firms “and there’s certainly an agenda to portray e-cigarettes as safe”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoIs there anyone left who remembers me,\u0026rsquo said letter in Clare ChampionResults will be available from schools and online by Wednesday morningTwo adults and three teenagers brought ashore at Skerries in early hoursVictorian redbrick facade of prominent Dublin city centre property to be retainedAgencies co-ordinate to facilitate largest outdoor event in Europe this yearSpending on organisation and security ided between church and StateQuestions raised about similarities between RDS women\u0026rsquos symposium and Rome eventFreedom of Information documents reveal level of hostility to repealing the amendmentWarning comes after outbreaks of infection in neonatal intensive care unitEffects similar to those seen in smokers and lung disease suffersPressure on Brendan Howlin as Martina Genockey says it would help party rebuildOverall number of people who walk to work nationally continues to fallAll electricity at its stores and distribution centres is now green electricityIrish Cancer Society warns public may be missing early diagnosis by not visiting GP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3595142.1534235883!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"organising the papal mass 4 000 communion servers 1 000 medics","story":"The Pope\u0027s visit to Ireland at the World Meeting of Families took over two years to plan and will include over 10,000 volunteers.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillWhile organising the largest outdoor event in Europe this year has been difficult from almost every angle and has required multiple arms of the State, including the Garda, the health services, the transport network, local authorities and the Office of Public Works (OPW), to operate seamlessly, the thing that has been playing on event co-ordinator Fr Damian McNeice’s mind most recently is Holy Communion.Specifically he has been working out how to make sure everyone who wants communion during the papal Mass in the Phoenix Park on August 26th gets it and it has been no easy task.“We will have half a million people looking for communion at the same time and my aim is to ensure we get it to them within a 15 to 20-minute window,” he says. “I don’t think they managed to reach everyone the last time a pope was in the park but we’re hopeful we will.”He has recruited 4,000 servers for the Mass, at which Pope Francis will be the chief celebrant. They will be stationed at the main altar under the shadow of the papal cross and at 16 sub-chapels where subsets of servers will have responsibility for several “corrals” each containing just over 1,000 of the faithful.As master of ceremonies for the event, communion is not the only thing of which he has oversight. He has had a hand in everything from the building of the altar to the 3,000-strong choir to the positioning of giant video screens and the creation of an app for event attendees.But even Fr McNeice accepts he is a small cog in an enormous machine, one that only really started to crank up in March.Transport has proved most taxing and getting people – many in their 70s and beyond – to and from the Phoenix Park is a challenge.“This is the largest event Ireland has organised in nearly 40 years,” Garda superintendent Thomas Murphy says. “It simply will not be possible to accommodate all the people who have indicated they want to travel by car. Therefore we are urging people to go by train, bus, coach or Luas.”By any measure, the walking and waiting will be considerable.The World Meeting of Families says attendees should allow at least eight hours for the event. There will be a 75-minute walk from half a dozen transport hubs around the park to its gates, a further 60 minutes to queue at those gates and another 60 minutes to walk to corrals marked on all attendee tickets.People should allow 30 minutes for the popemobile to pass, while the Mass is expected to last 105 minutes. The long march back to the transport hubs gate will take more than two hours and further long queues are likely.It is not, by any measure, for the faint of heart, which is why there will be more than 1,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics stationed at 1.5km intervals on all routes and designated rest zones as well as food and drinks stations, toilets and baby changing facilities are all in place.And, as some somewhat alarmist headlines have made clear, there will be an on-site mortuary, although its presence is downplayed by the general manager of the World Meeting of Families, Anne Griffin. “For all large-scale events we plan for the worst,” she says. “So it would be remiss of the State not to plan as they do for every event. In terms of mortuaries, that is something that exists all the time. So there is nothing new or nothing fresh in regards to that.”She points out it is not only deaths organisers are prepared for. At the final Mass at the last World Meeting of Families event in Philadelphia in 2015 there were “six ladies who were brought from the event to maternity hospitals and they had their babies, so there are good things that can happen too,” Ms Griffin said. “At all events we plan to make sure that all people will be safe and if anyone has an emergency of kind they will be looked after.”The OPW and the council have been preparing since the spring. The park gates have been widened temporarily, pathways within the park have been marked out, welfare hubs, way-finding, security and stewarding facilities have been put in place, as have waste-management plans and emergency services access points. Jennifer Gilna of the NTA says it had been working on plans for six months and has a team made up of all the key stakeholders. “This is the largest event anyone around the table has worked on and we want to make sure we have really robust public transport system in place so everybody who wants to see the pope can get there, but also we want to make sure that people who have no interest in seeing the pope can go about their business without being inconvenienced,” she says.Ms Gilna’s team will be arriving in the park from 4am on the Sunday morning to keep things moving and she anticipates everything will run smoothly apart from unavoidable delays.“It’s basically going to be seven All-Ireland finals at the same time, so there will be some queuing, but we will get people in and out as fast as we possibly can.”Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris were referred to as “godless”, “sinners”, an “instrument of the devil” and as promoting the “legalised butchery of our children” for supporting the repeal of the Eighth Amendment.Freedom of Information documents released to The  detail\u0026nbspthe significant number of correspondence Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris received in response to the referendum on removing the constitutional ban on abortion.While there was some praise for the two politicians for their role, a large volume of what was released to The  highlighted the opposition to the referendum.There were also several pieces of correspondence questioning whether\u0026nbsp“compulsory euthanasia” would follow the introduction of abortion.In one letter sent on the day of the referendum count, Mr Harris was referred to as an “instrument of the devil” who was “pure evil”.Another piece of correspondence received by Mr Harris and Mr Varadkar after the result claimed the two had “blood on their hands”, while the writer insisted they would not pay for an “innocent and defenceless life to be taken away”.The extent of the hostility to the proposal is evident in the letters sent to the Taoiseach and the Minister in the days running up to the referendum.One writer claimed abortion was worse than the use of chemical weaponry in Syria, while another questioned how Mr Harris would justify “the crime of abortion” when he comes before “the Almighty”.In another letter sent to both the Taoiseach and the Minister, the writer questioned why abortion was necessary due to the availability of birth control.“We fought for birth control plus the pill, injections, condoms . . . This is freedom to have sex and *** get pregnant. So why would any woman not use these methods? A very irresponsible one and we seem to have those in the thousands.”The same writer said Mr Varadkar, who is a doctor, should perform abortions and not force other medical professionals to carry out the procedure.The person questioned why people should trust politicians and doctors, comparing it to people trusting serial killers Myra Hindley and Fred West.“We can abort the baby from the womb but never from the mind. The unwanted baby is trash to you all . . . I would not throw any of my animals in the bin. They are buried in the garden, they are in my heart and mind.”Abortion is “literally opening the door to hell”, one writer says, adding women who have abortions will feel “guilt, shame, depression, despair, attempted suicide and suicide”.In another handwritten letter, Mr Varadkar was informed he had no right to “kill little babies and setting up slaughter houses”.“You are lucky you have survived the slaughter of abortion. May God bless you and give you guidance,” the letter concludes.A mother-of-six wrote to Mr Harris days before people cast their vote on May 25th urging him to change his position on the referendum and stop “trying to murder all the innocent babies”.She said she was a doctor who could not support abortion, including in the case of rape.The woman wrote: “Abortion for a rape must be worse than the actual rape when one look(s) back and realise(s) I was talked into murdering this innocent child.”The Minister for Health also received a letter from a person who said abortion should not be permitted when the foetus was “created at a time not suitable for mam and dad or they are not perfect”.The letter says the “wildlife will have more protection than our unborn babies”.The issues of Down syndrome, the role of politicians in framing the legislation and the introduction of euthanasia feature in significant piece s of correspondence.In one letter to Mr Varadkar, a person says there will be “no babies” for people who vote Yes.“That will include no nieces or nephews for you and then our country will be left with an ageing population.”The writer finishes the handwritten letter urging Mr Varadkar to “do the right thing and stop the murder of innocent babies”.Mr Harris, meanwhile, received a letter from a Fine Gael supporter, who said their family had voted for the party since 1922 but would not anymore due to the Minister and the Taoiseach’s view on the Eighth Amendment.It was a “monstrously wrong” position and will change the ethos of Ireland irreversibly, the writer concludes.The correspondence released from the Department of Health includes several letters from women praising Mr Harris for his role in the referendum campaign.In a letter sent to Mr Harris after the result, one voter questioned the celebratory scenes in Dublin Castle on the day of the referendum count.The writer said the Minister may have“rejoiced at the sight of Ireland’s citizens dancing with joy at the idea of more easily available abortion” but stressed “thousands of others were weeping at the potential loss of babies to be aborted in years to come: unique children with potential gifts never to be repeated”.A Yes voter also contacted the Minister to criticise the scenes of “triumphalism and euphoria” that she had witnessed.Her decision to support the referendum had followed much heartache and deliberation and the celebrations had made her feel sick, the mother said.“I am the mother of a Yes campaigner, the daughter of a devastated No voter, the sister-in-law of someone who had an abortion and the wife of someone who believes the proposed legislation is too liberal.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3595829.1534237963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tunisian president to seek equal inheritance rights for women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters shout slogans during a rally demanding equal inheritance rights for women, in Tunis on Monday. Photograph: Zoubeir SouissiReutersTunisia’s president Beji Caid Sebsi says he will push for a new law to ensure equality in inheritance between men and women, in a first for the Arab world where legislation derived from Islam gives male descendants twice the share of females.“I say equality of inheritance should become law,” Mr Sebsi said in a speech on Monday to coincide with Tunisian women’s day, stressing that the country’s secular constitution assured equality between all citizens.In a nod to religious feeling in the Muslim country, he said any legislation – which would have to be debated and approved by parliament – should allow those who wanted to apply Islamic rules instead to pass down their property according to their wishes.“As the president of all Tunisians, my duty is to unite and not to ide,” he said.While the proposal that was first floated last year has upset traditionalists in the country, the conservative Nahda party that is part of Mr Sebsi’s governing coalition took a neutral view. “In principle we are not opposed,” said Said Ferjani, a senior figure in the Islamist-rooted party who said the possibility to opt out of the new law would be a welcome step.Tunisia is the only country in the Arab world that has made a successful transition towards democracy following the Arab uprisings of 2011. The country’s Islamists and secular forces have forged a pact that has largely kept the peace, even if politics and the economy are often in crisis.However, the publication in June of a report commissioned by Mr Sebsi into gender equality and other personal freedoms has angered Islamist groups in Tunisia. The report recommended not only equal inheritance rights but also the abolition of capital punishment and the decriminalisation of homosexuality, sparking weeks of protest.Over the weekend, thousands of people protested in front of the parliament building in Tunis against the proposals, which they view as part of a broad attempt to undermine Islam in a country which has always been governed by a secular elite.However, Bochra Belhaj Hmida, a lawyer who led the commission that wrote the report, accused opponents of spreading disinformation to whip up public sentiment.“They portray the decriminalisation of homosexuality as allowing gay marriage whereas it just means that people should not go to jail,” she said. “They also fail to point out that it would be possible to opt out of equality of inheritance.”Since the 1950s, Tunisian family laws have departed from Islamic orthodoxy by banning polygamy and restricting a man’s unfettered right to orce his wife.These laws, unmatched anywhere in the Arab world, were adopted under the rule of Habib Bourguiba, the country’s first post-independence ruler, an authoritarian who also saw himself as a moderniser.Analysts say Mr Sebsi, who is in his 90s and served under Mr Bourguiba, wants to leave a similar legacy. The president last year scrapped administrative rules which prevented the recognition of marriages between Muslim Tunisian women and non-Muslim men. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Harith al-Sudani spent 16 months posing as a militant jihadi, foiling dozens of attacksBomb was detonated under a police car and four security men were killed in shoot-outRiyadh defends attack as \u0026lsquolegitimate military action\u0026rsquo amid calls for independent inquiryTwelve children among those killed in the incident in the rebel-held Idlib provinceFears that many thousands of civilians could be displaced in event of devastating battleEllie Holman: \u0026lsquoThis situation has cost us . . . all of our savings, which is devastating to us\u0026rsquoIsraeli tanks fire at Hamas post after grenade reportedly thrown at its troops on the borderThe two were reportedly denied food, water and access to toilets while in custodyAttack on Thursday draws international condemnation and calls to end conflictIsraeli aircraft struck over 150 targets in Gaza on Wednesday night and ThursdayUS-backed, Saudi-led coalition hits bus in rebel-held north of war-torn countryChild among three killed in Israeli strikes in response to rocket attacks by HamasSyria\u0026rsquos first lady is reportedly being treated at a military hospital in DamascusOpposition chief Tzipi Livni apologises to Druze community for discriminatory lawTehran cuts imports of non-essential goods and introduces subsidies on food, medicineKingdom sells off Canadian assets after ambassador expelled over minister\u0026rsquos criticismAlmost two-thirds back Palestinian Authority\u0026rsquos rejection of US as mediator, poll revealsRe-imposed blanket sanctions to hit Iran\u0026rsquos access to dollars, gold and precious metalsCanada said it was \u0026lsquogravely concerned\u0026rsquo about the arrests of civil society and women\u0026rsquos rights activists in Saudi ArabiaSenior Saudi officials allow the Bin Ladens to tell their story"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Plain and flavoured noodles also performed better.The magazine said: “Shoppers have a new squeeze when it comes to carbohydrates. Rice and noodles are viewed as everything many say the spud is not – healthy, convenient and exotic. Many, particularly millennial and Generation Z consumers, see spuds as stodge that will make them fat. To boot, they’re often a faff to prepare.”RECIPE | Sweet potato fries with banana ketchupPotato aficionados, however, maintain the vegetable has not suffered a dip in popularity and disputed the figures. Christine Watts, marketing officer of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), said statistics by consumer data company Kantar WorldPanel showed potato sales had increased by 2.6 per cent since 2015, with sales of fresh potatoes alone showing a rise of 2.1 per cent.The AHDB even launched a “Love Potatoes” campaign designed to highlight the vegetable’s nutritional value to younger consumers through Instagram as well as other forms of social media.Ms Watts said: “Our hugely successful Potatoes: More than a Bit on the Side campaign was launched in July 2015, with the aim of re-engaging younger consumers with the potato, demonstrating its health and nutritional virtues, as well as showing modern and contemporary ways in which they can be used to fit in with today’s busy lifestyles.”According to The Grocer, microwaveable rice, which it said was only introduced into the market around 15 years ago, is now worth £250 million a year.Please review our commenting policyWestminster crash outside Parliament treated as terror attack after car hits cyclists and ploughs into barriers - latestHow the terror threat we face has ersified since the 1970sWatch the moment armed police swarm crashed car outside ParliamentWhy Turkey\u0026#39s currency crisis means ultra-cheap holidays for BritonsVenezuela abandons petrol subsidies as inflation set to hit one million per centThree-year-old found at squalid desert hideout died in \u0026#39demonic\u0026#39 ritualFormer archbishop Philip Wilson confronted by angry victims after child sex abuse sentenceA year of denials: How Jeremy Corbyn changed his story over Munich terror tributeM25 coach overturns: Baby born in tailbacks as seven children among 41 injured in Kent crashUtah man crashes a plane into his home after a fight with his wifeExam boards launch review as parents exploit mental health loophole to get students extra timeThousands of couples \u0026#39exaggerate marriage faults to get orce\u0026#39 The terrifying Cold War roots of space weapons - and why Donald Trump\u0026#39s message is \u0026#39vital\u0026#39Scientists hail DNA breakthrough that can detect if people are likely to have heart attacksNew Zealand man accused of attempted murder in Bali after scooter accidentPain-relieving drug \u0026#39reduces need for epidural during labour\u0026#39Young shoplifters?

After heavy rainfall it is common for river banks to burst, submerging nearby towns and villages. This means cars and buses become redundant and people are forced to travel by boat.

He also said whole floors of larger House Fraser branches could be given to Flannels or Sports Direct.House of Fraser collapsed into administration after struggling to stay on top of costs, admitting that it could no longer afford to pay rents on a number of its stores.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/08/25/14/exam-result.jpg","title":"a level results day 2018 unconditional offers drop top grades alan smithers","story":"Created with Sketch.If students\u0026nbspwith unconditional\u0026nbspoffers \u0027take their foot off the pedal\u0027\u0026nbspthey may not\u0026nbspget\u0026nbsphigh gradesClick to followThe Independent OnlineStudents may have ‘taken their foot off the pedal’ during exams following a rise in guaranteed places on degree coursesThe soaring number of unconditional offers handed out by universities could lead to a drop in the proportion of exams awarded the top grades this week, experts have suggested.Students may have “taken their foot off the pedal” following a rise in guaranteed places on degree courses, resulting in a potential drop in the percentage of A or A* grades, academics have said.Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, added that major reforms to A-levels in England – as well as a rise of unconditional offers – could bring down the overall pass rate for the highest grades this year.His warnings come ahead of A-level results day on Thursday, when\u0026nbspthousands of students across the country will find out what grades they have got in their exams and what university they may study at.Recent figures published by Ucas showed that nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of teenagers have received at least one unconditional offer this year amid competition to attract candidates.In total, almost 68,000 of these offers have been made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year, up from less than 3,000 just five years ago.The issue has sparked concerns from ministers and school leaders, who have argued the practice undermines the credibility of the university system and puts youngsters’ futures at risk.If those given a guaranteed offer “really take their foot off the pedal, they may not be getting the high grades that they might otherwise have done”, Professor Smithers said.There have also been major changes to A-levels in England – with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course. Last year, the first grades were awarded in the first 13 subjects to be reformed – and the proportion of top grades fell in these subjects.A further 11 A-level subjects – including languages, geography, dance, drama and theatre, music, PE and religious studies – have now been reformed with grades awarded for the first time this year.Professor Smithers said: “Putting together the fact that 24 of the most frequently taken A-levels have changed in England, and that we’ve got unconditional offers operating, they’re likely to bring the results down a bit.”But the exams regulator Ofqual has said they will make sure that students are not penalised for being the first to take new exams – as final grades would be fairly distributed.Experts have also predicted that boys will score more A and A* grades than girls in the new A-levels, which are tested by exams, rather than coursework.On unconditional offers, Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “If there is a dip in the top grades, it could well be due to youngsters taking their foot off the gas. I do think it’s something that we have to look at.”He added: “We’re very concerned that universities are doing this to get bums on seats.“Whereas, in fact what should be happening in the process is that students are on the most appropriate degree provision for them, for what their potential career progression is going to be, and if the nature of the course that they’re doing is best suited to them.”Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of vice-chancellors’\u0026nbspgroup Universities UK, said that unconditional offers still account for a small proportion (7.1 per cent) of all offers made.He said: “They are made in a range of circumstances.These include when applicants already have qualifications or extensive practical and relevant experience for courses such as music or journalism.“They can also be awarded where evidence suggests applicants are clearly on track to exceed the required entry grades, and to those from disadvantaged backgrounds with the potential to do well at university with extra support.“Unconditional offers, when used appropriately, can help students and ensure that universities are able to respond flexibly to the range of applicants seeking places.“Universities UK will continue to work with Ucas to monitor trends and any impact unconditional offer-making might have on exam results.”UK news in picturesCommunities Secretary James Brokenshire today launched a £100 million pound government fund to end rough sleeping in England within the next decade.

Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/10/rtx2sh01.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1587  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/10/rtx2sh01.jpg","title":"mike ashley house of fraser sports direct store closures","story":"Created with Sketch.The retail tycoon plans to introduce more luxury brands at the department store, including Gucci and PradaClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe retailer had previously announced the closure of 31 out of its total 59 stores, but the new owner told the Sun that he will try to keep most of the branches open.  “In a year’s time you can hold my feet to the fire on that,” he said.

These included 97 English seats, 14 in Wales and one in Scotland.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The shallow argument against giving the people their say diminishes towards nothingness with every passing day.”Sir Vince told the Bristol rally that opponents of Brexit must work together “as a team” across party ides in the drive for a second EU referendum.The Lib Dem leader said it was clear the “centre of gravity” on Brexit is shifting in favour of a national poll on the final deal.Sir Vince told the rally that since the 52 per cent-48 per cent victory for Leave in 2016, “the situation has changed, the facts have changed”.“We were all told the British government was going to save vast amounts of money,” he said. “We now know that’s not the case: there’s the £40bn orce settlement, the economy’s slowing down, there’s less money for the NHS.“We were told it was simple – it’s actually proving unbelievably complicated.“Another thing that’s happened in the last two years is Trump. The whole premise of Britain embarking on some buccaneering free trading adventure around the world as a country independent of the EU has been completely negated by Trump’s protectionist agenda.

Great Britain\u0026rsquo. Well that\u0026rsquos an added bonus.As well as the beauty of swimming alongside dolphins and even a Minke whale which followed him for a while in the Bristol Channel, Ross has had to cope with a disintegrating tongue due to \u0026ldquosalt mouth, the danger of submerged rocks, fiendish tides and the toughest waves our nation can muster.There have been basking sharks, wetsuit chafing and the pain of relentless jellyfish stings to his face while swimming up to 31 nautical miles a day \u0026ndash something he achieved in the Irish Sea when he got caught in an extreme tide.\u0026ldquoThe armoured fortified beard is my secret weapon, he laughs as he considers his new facial hair.\u0026ldquoThe jellyfish ricochet off it. I\u0026rsquove also developed really good peripheral vision to identify them and give them a wide berth when I can. And to cope with salt tongue, which meant bits of my tongue were literally falling off, I now lubricate my mouth with coconut oil.Holidays 2018: From Mauritius to the Males, be in awe of some of the most beautiful swimming pools revealed by Emirates Holidays.

But never once, even when my tongue was falling apart and I\u0026rsquove been stung in the face so often I\u0026rsquom feeling dizzy from the toxins, have I thought I was going to quit.Not so surprising when you consider that Ross kicked off 2018 by completing a marathon while dragging a Mini Cooper behind him for the entire course.In 2016 he achieved the world\u0026rsquos longest rope climb by scaling a rope repeatedly until reaching the equivalent height of Mount Everest \u0026ndash 8,848 metres \u0026ndash in less than 24 hours (working his way through two pairs of shoes and 10 pairs of gloves in the process).\u0026ldquoThe mindset you choose is what makes it easier and more enjoyable, he declares. \u0026ldquoAnd the support of the amazing team on the boat.This includes his girlfriend of five years Hester Sabery, 27, who joins the boat most weekends.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos really nice to have that sense of home, Ross says. \u0026ldquoAnd Hester can treat wounds that others probably wouldn\u0026rsquot want to treat.

Other times I think about what I\u0026rsquom going to eat next, he says of his serious banana habit fuelled by his on-board nutritionist. In longer breaks he might read from Meditations by philosopher Marcus Aurelius.\u0026ldquoSwimming magnifies your feelings, whether positive or negative. I try to keep them positive.

The scenery has been amazing but the people have made this special.He has also put on weight in a bid to keep warm in the eye-wateringly cold temperatures. \u0026ldquoI have now got this tummy to store body fat.It means I\u0026rsquom better at cuddling but also at staying warm.But Ross, who learnt to swim at the age of six, denies that his swimming style is anything to write home about.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom like a whale, not pretty at all. With endurance swimming I barely kick my legs \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos 90 per cent arms because kicking only accounts for about 10 per cent propulsion so I\u0026rsquom more efficient if I don\u0026rsquot use them.

So I bought a rope. Found a tree. Then put a date in the diary.And he started his bizarre 24-hour endurance climb which saw him scale the 10-metre rope nearly 900 times before stopping. But he admits that his latest extreme stunt \u0026ldquomakes the others look like a warm-up.The idea for the Great British Swim was sparked partly by GB Row, the \u0026lsquoworld\u0026rsquos toughest\u0026rsquo rowing race which circumnavigates the UK and is notorious because of the tides, the currents and the unpredictability of the coast- line around Britain.\u0026ldquoI thought, \u0026lsquoIf that\u0026rsquos the toughest rowing race, why don\u0026rsquot I enter it, just without a boat.\u0026rsquo People have run around Great Britain, cycled around it and rowed around it. No one has swum around it. It seemed like it just needed doing, he adds, before getting back in the chilly Scottish waters.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn about her reality TV romances rarely last beyond the first glossy magazine spread.I’M not in the least bit surprised that doctors don’t trust us to tell the truth when it comes to how much booze we guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be watching from behind the sofa to find out the fate of our heroine June.She inhabits a world where women have no rights, and handmaids are ritually raped, mutilated and even killed.It’s not easy viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional rollercoaster and Miss Moss should clear her sideboard for a slew of awards.The Handmaid’s Tale, Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm.WHAT sad news to discover that Margot Kidder, who shone so very brightly as the feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for likening woman who wear burkas to letter boxes.It’s his opinion.You very well might disagree, but getting him to say sorry won’t make him stop thinking such thoughts.He will just stop writing and uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How many traditional Labour voters today share his worldview?It is Boris, derided by his enemies as an Etonian toff, who has his finger on the nation’s pulse and understands the concerns of ordinary people.No surprise that in one poll the Tories have opened a four-point lead over Corbyn’s Labour.After a short summer break following our fantastic World Cup, it is great to have the beautiful game back.We’ve already witnessed breathtaking goals, crunching tackles and some blinding saves.And there is nowhere better to get the best football coverage than inside Britain’s favourite newspaper.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats when I called Sarah and asked her to book me a flight home.Alun revealed that Sarah wasnt best pleased when she first wound out what happened - but had since made him promise her a trip to Amsterdam as pay back.He said: She calls me out but our rows are always in good spirit.She text back saying You are winding me up, what an idiot.But finished off telling me to have a good time.The playful dad said Sarah wasnt a nagging girlfriend, adding: But she has said Ive got to take her away now to make up for it so we are looking at a trip to Amsterdam.Hopefully this time I can give my boss a bit more notice.It was thanks to Sarah that the pair managed to get home - booking the pair the first flight back.Sarah said: The best part is that I had to rescue the boys and get them a flight home when theyd had enough.People have messaged me saying Im a mug for forgiving him but there was no fall out.Its all been a big laugh and Im just glad he was safe and they stuck together even if they did go a bit too wild.The couple have been best mates for nearly three years and only recently took their relationship to the next level.They have now been seeing each other for 8 weeks and live around the corner from each other on the Gurnos estate in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.Dad-of-four Alun said: We love the banter, its one of the reasons we are great together.

In any other customer facing industry we’d be looking at proper refunds.”And Treasury aide Chris Philp insisted Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had to deliver on plans announced in June to give commuters on Southern a month’s worth of compensation.He said: “No one who has suffered should be paying more next year. People have paid for a service and it’s not been received.”Labour demanded a fare freeze on Sunday – and called for a windfall tax on train operators.Official inflation figures tomorrow are due to show retail prices rose by 3.5 per cent in July. The July figure is taken as the basis for annual fare hikes in January.A 3.5 per cent rise would push up season tickets for between London and Ashford by £188 to £5,567, London and Southampton by £200 to £5,902. A season ticket from Macclesfield to Manchester on troubled Northern Rail would also rise by £90 to £2,663.The hikes come after a summer marked by timetabling chaos and cancelled services across the country.Southern has warned passengers this week they face 34 days of disruption on the Brighton to London mainline from September due to “improvement” works. Fares across the UK have soared by 40 per cent over the past decade.The Department for Transport yesterday said that while further hikes were “unwelcome” they were essential to funding work on the railways. But Tories have urged the Government to follow ex-Chancellor George Osborne – who capped regulated rail fares in 2011.Insiders argue that unions must share part of the blame for soaring ticket prices as around 25p in every £1 spent goes on wages. Labour’s former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis said customer dissatisfaction was running at levels that would “shame” the likes of major supermarkets.He stormed: “Watchdogs Which? say that one in five rail passengers are dissatisfied with their last journey. Imagine that was a supermarket, with one in five dissatisfied with the last food they bought. Passengers shouldn’t be expected to pay more for worse.”After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here is part of the answer.“Either the Government have taken their eye off the ball or they have been too heavily influenced by a small group of companies and have ignored their own.”Migration Watch said that since 1992, the number of ICTs (inter-company transfers) has increased eightfold. In 1997 the Home Office issued around 15,000 to workers and their families.This jumped to 47,000 in 2007 and 58,000 last year.Two types of ICTs can be issued – from long-term staff visas to permits for graduate trainees.Migration Watch’s blast comes just weeks after official figures revealed non-EU immigration pushed net migration to nearly 300,000 in the first full year since the Brexit referendum.Net migration from EU nations fell to just over 100,000 in 2017 – the lowest level in five years.

What we would like to do is introduce a ‘concierge click and collect’ at House of Fraser.“When you go online and say you want to collect goods in-store, you should be able to book a time, book a changing room and book a stylist.“You get that kind of personal shopping service in a Harrods. There’s no reason why it couldn’t be rolled out nationally across House of Fraser.”Sports Direct, which already held an 11 per cent stake, bought House of Fraser outright just hours after it went into administration.It was left on the brink of collapse after the Chinese owner of toy store Hamleys pulled out of a £70million rescue deal.House of Fraser, which its new owner affectionately calls “HoF”, employs 17,000, including 11,500 in-store concession staff.Ashley, who is worth around £3billion, believes the key to securing its future is to introduce more luxury brands.He added that big-hitters such as Gucci, Prada, Stone Island and Mallet footwear were “the biggest thing missing” as House of Fraser ran into the red.Drawing on his experience with designer chain Flannels, which is owned by Sports Direct, he intends to stock House of Fraser with successful “cool brands of the moment”.He said: “We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands. We think it will make a big difference.“It is not taking away from House of Fraser, but adding to it.“If you get the right product, it is not on the shelves for long.”Larger House of Fraser stores, such as the one in Birmingham, could see whole floors turned over to Sports Direct or Flannels, Ashley added.Among the stores that could be saved from closure is the Oxford Street flagship in London — if landlords and suppliers can be won over.Ashley admitted that landlords have been “battered and bruised” by a raft of retail tenants seeking rent reductions this year.In a message to them, he said: “Give us a chance and we will try to keep as many open as we can. We are here to get House of Fraser back to where it once was.”However, some analysts are sceptical that the colourful billionaire can pull it off.Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb warned: “It is far from clear if he really knows what he has taken on.”HOUSE OF FRASER lost its way but Ashley wants to take it upmarket with more luxury bestsellers, brands popular with younger customers and a personal shopper service.SPORTS DIRECT’s superstores are full of popular brands, including Lonsdale and Donnay.

I don’t think I was actually involved in it.“I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere.”Published pictures show Mr Corbyn clutching a large floral wreath during a visit to the Cemetery of the Martyrs of Palestine in Tunisia.Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger yesterday said Mr Corbyn’s nit-picking over whether he actually laid a wreath was beyond the point.She said: “Being ‘present’ is the same as being involved.“When I attend a memorial my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. There can also never be a ‘fitting memorial’ for terrorists. Where is the apology?”The row will only further inflame the rows within Labour over anti-semitism and alleged slurs likening Israelis to Nazis.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted yesterday: “The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorists who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between.”It sparked an extraordinary public spat as Mr Corbyn hit back by tweeting: “What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.”Hard-left Labour MP Chris Williamson joined in, saying: “Benjamin Netanyahu leads a brutal rightwing apartheid regime. He has no moral authority whatsoever to criticise anyone, Let alone a man of peace.”Mr Corbyn’s admission that he was present at the wreath ceremony was made yesterday during a campaign visit to Walsall.It contradicted a statement from his own office denying he was there.The Labour press office also said those who claimed that Mr Corbyn was at the ceremony were misleading the widows of the murdered Israeli athletes, who have called on the Labour leader to apologise.Jewish Tory MP Andrew Percy said: “Jeremy Corbyn is a liar and has been found out. This is a sickening new low.”Labour Friends of Israel accused Mr Corbyn’s party of trying to “cover up” his visit.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis said Mr Corbyn’s changing accounts showed him to be “unfit for senior public office”.He said the Labour leader had “completely divorced” himself from the party’s tradition of fighting anti-Semitism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mum and dad were doing them.We woke up the next day and thought it was hilarious. We sent pictures to our parents and and they were like that better not be permanent.It was absolutely fine until about eight days later then it was so itchy and it felt like it was burning.It was so red. It was all raised up. Now it looks a bit like eczema and is very dry.She went to a pharmacy when she got back to the UK and was told to go to a walk-in centre.Beth, who is taking a gap year after finishing her A-Levels this summer, added: I thought that was a bit extreme so I went to the doctor on the Monday.I said to them that I was probably overreacting but I needed to know if it was going to scar permanently because when I looked it up it said you needed to be treated for chemical burns.I was so worried it would scar me forever.The doctors told me Id had an allergic reaction to it and it would take about six months to go completely.Beth was prescribed a steroid cream and told that due to the chemicals in black henna also being used in hair dyes, she would no longer be able to dye her hair.She added: She [the pharmacist] was very firm on it because she said my body would start attacking whats in the hair dye and that I could actually die.That was the worst thing for me - not being able to dye my hair.Beth says everyone was shouting the phrase made popular by the character Jim on the show, which is about two brothers who return home for dinner with their parents every Friday night.Beth said: I love the show - its hilarious. Friday Night Dinner seems to be the thing that young people are obsessed with at the moment.It was everywhere in Zante. People would shout different lines back at each other.Warning others against the dangers, Beth said: I would 100 per cent say do not get black henna.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman.

For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire.

But I can tell some of them are thinking ‘are you for real?’“I feel like a bit of a tink turning up to job interviews wearing a tracksuit, T-shirt and trainers — but I would look ridiculous if I was wearing smart clothes and my big white trainers.”David added: “It’s been a total nightmare and very embarrassing. I feel like I have tried everywhere in Scotland but nobody does my size.“And I get people making fun of me when I’m at the bus stop or walking down the street people say ‘Wow. look at him. Are those boats on your feet?’. Others call me ‘banana feet’.It’s demoralising. I think I’d have a job if I had shoes. It brings me down and it’s pretty hurtful.“I just want to get back to work. I can’t be the only person in the UK with size 19 feet.”David, who is 6ft 2in tall and weighs in at 24 stone, has had big feet since he was youngster.When he left school he was a size 16. But he could find shoes that fitted him at the time and worked in retail, cleaning and security jobs through his 20s.But since then his feet have grown three sizes and are almost 12in long and 7in wide. David says he has been turned down by at least ten employers since he last worked.His worried girlfriend Annie Jones, 32, said she hopes he can resolve the situation and land a job.Annie said: “People laugh at him. They point at him and call him names. It’s mean when they call him “clown shoes” and it gets him down.I hope he can get back to work. It would mean a lot to him.”Do you have bigger feet?

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Roberts drove into the back of the car, but no one was injured.Roberts was made to do a breathalyser test, which came back with two different readings.The mum was then tested for alcohol in her blood and the result came back to reveal that she was more than three times the legal limit.Prosecuting, Steve Woodman, said: “On May 28 at around 3.30pm, a Ms Dyson was driving along Pickmere Lane in Cheshire and she came behind a Ford vehicle that was veering across the lanes.“She overtook the Ford car and saw the driver, Laura Roberts, and thought that she looked drunk. As she moved in front of the Ford car, it went into the back of her car.“Ms Dyson got out and spoke to Roberts and called the police. The police came and did a breathalyser test and found her to have two readings - 150mg of alcohol in her breath and 130mg.“As they had two separate readings, they took a sample of blood and they got a reading of 266mg in 100ml of blood - which is well over three times the limit.“In an interview, she said she had been drinking. She had been at a festival with her children and the previous day she had been drinking toffee flavoured vodka.“She said she then woke up in the morning and had a glass of wine. She then left the festival at two in the afternoon.“After the accident, she said that she was beginning to feel the wine that she had earlier that day. Her children were in the car at the time.”Defending, Maria Brannon, said: “She is of good character, with no previous convictions, and has been driving for 19 years with no endorsements.“She has two daughters who are two and four years of age, and she is well regarded in her job working in administration at Wigan Council.“She was at the Geronimo Festival in Cheshire with her children and her and her friend had been camping there and they didn’t drive home until after lunch.“A combination of the alcohol from the night before and the sunburn made her feel ill when she was driving home.“Ms Roberts is aware that she is going to be disqualified from driving today.“Ms Roberts is very ashamed of what happened. Since her husband left her 20 months ago, she has been the sole, primary carer of her children and has been working very hard.“This incident was completely out of character for her and it is highly unlikely that she will commit an offence like this again.“This was a special treat for her children after the difficult 18 months they had since her husband left.She went with her two children and another family to the festival at Arley Hall.“She said that she felt tired just before she drove home but put it down to sunburn. So, she decided to drive - a decision that she bitterly regrets.“She took a wrong turn and got lost down a country lane and this was where the accident happened.“A woman had driven in front of her and Ms Roberts had not seen her until it was too late.She was very apologetic to the woman and the police and there was no damage caused to the car.“Ms Roberts bitterly regrets her decision to drive with the children in the back of her car. However, it must be said that there are no social services involved in the matter and it’s not in dispute that she has been an excellent mother in difficult circumstances.“She is distraught that she put her own children and future at risk.“But there are mitigating factors. First of all, the immediate guilty plea secondly her lack of previous convictions, and also her exemplary character. She is the sole primary career of her two young children.”Roberts was given a 12 months community order and will have to do 100 hours of unpaid work.She was also banned from driving for 2 years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/parliament-crash-71.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"westminster car witnesses cyclists","story":"Barry Williams told the Victoria Derbyshire show he saw cyclists knocked to the ground as a silver vehicle careered into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament.The BBC worker said: I saw a silver car heading towards cyclists on the wrong side of the road.

And then accelerated and hit it at quite high speed“It hit with quite a thud. The car actually came off the ground and landed again.“He hit about five cyclists. One actually got up and began to chase the car.This is what we know so far...“It was frightening. The police were very fast - they vaulted over the barrier followed by armed police.”The driver, in his 20s, was arrested on suspicion of terrorist offences and led away in handcuffs before cops confirmed the Mets Counter-Terrorism Command is now leading the investigation.Witnesses told of horror scenes as the car driving up to 50mph crashed outside Parliament just after 7.30am.Eyewitness Jason Williams said: Someone driving towards Parliament at speed, it wasnt a minor accident, it wasnt a road traffic incident.It was, in my opinion, something planned and something very sinister.Another witness Ewalina Ochab added: I think it looked intentional - the car drove at speed and towards the barriers.I was walking on the other side (of the road). I heard some noise and someone screamed.A chilling video showed cyclists sprawled injured in the street moments after the car smashed into barriers.A COBRA meeting is due to take place at 2pm to discuss this mornings suspected terrorist incident.Dramatic footage after the crash shows heavily-armed police pointing rifles inside a silver car after it crashed into black barriers.A London Ambulance spokesman said two people were taken to hospital and one was treated at the scene - with none thought to have life-threatening injuries.Mr Williams later told ITVs Good Morning Britain that the incident was very, very scary.He said: I’ve seen a man driving a vehicle, and hes gone into one of the bollards. There was a loud bang.Straight away I thought Oh no, this is another terrorist attack. So I’ve just started to run and the police were saying get out, get out of the area.The incident comes just over a year after terrorist Khalid Masood drove into pedestrians and rammed the gates of Parliament in a terror attack.The jihadi killed five people including Westminster cop PC Keith Palmer before he was shot dead by armed police.Streets around Parliament Square, Millbank and Victoria Tower Gardens have been cordoned off with dozens of police, ambulances and firefighters at the scene.While Westminster Bridge has been closed to cars and pedestrians and nearby Lambeth Bridge is also to be shut imminently."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426597058.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"breastfeeding mum tears cafe customer slammed her","story":"Nikki Davis, 32, was told by the customer that she was putting her off her teacake.The mum says she also overheard the customer describe them as the mammary brigade.She said: This was really distressing to hear and actually made me cry.I met two friends from my National Childbirth Trust class.

The good news is that spending quality time with the ones you love doesn’t have to be expensive. Here are some suggestions for activities the family will love without costing the Earth… 1. Pimp an old bike A bike ride is a fantastic way to spend time with the kids, and it can be combined with a low-cost picnic for an even nicer day. Anyone with small people in their lives will vouch for the fact that they don’t stay small for long. The advantage? They quickly outgrow their bikes, meaning there’s likely to be plenty of friends and family with once-loved models gathering dust in the garage or shed.  If your child doesn’t have a bike, speak to friends, neighbours – or check out Freecycle . Once you’ve got your hands on some pre-loved wheels, take your bike to Halfords for a Free Bike Check . In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. If they spot anything that needs attention, they can fix it too. If you\u0027d prefer to go new than second hand, Halfords currently has a range of kids\u0027 bikes at up to 30% off - like the BMX-style Apollo Ace Kids\u0027 Bike, \u0026pound63 (save \u0026pound27), which is suitable for ages three to 11 - depending on the model.  2. Get them growing   Kids love getting their hands dirty – and if you have a garden or access to an allotment then you can join forces to tackle the weeds and grow some wonderful flowers, fruit and vegetables. Reward the littl’un who pulls up the most weeds, hold a sunflower growing competition, or see who can coax the biggest marrow from the soil. You can encourage kids to help by letting them choose their own plants: fruits like strawberries and tomatoes are also fun and reasonably simple to grow – they also have a tasty reward at the end! 3. Make some real lemonade  Making real lemonade is simple to do, inexpensive and unbeatable on a warm day. Gather some lemons, sugar and water (you’ll need roughly 140g of caster sugar and 1 litre of water for every three lemons).  Once it\u0027s ready, enjoy in the shade of the Halfords 250 Fully Waterproof Gazebo, \u0026pound39 (save \u0026pound11) - perfect for covering a lemonade stand or an outdoor play area. 4. Go hunting for bats   Bats are glorious creatures, and the summer months are a good time to get out and spot them. As the sun sets you can usually spot these flying mammals darting about in the sky. Their erratic flight patterns mean they\u0027re easy to distinguish from birds, and keeping an eye out for them is a great way to spend an evening. You can also head to your local park with an evening picnic – use the Halfords Coolbag Trolley , \u0026pound15 (half price), to get your food there with minimal carrying effort. As it gets dark, lie back on a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket,\u0026pound10 (half price), and spot the sonar-equipped mosquito-munchers in action.  Or, if you\u0027re looking to go further afield, why not take the Urban Escape 6 Person Vis A Vis Tent along and make it an overnight trip. It\u0027s currently half price at just \u0026pound125. Take some facts about bats with you too, so the little ones will learn about one of nature\u0027s most misunderstood creatures. For example, bats can – apparently – consume up to 1,200 mosquitos per hour and will sometimes eat their own bodyweight in insects in a single night. You\u0027ll find loads of information and details about organised Bat Walks on the Bat Conservation Trust\u0027s website. 5. Get them stargazing Those summer nights are ideal for checking out the cosmos. The lack of clouds means uninterrupted views of the universe and the hot weather means you\u0027ll get a nice warm evening to gaze into space. You don\u0027t need special equipment for basic stargazing. Apps for your phone will tell you what\u0027s visible, and guide you to interesting stars and planets, as well as giving you the names of constellations. The Moon often looks stunning, and it\u0027s also possible to spot Jupiter and Saturn in the night sky using the naked eye. If you have a decent pair of binoculars you can also spot nebulae and get a great view of our solar system. The Moon, in particular, is a great thing to examine with binoculars.  An Urban Escape King Size Moon Chair , \u0026pound30 (half price), is the perfect spot (with the perfect name) for checking out the cosmos. If you get the bug, check out your local stargazing club. Often you\u0027d be expected to take your own telescope but many would be thrilled to let you experience the night sky through their equipment – check the internet and don\u0027t be afraid to fire off an email. 6. Watch a movie in the moonlight   Across the country there are multiple places to catch a movie in the great outdoors. Search hard enough and you might even find free outdoor movies near you. Taking in a movie on the big screen outdoors can be a great way to spend time with the family. Pack yourselves a nice supper in the Summerhouse Seville 4 Person Wicker Picnic Basket, \u0026pound69.99 - and don’t forget to include the popcorn! 7. Take a low-cost road trip "},{"url":null,"title":"mad boris tea party tells","story":"NewsopinionThe Mad Boris tea party tells us all we need to know about this shabby charlatanGiving tea to journalists is an old trick - and Boris did it badlyShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist13:26, 13 AUG 2018Updated14:07, 13 AUG 2018NewsopinionGet politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email When grizzled old hacks gather to share stories of scandals past, it is not unknown for them to speak fondly of Mary Archer.  The fragrant wife of convicted perjurer and former Tory deputy chairman Sir Jeffrey is still beloved, three decades later, for bringing a cup of tea to the press pack gathered outside their Cambridgeshire vicarage during one of her husband\u0027s many scandals. That someone hounded and pursued by the forces of Fleet Street should be so hospitable was considered remarkable, even heroic. It bought her considerable goodwill, not just because a small village in Cambridgeshire is bereft of places to buy tea but also because, when on a job miles from anywhere, bored and stood outside in all weathers, it is a civilising pleasure to drink from china rather than Styrofoam. It humanises those on all sides - if hunter and hunted both drink tea, they think the other can\u0027t be all bad. It is a moment of peace and acknowledgement of the other\u0027s tribulations, like Christmas Day football between enemies in World War One. It doesn\u0027t end the war, but it\u0027s a nice thought.  In 2007, footballer Teddy Sheringham performed the same feat when his then-girlfriend Danielle Lloyd was in the Celebrity Big Brother house and embroiled in a race row with Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty.  Only he did it half-naked.   And so it was that this weekend former Foreign Secretary and habitual-utterer-of-nasty-things Boris Johnson \u0027did a Mary\u0027, as it is known by some, and produced a tray of tea for the photographers gathered outside his country home in Oxfordshire.  There is a lot that can be gleaned from a person\u0027s tea habits, and even more from a tray produced for others. While gazing enviously at Teddy\u0027s abdomen, you will I am sure have noticed he carried a set of matching mugs, minimalist aluminium sugar caddy, and a 2-pint bottle of semi-skimmed milk, on a pleasingly biscuit-coloured wooden tray. All very stripped-down and simple. You get the impression this is a man who does not like mess, and treats strangers with the same high standards he expects in his own life. Two pints tells you he lives alone, and frugally. The tray says his kitchen is pristine, and his fingernails clean.  I\u0027m not sure what Mary\u0027s tea tray looked like - but there are rumours it involved proper cups with saucers. AND BISCUITS.  Boris did not do that. In fact, Boris could not have made more of a cock-up of it if he tried.  The tray contains a hotch-potch of thick clay mugs. One came free with an Easter egg. One looks like it usually has toothbrushes in it. Another bears a corporate logo, and one appears to be from a Battersea Power Station sponsorship programme.  They are, in short, the mugs you make the staff drink from. Mugs that don\u0027t matter.  And no sugar bowl for the snappers. No. A half-open packet of granulated, no doubt with a used spoon wedged in it.  This is a tray that screams YOU\u0027RE ALL PEASANTS, NOW SAY THANK YOU.   And bear in mind, this is the fellow\u0027s second home. He\u0027s a multi-millionaire. There\u0027s bound to be nice mugs and a milk jug in that farmhouse somewhere, he just hasn\u0027t bothered to produce them. The milk is truly boggling. The man has four children and a wife. The children are grown up, but even if they weren\u0027t at home there\u0027s a minimum of two adults there for the whole weekend, and possibly friends and political advisers visiting. A single pint of milk wouldn\u0027t last an afternoon, so anyone sane would buy a 4-pinter on the trip down from London. Which leads me to the uncomfortable conclusion that Boris is either so stupid he bought several, more expensive 1-pint bottles, or that he keeps an old 1-pinter to use as a milk jug. And that\u0027s just skanky.  He is the antithesis of Teddy Sheringham. This is a tea boy who leaves you wondering whether the mugs were washed first, and what in. His fingernails, were they to be inspected, would almost certainly contain traces of the past week\u0027s bogeys. Boris did admirably in refusing to answer questions, and declaring himself on a humanitarian mission because you have been here all day and you\u0027ve been incredibly patient. But if the purpose of his jaunt down the garden path was to buy goodwill, it failed for three simple reasons.  The first is that tea is fundamentally about good manners. The same rituals and purpose apply whether in a Japanese tea ceremony or a truckers\u0027 roadside caff. Boris\u0027 tray displays an impolite lack of consideration, and would be looked at aghast were he to offer such a thing at an official reception, to his in-laws, or to Theresa May.  But seeing as Boris is in his current disciplinary hate-crime pickle because he likened veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, manners are presumably something he lacks on a grand scale.  The second is that, if this tray is really the best he could muster, he must surely have seen that it needed adornment of some kind. Half a packet of Digestives, perhaps, or a handful of Penguins. Anything. Instead, it\u0027s as graceless as his writing. And third is the basic rule that anyone volunteering for a tea run is usually doing it to be nice - to repay an earlier run done by a colleague, to suck up to someone, or to apologise for past wrongs.  In Boris\u0027 case, he\u0027s doing it to pretend to be nice. A bit like when he and Gideon Osborne sat down with some Transport for London workers in hi-vis jackets, and tried for a photo that didn\u0027t make them look like Buller boys talking to daddy\u0027s horse valet.   In short, the best that Boris could do, when caught in a jam of his own making and confronted by journalists, was to attempt deflection with a half-hearted tea round that did little more than belittle the people he delivered it to. The proof is in the pudding with these things, and those journalists will no sooner give him an easier ride tomorrow than he will deliver them a tea pot and the family china.  Not just because since Boris\u0027 column last week there has been an increase in reported hate incidents against women wearing a face veil, but because journalists know and loathe Boris of old.  He\u0027s been fired for making up quotes from his own godfather, promised to use journalistic means to track down the address of someone a mate wanted beaten up, and has not only used his pen to foment racism but boasted of the \u0026pound250,000 he is reportedly paid for doing it.

On Saturday, March 20, 1993, the day before Mother\u0027s Day, an IRA bomb exploded without warning in a rubbish bin in Warrington\u0027s Bridge Street shopping area. Three-year-old Jonathan Ball was killed instantaneously. Moments later a second bomb exploded, seriously injuring 50 people and claiming the life of another child, 12-year-old Tim Parry, who died in hospital five days later after his parents, Colin and Wendy, had to take the unimaginable step of turning off his life-support machine. The reaction worldwide to what happened in Warrington was one of revulsion and locally anger was directed at the Irish community. Across the Irish Sea, however, the anger manifested itself into something unexpected and uplifting and it forms the basis of a new BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day.  The killing of the two innocent boys was a step to far for many who by their silence had supported the armed struggle. At the time Susan McHugh, then 37, was an ordinary wife and mother living in Clontarf, Dublin. After hearing of the Warrington tragedy, she said she felt the impulse to pick up the phone to book a hall at Trinity College, Dublin and later announced on the radio phone-in Liveline the holding of a protest meeting. She voiced her indignation as an Irish citizen about what had been committed in her name She asked people to join her at a public meeting at TCD on March 24 - 1,000 attended.  Her rallying speech At the time, the mum of two said: The IRA did not kill Johnathan Ball in my name or in your name. I want to tell the world tonight they did not kill him in the name of Ireland. There\u0027s nothing wrong with being emotional about a little baby\u0027s death. I feel horror, revulsion and sadness. But that\u0027s not enough. Tonight I feel anger. I feel angry and frustrated because the political will is not there to end the violence. We\u0027ve listened too long to rhetoric with no results. Sincere people will say everything has been tried. Maybe it\u0027s time it was looked at from a different angle.  Maybe it\u0027s time we asked for UN troops and independent arbitrators from Europe or the outside world. She appealed to politicians of all parties on both sides of the border. \u0027\u0027We demand an immediate peace plan . . . tonight is a night to remember,\u0027\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027We, the silent majority, say enough is enough.\u0027\u0027 The peace rally A peace rally in O\u0027Connell Street followed, attended by 20,000 people. It was a pivotal moment the launch of the Peace Consensus and a demonstration of people power, as journalist Bernie Ni Fhlatharta put it, that would do something the politicians had failed to do: kick-start the peace process and ultimately remake the political landscape of Northern Ireland. Across the country scores of people signed books of condolence in churches around Ireland and thousands of bouquets of flowers were transported by the Irish Air Corps to the funeral of Jonathan Ball. At one rally McHugh shouted: Please, please, please, make it stop! She was cheered by grim-faced people standing near the post office in the rain, many wearing white ribbons for peace.  Enough is enough In an interview before the demonstration she said: I\u0027m only saying what the majority of people in the country say. Enough is enough. We don\u0027t want any more deaths. We want a cease-fire. At the time she was lionized by the media as the leader of a new peace movement, but she insisted: I\u0027m an ordinary mum, a housewife. It was a dramatic time as the world searched for an end to violence and is seen by some as the moment peace seemed within reach. A year later the IRA announced a ceasefire, it was not to last, but it was the beginning of the end. Is Mother\u0027s Day true?  Now a BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day will tell the story of McHugh, played by Vicky McClure (Line of Duty, The Replacement) and Wendy Parry, played by Anna Maxwell Martin (Motherland, Good Omens) the mother of 12 year old Tim Parry who lost his life in the attack.

Beth Fitzsimmons was on the Greek island of Zante when she and eight pals decided to get the words \u0027shalom Jackie\u0027 written on their arms. But the henna tattoo - which cost five euros - left her with a burning sensation on her arms, and could now take six months to heal. The 19-year-old had an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the black henna, which can contain high levels of toxic chemical paraphenylenediamine (PPD). She chose the words \u0027shalom Jackie\u0027 because people on the holiday kept shouting it and she and her friends found it amusing.  Despite worrying her parents, Beth says nothing was wrong with the tattoo until the eight day, when it started itching and she had a burning sensation. Beth, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: It was one of those phrases that people were just shouting. My friends and I thought it was really funny so on the third night of the holiday after going out we decided to get it done. We were on a night out but I don\u0027t really drink so I was sober when I did it.  It was done by a random family in the street. The mum and dad were doing them. We woke up the next day and thought it was hilarious. We sent pictures to our parents and and they were like \u0027that better not be permanent\u0027. It was absolutely fine until about eight days later then it was so itchy and it felt like it was burning. It was so red. It was all raised up. Now it looks a bit like eczema and is very dry.  I went to the pharmacy about a week after I got back home and they didn\u0027t have a clue. That was on a Thursday and they said if it was still there on Sunday go to the walk-in centre. I thought that was a bit extreme so I went to the doctor on the Monday. I said to them that I was probably overreacting but I needed to know if it was going to scar permanently because when I looked it up it said you needed to be treated for chemical burns. I was so worried it would scar me forever. The para-phenylenediamine chemical in black henna is also used in hair dyes and not in brown or other coloured henna. It can cause blistering of the skin, painful burns and can lead to scarring as well as leaving someone with a lifelong sensitivity to it which increases the risk of severe allergic reaction when using hair dyes in the future. When she returned to the pharmacist to collect her prescription, Beth was warned because of the chemical she would no longer be able to dye her hair.

The pensioner, who suffers from mobility issues, says her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. Retired care assistant Freda said: The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude. One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?  Freda had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says the travel operator Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda, who lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish.  My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.

The 47-year-old has suffered from a number of health issues, and had tests after suffering what was thought to be a chest infection in December. But it turned out to be lung cancer and Andy quickly underwent an aggressive course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, reports Coventry Live . Though recently it was discovered that the cancer had left Andy\u0027s lung, it had sadly spread to his liver and spine - and he was given just weeks to live. Sharon and Andy were planning on getting married next year, when Andy was better. But with the tragic news, they have had to have a rethink. And the couple, who have two young children, are trying to organise a wedding - in just one week\u0027s time.  On August 20, the couple are set to tie the knot, but they need some help to make the day extra special. Sharon said: We\u0027re getting married at Coventry Registry Office, and we\u0027re having the reception at Wyken Working Men\u0027s Club. We were going to get married next year when Andy was better, but that changed when he was given about two months to live. So we\u0027re trying to raise money now to make the day extra special, to hire a DJ, get some flowers, that sort of thing. We have also set up a fundraiser for our reception and honeymoon in the UK. Sharon set up a fundraiser on Facebook, with the hope of raising \u0026pound1,000. Remarkably, in just seven days, she has raised \u0026pound2,090.

Sion Monty, 30, who owns a gym, was mortified to discover he had hit 16 stone in just six months. But with his business reputation on the line and wanting to ensure he was a healthy parent to his son Tedi, he ditched the weight with the help of his new tot. Sion, who also has his own gym clothing line and supplement range vowed to lose weight after he hit 16 stone by doing daily runs, hill sprints and long walks with Tedi in his pram.  \u2028But thanks to a diet overhaul and exercising six days-a-week, he lost nearly four stone, buffed up and got super fit for his little lad and proud partner Kara Williams, 27. \u2028Now body-confident Sion - who used to refuse to take off his jumper in the gym - is competing in competitions and inspiring other \u0027dad bods\u0027 on social media. \u2028Sion, from Porthmadog, Wales, said: I didn\u0027t want to be a fat dad. I looked in the mirror and realised that if I wanted to live a long life and see my son live his life I needed to change. \u2028I was so body conscious and maybe a bit embarrassed because I was known as a fit guy. \u2028I knew I had to involve Tedi in getting fit if I was going to fit it in, while spending time with him. \u2028You should have seen how much he laughed at his dad jogging up the hills. \u2028He loves birds, so I would choose walks and runs where he there were lots of birds for us to spot together. \u2028My exercise had dropped off because I just didn\u0027t have time to spent that time away from the family. But the key was involving them in it.  Sion first piled on the pounds during his first year at university, going from 12st 7lb to 15st 7lb in 2011. \u2028He said the wake up call was being called fat by friends at home and he lost all the weight in one summer. \u2028His partner Kara, an administrator, had their son in July 2017, and being a dad zapped his energy, and he started have takeaways up to five times a week. \u2028Before my son arrived it was my girlfriend, work and the gym - that was it, he said. \u2028I ate quite well and enjoyed the odd takeaway at the weekend. I totally underestimated how much having a child actually takes over your life. \u2028My family came first, then my businesses and soon going to the gym and fitness went out the back door. \u2028My baby suffered with reflux, he never slept, we were always tired, we didn\u0027t have any time for cooking, and it was really hard work.

Stomach churning photographs show the extent of the disrepair of the property in Exmouth piled with rubbish and cigarette butts. Now the family who recently inherited the property from the late landlord have hit out at the council for its lack of help.  The family were gobsmacked to discover conditions lived in by a tenant not paying his bills, reports Devon Live .  But, because they didn\u0027t go through legal channels to serve the man a written notice, East Devon District Council say he is allowed to remain.  Adding insult to injury, an order has been slapped on the family telling them to fork out and make it habitable before being able to formally re-let. The partner of one of the landlords has spoken of his complete disgust at both the state of the annex and the council\u0027s lack of help. On the list of damaged items in the flat includes its electrics - entirely torn out. So littered with bottles of urine and used needles, an electrician called in to repair it completely refused to enter for their own safety.  He reportedly added that he \u0027did not know what he would catch.\u0027 The tenant was served, in writing, with four week\u0027s notice because he had not been paying his rent, explained the partner. Because it was not done legally, the council is insisting he comes back. We have to foot the bill as he moves back in. It attracts all sorts of junkies and we have had to set up cameras, as the landlords\u0027 home shares an entrance to the annex.

For the third Sunday running, Northern Rail cancelled dozens of scheduled services as new timetable disruptions persist. That’s the “new” timetable introduced back in May. Fares increases are about to be announced, while customer satisfaction goes the other way. Research has found the rail companies are the least trusted of 13 consumer industries except car dealers, due to problems with train punctuality and reliability. How did an industry once so admired hit the buffers so hard?  For once Margaret Thatcher is not to blame. One of the few good things the ex-PM ever did was NOT privatising the railways. It was, she realised, a bad idea as rail would always need plenty of government subsidy – and was a beloved part of Britain’s heritage. British Rail had got rid of its old-fashioned image by replacing steam trains with sleek InterCity diesel and electric ones that ran at 125mph and were the focus of one of the 1980s’ best ad campaigns: “Let the train take the strain.” Her successor John Major, though, was too weak to stop his right-wingers pushing through plans to sell off the railways. So the idea became a key part of his 1992 manifesto for an election he was not expected to win. When the Tories did in fact retain power he let the ideologues create the most damaging model of privatisation. Major liked the romantic idea of recreating the big four rail companies, based around regions such as Great Western and Southern, which existed from 1923 until nationalisation in 1948.  It was a sensible notion, as it would have created proper rail firms. Instead, he was again pushed by his more ideological ministers into creating a model that involved breaking up the railways into more than 100 organisations and selling as many as possible. Wide expertise was lost in this scorched earth policy. Track and infrastructure were hived off as a separate company, Railtrack. This was subsequently flogged off but went bust and had to be rescued by the Government. Operations were split between 25 firms, many of which also went bust and had to be saved by the state. The engineering department was split into 13 companies. Again several collapsed – most recently Carillion, which had to be rescued by Network Rail. BR’s well-regarded research unit was disbanded and its coachworks mostly closed. We have ever since suffered from the consequences of that disastrous decision, which lies at the root of today’s troubles. Take the recent chaos on timetables. NR draws these up on the basis of demands by the train operators, which have contracts with government to run particular services. However, no one bothered to check if there was enough space on the tracks to accommodate all the extra trains that the operators wanted to run. Moreover, NR produced draft timetable plans late, so operators had no time to prepare for new schedules by, for example, training enough drivers. This was partly because NR’s regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, put the firm under pressure to cut back on the number of timetable staff, which the ORR felt were an unnecessary luxury. To worsen matters, NR failed to deliver some of the track improvements, particularly electrification, needed for the extra trains. This had a knock-on effect, as some of the old diesels used on these lines had been earmarked for other parts of the network. Moreover, in the rush to implement plans, drivers’ rosters were changed arbitrarily, with the result that they were in no mood to volunteer for Sunday shifts. At this point, enter Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. With so many organisations involved, he is the only person with power to ensure co-ordination between them. After all, the Government has a huge say on railways as it owns NR and determines franchise terms. So Grayling could have stopped the massive timetable changes of May 20 – but he did not. Later he said: “I do not run the railways.” Yet he makes many of the decisions that affect them and wants to take credit for improvements. He does not, however, want to take responsibility for things that have gone wrong.

We have asked the question and spoken to the club and I believe there is an agreement there but there is nothing agreed with him yet.”Ayr striker Shankland, who has started the season in scintillating form with nine goals in five games, has been linked with a move to Dundee in recent weeks.It was reported on Thursday that the newly-promoted Championship club had rejected a bid from an English side for their striker, but McCann, who has made it clear he is keen to add to his attacking options, played down his interest.“It’s really unfair to comment on any players I am after,” he said. “What I would say is that I have been in the market and been actively trying to get players.“Some have come close and fallen through, others not.“Lawrence is a very talented player.“I know him from my time at Dunfermline and have no doubt he could come to a club like Dundee and do very well, especially in the Premiership.“But as it stands there is nothing happening.”He added: “We tried to do some business on Thursday, it didn’t quite happen but we will continue working on that.”Dundee \u0026#8216agree deal\u0026#8217 for English attacker\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann on leeds united target steven caulker i thought we would lose him","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann was left relieved after managing to hold on to a couple of key players as the English transfer window shut on Thursday afternoon.Glen Kamara and Steven Caulker were both linked with a move down south \u0026#8211 with Leeds rumoured to be interested in the latter \u0026#8211 but remain with Dundee, and McCann says there were never any offers despite the reported interest.“There have been no official bids put on the table yet for Steven,” he said. “Clearly he is a player that attracts a lot of interest.“The good thing is, I thought he would probably go and we would lose him, but we still have him.“We need to be thankful for the squad we have just now, because we could have lost a few players to down south.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil rues missed chances in defeat by aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has admitted a failure to even go close with clear-cut chances cost Dundee dearly as they went down narrowly to Aberdeen on Saturday.The Dark Blues lost out to a late Gary Mackay-Steven penalty at Dens Park and, while he had no complaints about the decision, Neil was left frustrated as he saw three clear-cut opportunities squandered at the other end.Twice Sofien Moussa blasted the ball well over when given a sight of goal, while strike partner Jean Mendy fired wide.And if the other areas of their game earned praised from the manager, he knows misses like that have cost the team dearly in two defeats so far.That’s why he’s looking to add another striker to his squad and Shrewsbury front man Sam Jones watched the game from the main stand.A five-figure deal has been agreed with the Shrews and the 26-year-old will be signed up this week if he can agree personal terms.Addressing those misses first, Neil admits his front two should have done better.“When you create three, I would call them 100% chances through on goal, and you don’t work the goalkeeper once, that’s where you fall down,” he said. “It’s sore because outside the chances they don’t take, I think the forward work was exceptional. Moussa got absolutely battered at times but his hold up play was great. Mendy worked his socks off up there.“But you have to work the keeper and they know that. It’s not that I’m having a go at them, they understand that.“I do think we need help in that department. There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work. The guys just need to slow down, the most important thing they need to do is make the keeper make a save.”As for the goal that won the game, Neil conceded after initial doubts he agreed Bobby Madden’s call to award a penalty against Genseric Kusunga for handling a Niall McGinn corner was correct.“Just to address the penalty, I’ve seen it, it’s a penalty,” he added.“At the time I wasn’t sure. I went to Bobby to get his opinion on it at the end of the game and regardless of how close Gensi is, he felt it was a penalty. I’ve seen it now and I agree, his hand’s up there.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee council nets 9 94m in sell off of public land and buildings","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than 100 buildings and spaces in public ownership have been sold in Dundee in four years, earning the city council close to £10 million.A number of redundant plots of land and buildings have been sold to private developers for six-figure sums, including a development site at King’s Cross Road, which sold for £1m last year.The total amount gained from the 45 sales made since 2014-15 is £9.94m.Some properties, such as those that were derelict, or small unused areas of land, have been sold for as little as £1 to encourage development or allow for community ownership.Councillor Kevin Keenan, leader of Dundee Labour group, said: “These pieces of land, in my opinion, have been sold far too cheaply.”Some of the most valuable sales included Unit K and Unit A at Claverhouse Industrial Estate, which went for £780,000 and £575,000 respectively.John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said it was right for councils to sell assets if they aren’t being used.Bill Bowman, Scottish Conservative MSP for the north-east, said: “Dundee City Council has a duty to ensure best value for the taxpayer.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “The council operates a community asset transfer process, governed by the Community Empowerment Act, that encourages and enables the transfer of assets from Dundee City Council to certain community organisations.“If properties sold were part of the housing revenue account, any income received would be reinvested into council housing services.

suffered a reaction to the injury on the eve of the game in Paisley.It’s unclear yet just how long that will keep the central midfielder out for but he is a big doubt for today’s home clash with the Dons.Despite falling to a 2-1 defeat to the Buddies, the Dark Blues midfield didn’t miss Kamara’s presence too much with Lewis Spence an able deputy with Kharl Madianga, Elton Ngwatala and Paul McGowan ahead of him also performing well.And those four are expected to continue today from the start.Meanwhile, the English transfer window shutting yesterday evening was good news for Dundee fans with Kamara and Steven Caulker still at the club.Kamara had been linked with a move to newly- promoted Premier League side Wolves and Championship Swansea.Loan moves are still available to Football

league defeat that saw three goals conceded in the second half against Dunfermline last week, his desire to make changes is obvious.However, a number of factors, not least fitness, will come into play before he finalises his line-up.Stewart Murdoch could return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any reaction to the knock that’s sidelined him since last month’s defeat at Ross County, full-back Callum Booth will also return to the

factor in whether or not the pair are involved.Whoever he decides, or is able to use, Csaba will be looking for much better this time round.While injuries have ruled out various key players in the games so far, he believes those taking their places should be doing so with the aim of hanging on to them even if everyone is fit.“I have said to the team you cannot wait for Fraser Fyvie or Stewart

Outlander book and TV series.The A-listed building has also in the spotlight in recent months after forensic experts carried out tests on remains contained in a coffin in the crypt. Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things. There is a backlog of things which need to be done.\"The trust is raising the mausoleum\u0027 profile online and via social media thanks to the volunteer efforts of Mr Lundberg\u0027 student daughter who studies away from home.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Mr Lundberg believes much more could be done with the development of the website and an app.\"We really need to have better interpretation of the building,\" he said. \"At Culloden Battlefield, they have got display panels and we would like something similar for the mausoleum.\"He estimated the cost of renovation and improved interpretation would come to about \u0026pound100,000.\"It is going to need a serious fundraising exercise,\" he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe welcomed the recent award of \u0026pound36,000 from Highland Council for work in the graveyard including urgent repairs to structures such as perimeter walls and gravestones.It also includes the removal of several trees including six dead elms.

It’s a big safety hazard.“This has always been a problem at the supermarket, but there was an opportunity with these works to put it right and they have missed it.“When the work is finished, there will be 80 parking spaces taken out.“So there will be even more competition for the parking bays that aren’t too short.”Another shopper, who asked not to be named, said: “I try to park my van in these bays and it simply doesn’t fit.“You’re left in a situation where you’re putting your shopping away while cars are coming in and beeping at you. They really should be sorting this out, but they have somehow made it even worse by tarring the road and putting down new arrow signs.”An Asda spokesman said the store understood why drivers had raised the issue, which applies to “a small number” of bays on the car park.He encouraged people driving longer vehicles to choose other parking spaces and keep safety in mind.The spokesman added the car park has a number of bays for parents and for blue badge holders.The Evening Express revealed in May that fast food giant McDonald’s will occupy land on the site.Asda had submitted a planning application to Aberdeenshire Council for permission to demolish the existing five-pump petrol station and build a new one in its place in March.The petrol station is closed during the work and will be replaced with a new fuelling facility.Meanwhile, click-and-collect lockers will be introduced, for people who buy shopping online to pick up their purchases.Included in the proposals that were given the go-ahead was a two-storey drive-through restaurant.A McDonald’s spokeswoman had previously said the venue would create 65 full and part-time jobs.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/pj-jri-130818-05-003.jpg-870x564.jpg ","title":"council co leaders are blown away by 47m academy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new £47 million secondary school in Aberdeen opened its doors to give a first glimpse at the facilities pupils can look forward to at the start of the new term.Lochside Academy will serve the Torry, Kincorth, Cove and Nigg catchment areas and replaces the recently closed Torry and Kincorth academies.The new school will open to pupils for the first time next Thursday.Aberdeen City Council co-leaders Jenny Laing and Douglas Lumsden went on a tour of the new school along with educational operational delivery convener Councillor John Wheeler, and head teacher of the school Neil Hendry.Head teacher Mr Hendry said: “I’m most excited about getting the young people into the building and seeing them thrive using these incredible facilities.“It’s just a building at the moment and it doesn’t become a school until the young people arrive.“Next week is going to be a huge day for us when our state-of-the-art building welcomes our pupils and becomes a school.”The three-storey school will cater for up to 1,350 pupils of which 1,100 spots will be filled.Pupils will benefit from new facilities such as an incorporated dance studio, fitness suite, games hall, six-lane swimming pool, an adjacent garden and a 3G pitch.Mr Hendry said: “The staff have been involved right from the off and certainly as we have been finalising works, not just the teaching staff, but also the support staff.“We’ve been working hard behind the scenes to make sure that staff, pupils and parents feel welcome here from day one and ensure that we can live up to Lochside’s ambitions to inspire individuals and be outstanding together.”Some of the newest features the school offers are a special industrial room which gives students the space to fix cars, and a recording room equipped with Apple computers and 800 new Chromebooks.Mr Hendry added: “We’ve got 800 Chromebooks and nowadays, if you’re doing English or Maths, you can just get your Chromebook out.“All the young people can log onto them with their Google ID and have access to their Google Drive from there.“They’re great because once they’re charged, they last for the entire day. Our library have no desktops, but instead uses the Chromebooks so that there’s more flexibility.”Mr Lumsden said: “Lochside Academy is a marvellous testament to our £47m investment and you can see that every penny has been well spent on this fantastic school.“It really is a fantastic facility which has been built here and schools have changed a lot since I was in school in terms of the tech. We’re told there’s more than 1,000 PCs, which is fantastic.“Aberdeen City Council places enormous emphasis on education and providing the best facilities are a vital cog in our ambitions.”Mrs Laing said the councillors were “blown away” by the quality of the resources.She added: “The opening of Lochside Academy underlines this administration’s determination to continue to provide high-quality educational facilities for our young people right across Aberdeen.“The new school will not only serve pupils and staff but will be available for use by the wider community – and we are confident it will be seen as a welcome addition to existing facilities in the south of the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors aberdeen kids club is like a home from home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen out-of-school club has been praised for being like a home from home for children.Inspectors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Oldmachar Out of School Club, at Forehill Primary School, Bridge of Don, on July 16 and have now published their inspection report.They rated the club, which looks after up to 50 children at a time, “very good” for care, support, management and leadership – the second best of six possible ratings.“The club provided a welcoming, professional, yet home-from-home service for children and families,” said the report.It added: “Children and staff shared warm and respectful relationships and clearly enjoyed one another’s company.”One parent told inspectors: “I have two very happy children using this service.“My children are always happy to go and always annoyed if I collect them too early as they are busy playing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"japanese students visit rgu","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of 10 students will spend a month studying at an Aberdeen university as part of an international development programme.The students, from nine different universities in Japan, will spend four weeks in the north-east as part of the Nippon Foundation Ocean Innovation Consortium Summer School 2018.Modules will be led by Robert Gordon University (RGU) staff on marine engineering, oil and gas, and offshore renewables.The group will spend a day at the Equinor Hywind Offshore Wind Farm in Peterhead and go through an intensive three days offshore safety training.As part of the programme, the group will visit the Fettercairn Distillery and Dunnottar Castle.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soaked campbeltown cyclist raised charity cash","story":"\t\tMark DaveyUpdated: 08/08/18, 8:30 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Campbeltown cyclist joined an Argyll peloton for this year’s RideLondon 100 event.The eight-week London heat wave came to an abrupt end just in time for the cycling quartet to take to the roads.Campbeltown’s Marjorie Leighton had enthused so much after taking part last year, that she encouraged three Mid Argyll friend, Morag MacNicol, Catriona Crawford and Iain MacNicol, to participate in this year’s challenge.The day before the event the air temperature had soared to 32°C and the cyclists prepared for the possibilty of heat exhaustion.However on the day, they were shocked to find that they should have perhaps brought cyling capes instead.The persistent rain combined with the wind ensured that they were all soaked to the skin at the finish.The Argyll cyclists beat the target required for their chosen charity, Bloodwise (formerly Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research) which helps to fund research for specific types of cancer.This charity was selected, due to each of the participants having some experience with cancer.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"avenue arch improvement scheme to be re tendered","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project to improve the condition of Inveraray\u0026#8217s iconic 18th century arches looks to be making progress as bids to carry out the work are invited.But the Dalmally road archway, refurbished around five years ago but never re-painted, will not be part of the contract.This will be the second time the work has been put out to tender by Argyll and Bute Council.Speaking at last month\u0026#8217s annual general meeting of community development company Inspire Inveraray, council regeneration manager Audrey Martin said: \u0026#8216It has already been out to tender, but the bids were too dear.

Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety. The hotel\u0027s current owners, based in Malaysia, have so far failed to act on a Dangerous Building Notice served on the hotel in the Spring.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice.

At least that’s the view of four random people the Post spoke to in the town. But they want rules to ensure there aren’t trucks sitting in The Flushes car park 24/7. Ayrshire Roads Alliance are looking at a plan that would allow HGVs to park overnight. And Councillor Alec Clark supports the idea of trucks coming in from 6pm and leaving before 6am next day. But other voices in the town believe this could cause night-time noise for residents at the Hillcrest car home. And they fear excessive diesel fumes in the heart of the town.  Craig Galloway, 54, said: “Having the lorries going to The Flushes would free up the harbour area for cars and buses. And it would maybe stop them parking in the streets.” Mr Galloway added: “I think the lorries do bring a business benefit to the town, in terms of spending in shops and take-aways.” Nat Taylor, 64, thought: “The Flushes car park tends to empty at night, and the lorries are generally away first thing in the morning.” Mr Taylor added: “There’s really nowhere else that’s suitable. Ainslie car park (at the south end of the town) would only take about four HGVs.” Betty McQuiston, 76, has been involved with Girvan’s volunteer attractions committee for many years. She doesn’t want to see the town’s streets clogged up with heavy trucks. But she admitted: “ It’s a Catch 22 situation. We don’t necessarily want trucks overnight in the town - but they have to go somewhere.  “There’s already quite a lot parking in the streets, so having them at The Flushes would be better.” Mrs McQuiston added: “There’s no room at Ainslie car park, and the trucks have ripped up the surface at the harbour car park.” Scott Purdie, 49, believes a truck park could be created at Grangestone Industrial Estate. He said “It’s a big estate, with big areas of ground that could be used for overnight parking of trucks.” Mr Purdie added: “Big lorries don’t help tourism, but I can see the argument that they need somewhere to go. “However, 6pm is not late in the summer, and people in cars are sometimes frightened to park next to them. “I would fear The Flushes turning into a full-time lorry park, unless it’s properly regulated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"resident told how looked horror","story":"NewsResident told how she looked on in horror as drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at back court in Ayrshire streetMan taken away in hospital after alarm raised by concerned residentShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning11:00, 12 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA concerned resident told how she looked on in horror as a drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at a back court in Cumnock. The addict was spotted shooting up behind flats in the town’s Townhead Street. He was taken by ambulance to hospital after a worried neighbour contacted the police. The shocking incident was raised at Cumnock Community Council. Now there are fears that children playing in the back court could get injured if they picked up a discarded needle. One woman said: “There was a boy injecting himself for 20 minutes near trees at a back court. “There were needles lying about.” A police officer attended the community council meeting to give residents a report of crimes that had taken place in the past month. She vowed to take the matter up with the police inspector and urged residents with any concerns about drug abuse to contact police on 101. She added new community policing teams would be introduced across East Ayrshire in September and that more community officers would be seen out on the beat. She told the meeting that police had received 49 crime reports in Cumnock for the past month and 28 of them were detected. The majority of these crimes were theft by shoplifting and occurred at the town’s ASDA, according to the officer. She pointed out there had been a spate of opportunist house break-ins in the town but not in one particular street. One robbery and serious assault had taken place in Wylie Crescent and that had been detected, the officer added. Other crimes included breach of the peace and common assaults. Bob McCulloch, the council’s acting head of housing and communities, said: “Finding a discarded needle or syringe is undoubtedly worrying for members of the public. It is essential that such items are disposed of properly and safely to protect individuals and the wider community. “If needles or syringes are found in public areas, including roads, pavements, parks or public buildings, then individuals should phone 01563 554061 during working hours or 0345 724 0000 out with working hours. Please provide as much information as you can about the exact location of the items found to aid the disposal process. “In relation to private ground, the responsibility for disposal lies with the land owner. If you find a needle or syringe on your own property you should always exercise caution and follow advice regarding their safe removal. “Wear heavy duty gloves, use tongs or tweezers to pick up the item and put the item in a suitable container, like a metal tin, a hard plastic tub or empty water bottle, always with a lid. Cleansing Services at Western Road, Kilmarnock will dispose of the container safely for you please do not put it in your refuse bin. “Advice on reporting sharps finds and safe disposal advice can be found at - http://eac.eu/needles.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugs CrimeCumnockAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"vintage car same age owner","story":"NewsVintage motor is the same age as its ownerRetired bricklayer Rab is 62 and his Austin dates from 1956.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post10:47, 13 AUG 2018Updated10:51, 13 AUG 2018NewsRab Smith with his 50s classic Austin A30 (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHere’s a 50s classic that’s still looking great - an Austin A30 Seven four-door saloon, writes Edwin Lawrence. And this little beauty is the same age as Girvan owner Robert ‘Rab’ Smith. Retired bricklayer Rab is 62 and his Austin dates from 1956. “It’s quite a cute wee thing for its age,” said Rab of the British classic. The cars cost a mere \u0026pound507 when first launched in 1952. That was \u0026pound62 cheaper than main rival, the Morris Minor. Rab, who was also a retained firefighter for 26 years, loves a vintage car.  And he had a 1959 Austin A35, before acquiring the A30. The first owner of the new A30 in 1956 was James McCleary of Minnigaff, near Newton Stewart. Mr McCleary ran the car for years before it came into Ayrshire ownership in 1973 with first Frank Webster, then farmer Stanley Gray of Craigmalloch, Barr. Mr Gray also ran it for years, but by 1988 it was in total disrepair - and being used as a chicken coop. It was at this point that Hugh Sloan of Colmonell village came along to rescue the car. Mr Sloan took it to his workshop in Colmonell’s Main Street. And, in a labour of love, he performed a full restoration, including engine replacement and gearbox overhaul,  Hugh replaced the entire interior in 1981, re-chromed various features, and had the car re-sprayed ‘Rover Grey’. Rab said: “Hugh was totally dedicated to his car, and took it round local fetes and galas. “Sadly, he passed away in May this year when I acquired the car. “I hope to keep it in the best of condition for future generations to enjoy.” It is recorded that 223,264 Austin A30s were produced, but the survivors can now be measured in hundreds.

Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived.

Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey

research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat. For instance in Campbeltown Amelias, Food for Thought and Ceann Loch Diner are excluded.Neither of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s fish and chip shops are included, either in the listings or on the map, despite there being a map symbol for those takeaways.Many cyclists are inquisitive and will no doubt discover other options as the guide is just a starting point.The Caledonia Way may also appeal to motorised travellers as well as the self propelled.A separate concertina trip planner leaflet, inserted at the back of the book, shows a height cross section of the full route and is cross referenced to the accommodation providers.On the reverse of this route planner is a diagrammatic map, trip planning tool and mileage chart including a speech bubble stating: \u0026#8216Are there any more hills today.\u0026#8217The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Pete Martin and Janet Moss with their guidebook at the Campbeltown launch. 25_c31caledonia01_PeteMartin_Janet_Moss\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter safety first and cycling","story":"We totally agree with Jan McCorkindale’s  remarks regarding the  road signage and safety of cyclists on the A83 and all associated roads.Being regular users of these roads it is apparent that many cyclists refrain from wearing high visibility clothing and, also more significantly, do not use helmets for adults or children.As a sport cycling is becoming more popular.Perhaps cycling clubs and parents should be more vigilant to ensure use of these items before allowing anyone to use busy roads.Ann and Tom Campbell,Macharioch Shore and Motherwell.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish dunes club championship","story":"Gary Sheppard followed an opening round of 70 with a 72 on Sunday to defend the title he won in 2017, winning by four shots from David Lamont and five from Steven Gilmour.Steven had the best handicap total over the two days, with Neil Irving finishing runner-up in that section.A Mach Dunes spokesperson said: \u0026#8216Congratulations to all the winners, and many thanks to all the competitors for turning out to support this event.\u0026#8217Winner Gary Sheppard and runner-up David Lamont.

Visitor David Steel was two minutes behind on 28 minutes and there were eight riders in third place at about 29 minutes.One rider from Somerset, Frank Taylor, said: \u0026#8216I was born in Campbeltown but we moved away when I was seven.\u0026#8216I have been back every year since first with my parents and continued as an adult.\u0026#8216It is great to see the sporting opportunities available in Kintyre.\u0026#8217Mr Taylor said that he had ridden in many cycling club events but had never been to one so well organised.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"free tours roll out the cinemas red carpet","story":"Campbeltown Picture House is running free tours every Tuesday and Thursday in August, showcasing the revamped and expanded grade A listed building\u0026#8217s best features.Four volunteers are leading the tours, which begin at 10.30am and do not need to be booked, with those wishing to take part meeting at the cinema\u0026#8217s front desk.A Courier reporter joined 14 people of all ages \u0026#8211 and a dog \u0026#8211 on Tuesday\u0026#8217s tour, led by Geraldine Davey, and learned a few new things.The tour began by heading back outside to look at the exterior of the building, which was designed by Glasgow School of Art alumni and architect Albert Victor Gardner, at its original entrance.The tour continued into the cinema\u0026#8217s screen one, with its iconic two \u0026#8216wee hooses\u0026#8217 either side of the stage, one of which used to be a broom cupboard and the other allegedly the manager\u0026#8217s office.It was revealed that in 1960 it cost 3s to sit on the balcony and 1s 6d to sit in the stalls.People said that it was actually quite expensive at the time, with one commenting: \u0026#8216It cost a lot of pocket money to come to the cinema.\u0026#8217A few people tested the comfort of some of the 193 seats from French firm Quinette Gallay, with one gentleman who was reluctant to get up again commenting: \u0026#8216Just give me a shout when you\u0026#8217re leaving.\u0026#8217The tour continued upstairs to the balcony, where Mrs Davey pointed out the clouds painted on the roof, fitting in with the cinema\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216atmospheric\u0026#8217 status.\u0026#8216This is supposedly the closest we can get to the original,\u0026#8217 she said.She said that the cinema, once nicknamed the \u0026#8216flea pit\u0026#8217 due to its inferior stature compared to the Rex cinema, employed a pianist, Adam Ritchie Greig, when it first opened in 1913 to accompany the silent films.When \u0026#8216talkies\u0026#8217 started to become popular and his playing was no longer required, Mr Greig founded an orchestra which proved very popular for social events and functions.The tour continued into the new, second screen, which has 52 seats, with many comments on its intimate setting.The cinema operated continuously from when it first opened its doors until it closed in 2014, for three years, for £3.5 million of renovations.To find out even more take the next tours, on Tuesday August 14 and Thursday August 16, at 10.30am.Geraldine Davey, in the centre of the balcony of screen one, led her first tour of the cinema this week. 50_c32cinematours02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"costa del dalintober hosts campbeltown community regatta","story":"An active regatta sub committee of Kintyre Seasports Project met monthly  and twice in the month prior to the event.There was assistance from Jason McCallum at Keeping it Local, Krisp Print, Margaret Wallace TSI, Explore Campbeltown, Explore Kintyre and David McQuilken at Springbank.Sid Gallagher said: \u0026#8216Helen Gilchrist was a super master of ceremonies on the day.\u0026#8216Jamie McLean and Kenny Blair were power houses behind the Dalintober Beach Group organisation and contribution.\u0026#8216Jamie manually cleared half a ton of seaweed off the beach at 8am on Saturday morning.\u0026#8216The four RNLI crew members in the D-class lifeboat were on the water from 11am to 4pm despite a call out at 4am that morning and Campbeltown Coastguard also supported the event.\u0026#8217Groups involved were: Dalintober Beach group, Campbeltown Sailing Club with Guy Nicol on rescue boat, Campbeltown Sea Cadet Unit, Campbeltown Dive Group,  Campbeltown Stand Up Paddle Board group, Kintyre Canoe Club, Grant Logan Windsurfing, Kintyre Youth Cafe, Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Mr Gallagher added: \u0026#8216Campbeltown Sailing Club members Ian and Alison Paton and their two-year-old daughter Florence came up from York specially for the regatta.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy kerr open results","story":"Results: 1 A B Glendinning 85-18=67(BIH), 2 John Ramsay 86-19=67, 3 John Docherty 83-15=68 (BIH), 4 E White 81-13=68, 5 E Cappocci 76-6=70 (BIH).

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Our schools have improved their performance in SQA Higher Courses, with the pass rate at their highest in five years. And pass rates at grade A in Higher maths and English also at their highest level in five years.  \u0026ldquoThese are great results for our young people and they will really help to set them up for the next phase of their journeys.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Current and former Hong Kong leaders have criticised the FCC for hosting Mr Chan, whose party is facing a possible ban on national security grounds.  \u0026ldquoSadly, we are a nation that is quickly being annexed and destroyed by China, Mr Chan told the audience at the FCC event.  \u0026ldquoThe cry for Hong Kong independence is therefore a cry against colonial invasion.  The 75-year-old FCC has previously hosted politicians and newsmakers, including pro-Beijing speakers, at its iconic clubhouse in central Hong Kong.  It says it believes its members and the public have the right \u0026ldquoto hear the views of different sides in any debate.  The perception that Beijing is reneging on its promise and eroding Hong Kong\u0026rsquos free elections and freedom of speech is helping fuel a rising generation of young activists calling for greater autonomy, if not outright independence.  Huge pro-democracy protests erupted in 2014 in response to the decision by China\u0026rsquos ruling Communist Party to retain the right to effectively pre-screen candidates for Hong Kong\u0026rsquos leadership.  Hong Kong officials have dismissed the FCC\u0026rsquos argument that Mr Chan\u0026rsquos appearance amounts to a free speech matter, with the territory\u0026rsquos former chief executive CY Leung equating the FCC event with giving a platform to \u0026ldquocriminals and terrorists.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told reporters on Sunday that it was \u0026ldquoinappropriate for the FCC to host Chan and asked the organisation to respect that Hong Kong is an unalienable part of China."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8195472.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sponsored-content-seven-hidden-gems-in-inverclyde-and-renfrewshire","story":"  The Clyde is not the only thing these areas share, the current climate within Inverclyde and Renfrewshire is awash with new and exciting things to see and experience.

However the areas first ever Performing Classical Ballet Company was formed by Julie Gunn Kavanagh in 2011.  Alba Ballet was created to give students the opportunity to train and perform in full blown Classical Ballet Productions.\u0026nbsp Despite many in the industry saying it would be impossible to do, Julie forged ahead and put together the initial company of 33 talented dancers. Students were aged from 10 through to their early 20s, and came from Greater Glasgow, Ayrshire, Argyll and Inverclyde. Students trained every second Sunday and in 2014 they took the stage at The Beacon Arts Centre with their first ever production, The Nutcracker.    Julie explained that in the Ballet world students spend hours training and doing exams but do not get the opportunity to perform in a Classical Ballet Production. Yes they may do end year performances, but these are maybe 10 min slots rather than an hour and half production. It\u0026rsquos like training two nights a week at football but never taking part in a full game. Alba Ballet is the only Company in Scotland to give these talented dancers an opportunity like this.  The training is over and above normal Ballet classes, and Julie hopes that having the experience of these productions will help enhance the CVs of any Dancers as they look to further their career in the world of Ballet.  Following on from The Nutcracker, Alba produced Cinderella in 2016. Building on the success of The Nutcracker, Alba went on tour and after two performances at The Beacon, they took the production to Barrfields in Largs.    At the moment Alba are putting the final touches to their 2018 production of Coppelia. The cast is again 30 strong and this includes 9 original Alba members from 2014. Luckily they were able to put together a 10 min taster of Coppelia on at The Beacon in June, in front of two packed audiences at Julies Summer Show for her other RAD Ballet School \u0026ndash Elite Academy of Dance  Coppelia is on at The Beacon Arts Centre 2nd and 3rd of November and Barrfields in Largs on the 17th of November.\u0026nbsp It\u0026rsquos a must see for all Classical Ballet followers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Moving forward the company will be recruiting again for their 2020 production, so if anyone is interested in performing in a Classical Ballet- Alba Ballet just might be what you are looking for.  www.albaballet.scot  www.facebook/AlbaBalletCompany/?fref=mentions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \u0026nbspTonino\u0027s Pizzeria and Delicatessen  When you think of Italy, it\u0026rsquos easy to imagine the amazing pizza \u0026amp pasta dishes.\u0026nbsp So when customers have described Toninos as \u0026lsquoeven better than the real thing\u0026rsquo it\u0026rsquos because like so few Italian restaurants, Tonino\u0027s Pizzeria and Delicatessen is the real thing.

However, it is believed that the site dates back even further to prehistoric times when it was used as an ancient fort.  A team of archaeologists now hope to uncover the history of the landmark, which was demolished in 1677, in a ground-breaking project which will see its grounds excavated for the first time.  The project is the culmination of years of planning and fundraising by Professor Steve Mithen and his team at charity Islay Heritage, who hope to provide an insight into what life was like at the castle.  Mr Mithen said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely significant project for Scotland. We are excited about finding what secrets remain hidden underground about this iconic monument.  The archaeology expert added: \u0026ldquoOne of the main questions we want to answer is what the castle was used for. We know it was a naval fortress, but was it also used for entertainment, for example. Are we likely to find a great hall where they might have entertained other lords?  \u0026ldquoOr perhaps it was a commercial centre? Trade during the medieval period was hugely important so we could discover evidence of this.  \u0026ldquoWe also want to look at whether we can identify the destruction described in historical records. In the 16th century the Campbells bombarded the castle to defeat the MacDonalds, so we\u0026rsquoll be looking for evidence of that.  \u0026ldquoWhen you dig into the ground you never know what you\u0026rsquore going to find.  A team of around 40 experts, including leading archaeologists, geophysicists, scientists and environmentalists, will take part in the initial three-week excavation at the castle, which sits in Lagavulin Bay.  Mr Mithen believes they will be able to access underground structures and objects relatively easily as the site has not been developed in the way other historic sites have been.  The project will also see local schools and community groups invited to the site to see what has been discovered, and will be used to train current archaeology students in survey and excavation methods.  Mr Mithen said: \u0026ldquoWe really want people on Isla to take an interest in their heritage. It\u0026rsquos an archaeological project for all.  John Raven, of Historic Environment Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe warmly welcome this innovative project to raise money to support Islay Heritage and its aims of raising the profile and condition of, and increasing access to, Islay\u0026rsquos spectacular and unique archaeology, history and culture.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fantastic opportunity for heritage to make a greater contribution to the island\u0026rsquos economy.  \u0026ldquoDunyvaig Castle holds a deeply important place in Gaelic culture, and the excavations should help us better understand Medieval Gaelic culture and inform the castle\u0026rsquos conservation, so that it can be preserved and access opened up in the future.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot wait to see the results.  The project has been part-funded by the Lagavulin 200th Legacy fund, a scheme by the Diageo distillery to raise money for community projects through the sale of a special bottling of Lagavulin malt whisky.  Dr Nick Morgan, head of Whisky Outreach at Diageo, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking forward to seeing what interesting discoveries will be uncovered over the next few weeks.  Islay Heritage hope to raise further funds to allow excavation work to continue over the next five years."},{"url":null,"title":"cautious-scepticism-urged-over-e-cigarette-safety","story":"  A study, published in journal Thorax, found vapour may cause inflammation and impair the activity of alveolar macrophages, cells which remove potentially damaging dust particles, bacteria and allergens.  The researchers said some of the effects are similar to those seen in cigarette smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Professor David Thickett, lead author from the University of Birmingham, said: \"In terms of cancer causing molecules in cigarette smoke, as opposed to cigarette vapour, there are certainly reduced numbers of carcinogens.  \"They are safer in terms of cancer risk, but if you vape for 20 or 30 years and this can cause COPD, then that\u0027s something we need to know about.\"  He added: \"I don\u0027t believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than ordinary cigarettes.  \"But we should have a cautious scepticism that they are as safe as we are being led to believe.\"  Many studies have focused on the chemical make-up of e-cigarette liquid before it is vaped, the researchers said.  However, they developed a procedure to mimic vaping in the laboratory, testing the effect of e-cigarette vapour condensate on alveolar macrophages extracted from the lung tissue samples of eight non-smokers.  The condensate was found to be more harmful to the cells than plain e-cigarette fluid, and the effects worsened as the \"dose\" was increased.  The researchers said further work is needed to fully understand the effects of vapour exposure in humans, but added: \"We suggest continued caution against the widely held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe.\"  Commenting on the findings, Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, said: \"This study demonstrates evidence that lung cells exposed to electronic cigarette vapour become inflamed, as would be expected given that electronic cigarette vapour contains oxidant and other pro-inflammatory constituents.  \"This indicates that long-term use of electronic cigarettes is likely to have adverse effects, as is widely recognised by leading health authorities in the UK including the Royal College of Physicians and Public Health England.  \"However, since electronic cigarettes are used almost exclusively in the UK by current or former smokers, the key question is how this adverse effect compares with that of exposure to cigarette smoke.\"  He added: \"The harsh truth is that smoking kills, and smokers who switch completely to electronic cigarettes are likely to substantially reduce the likelihood of premature death and disability.\""},{"url":null,"title":"rail-fares-are-increasing-twice-as-fast-as-wages-new-analysis-shows","story":"  Research by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) found fares have risen by around 32 per cent in nine years compared with 16% for average weekly earnings.  It comes as campaigners, trade unions and politicians hit out at an anticipated 3.5% rise in ticket costs next year, which could see some passengers shelling out more than \u0026pound150 extra to get to work.  Bruce Williamson of transport campaign group Railfuture said: \u0026ldquoFor many people, the reality is that British rail transport is hideously expensive and set to get worse.  The latest increase will be confirmed when the July Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation is released by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow.  The Department for Transport (DfT) uses July\u0027s RPI to determine the annual increase in regulated train fares, which comes into force every January.  ScotRail\u0026rsquos peak fares increased by 3.6% at the start of this year, with the cost of off peak tickets rising by 2.6%. Elsewhere in the UK, all regulated fares increased by 3.6%.  Campaigners argue fare rises should be pegged to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), as it is generally lower than RPI. But the RMT said this would still have seen the cost of tickets increase 36% faster than wages over the same period.  It claimed commuters across the UK are being \"ripped off\", with train tickets \"massively\" more expensive than the rest of Europe.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos transport spokesman Colin Smyth branded the predicted fare hikes \u0026ldquototally unacceptable, insisting they show the \u0026ldquogreat train robbery facing Scotland\u0026rsquos rail passengers continues.  He said: \u0026ldquoScottish Labour research revealed that commuters were already paying up to a fifth of their wages on fares \u0026ndash and that is before another eye-watering hike.  RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said British rail fares are up to five times more expensive than elsewhere in Europe, adding: \u0026ldquoThat is nothing short of a scandal.  He said: \"Even if fares were pegged at the more modest CPI these latest increases would still massively outstrip wages leaving the British passenger to pay through the nose to travel on rammed out and unreliable services.  \"Meanwhile the rail companies, the majority of whom are foreign state-owned, are using the British transport system as a cash-cow to hold down their own domestic fares. That is a nonsense and must be stopped.  \"It is no wonder that passenger numbers are falling when they are paying more and more for less and less.  He insisted this \u0026ldquolatest kick in the teeth for passengers is another nail in the coffin for privatisation and it is now a question of when not if our railways are nationalised.\"  The Campaign for Better Transport, which promotes better bus and rail services, has urged the Government to \"commit to a fares freeze\" while services are improved. This was echoed by former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis.  Next year\u0026rsquos anticipated fare hike comes as research showed passenger satisfaction with rail punctuality and reliability has fallen in the last decade.  Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies, insisted 98p from every pound spent on train fares is invested back into the railways.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said ScotRail\u0026rsquos fare increases are lower on average than those elsewhere in the UK.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis is a result of our policy to place a cap that is lower than RPI on regulated off-peak fare increases, whereas the UK Government applies an increase at the level of RPI to all regulated fares.  \"Passengers make a contribution towards the cost of running the railway through rail fares, however, we meet the majority of the cost of rail passenger services in Scotland.  \"We have taken action to keep fares down: regulated ScotRail peak fares increases are capped at the level of the RPI and regulated off-peak fares at one per cent lower than inflation.  A DfT spokesman said: \"Any fare increase is unwelcome, but it is not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do.  \"Taxpayers already subsidise the network by more than \u0026pound4 billion a year \u0026ndash meaning that 38% of our transport budget is spent on the 2% of journeys that the railway accounts for.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8199666.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-ready-to-face-up-to-dark-past-of-henry-dundas-philanthropist-who-also-championed-slavery","story":"  Oxford University has refused to scrap a statue of arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes, while Bristol is renaming a hall named after slave trader Edward Colston. In the United States, such \u0026lsquoreverse airbrushing\u0026rsquo has seen New Orleans and other cities remove statues of Southern general Robert E. Lee and other confederate monuments.  Now Edinburgh is close to finding a solution to address the legacy of Henry Dundas. The first Viscount Melville (the title was created for him) is commemorated, by way of a statue which sits on top of a 150 foot pillar in St Andrews Square. But, despite his own controversial history, campaigners do not want the statue removed. Instead they want a plaque which describes him to give a fuller account of the role of the Scottish Conservative politician.  A low plaque currently informs visitors who search for it that he was a dominant figure in politics for more than 40 years. \u0026ldquo Besides being treasurer to the navy he was lord advocate \u0026amp keeper of the Scottish signet.  But Dundas was more than that, according to Adam Ramsay, co-editor of Open Democracy: Hewas an enthusiastic funder of slavery, who as home secretary sent troops to put down revolts against slavery and oppression. \u0026ldquoHe was directly responsible for the transportation of the Scottish Martyrs, Mr Ramsay says. As First Lord of the Admiralty he also had a pivotal role in the expansion of the British Empire:    Most significantly, he delayed the abolition of slavery, his gradualist approach allowing the practise to continue for 15 more years than it would otherwise have done, during which time an estimated 630,000 people were transported to Britain as slaves.  In 2016, Mr Ramsay petitioned Edinburgh City Council to find a way better reflect both sides of the Viscount\u0026rsquos legacy. A receptive council set up a panel to look at the issue and this is now close to a resolution.  \u0026ldquoWe all have different perspectives, but we have a proposed wording . The council are going to meet to discuss it and we expect a decision within the next few weeks, he add.  The eventual resolution could highlight the role of Scotland in the empire, he says. \u0026ldquoBroadly, while many English people look back on the empire as a brilliant thing, Scots have tended to view it as awful \u0026ndash but all the fault of the English. But huge numbers of Scottish people profited and still profit from Empire, including my own family. It is important we have a conversation about our role.  Another of the panellists, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, emeritus professor of brewing and distilling at Heriot Watt University, is equally adamant these questions need to be addressed. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down, he says. \u0026ldquoIt would be much better if the plaque explained more accurately what Hentry Dundas did. He used the law to take away people\u0026rsquos rights. It was self interest. It should be on his plaque. We are not asking for very much. I lecture around the country and people say to me \u0026lsquo why hasn\u0026rsquot anybody told us about this?\u0026rsquo  Bobby Melville, the 10th and current Viscount Melville once criticised proposals to change the plaque as \u0026ldquowrong in almost every particular. However he too is on the panel and has reportedly moderated his view. \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to hear about bad decisions that seemingly he decided to take, he now says of his ancestor. \u0026ldquoBut he also did a lot of good. I don\u0026rsquot think the evil dictator was the image people had when they named streets and drew portraits and put up statues to him, he adds.  Councillor Donald Wilson, Culture and Communities Convener at the City of Edinburgh Council, said a committee would consider the proposals: \u0026ldquoThe Melville Monument in St Andrew Square is a tribute to Henry Dundas, yet many people do not realise who he was.  \u0026ldquoIf we can make it clearer that the statue at the top is one of Henry Dundas \u0026ndash and perhaps help people learn more about who he was \u0026ndash then that is surely worthy of consideration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6231372.jpg?type=article-full","title":"german-supermarket-chains-better-than-british-at-displaying-scottish-lamb","story":"  National Farmers Union Scotland said that a shelf watch showed that Asda, The Co-operative and Waitrose were \"found wanting\" with no Scottish lamb available on shop aisles.

The shoppers counted over 2,500 packs of Scottish lamb, which has protected status under EU law, and identified which of the big supermarkets were sourcing the most Scottish and home-produced lamb.  But the NFUS said the results \"notably demonstrate\" that Asda continue to stock significant volumes (40%) of imported lamb, where many of its competitors have chosen to source Scottish and British lamb exclusively. It also found that no lamb was labelled as Scottish in the Co-operative and Waitrose.  The NFUS said the majority of lamb in the Tesco, Sainsbury\u0026rsquos, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi stores, however, was labelled as Scotch Lamb PGI (protected geographical indication), giving the farming sector \"reason to be encouraged\" despite the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit, the NFUS said.  They found that Marks and Spencer stocked 26% Scottish, while at Sainsbury\u0027s it was 56%, at Tesco it was 59% and at Morrisons it was 73%.    NFU Scotland\u0026rsquos livestock committee chairman Charlie Adam said they would be raising the issue of stocking Scottish lamb with Asda in the coming days.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese shelf watch results show that support for Scottish and UK lamb producers is strong from a number of retailers, providing confidence to the sector. Indeed, six out of the nine supermarket chains that we visited were stocking only lamb produced in Scotland or the UK.  \u0026ldquoWhile the majority of the lamb was home-produced it was disappointing to see that Asda, The Co-operative and Waitrose had no lamb labelled as Scottish available.  \"In particular ASDA is way off the mark with competitors \u0026ndash stocking hundreds of packs of imported lamb at a time when Scottish lamb producers are busy finishing their stock. \"    Last year, campaign group Keep Scotland the Brand was launched, prompted by the steady disappearance of the Saltire on Scottish-grown food, and its replacement by Union flag packaging.  The #KeepScotlandtheBrand movement has been growing after fed-up customer Ruth Watson began tweeting pictures of Scottish products in supermarkets packaged under a Union flag.  alkers, the Moray-based family producers of oatcakes, cakes and biscuits got support in the House of Commons in March in the wake of one row over Union Flag branding with some warning of a boycott.  Joint managing director Jim Walker said he was \"not ashamed\" to use Union Flag branding on what he described as a niche novelty products sold in London and abroad as gift items and insisted he and the company are \"proud to be Scottish\".  The executive which sells products in over 60 countries spoke out against those who were \"mis-calling\" his company last week and warned that boycotts \"kill Scottish jobs\".  The new NFUS results come a day before the Lairg store lamb sale, one of the largest one-day sales of sheep in Europe.  They showed that almost 45% of the lamb available was branded with the Scotch Lamb PGI, with an additional 44% labelled as British or Welsh.  Aimi McNeill of The Co-operative said that Scottish-sourced lamb would be branded British.  She said: \"Co-op own-brand fresh lamb is 100% British across our entire store estate and we are proud to support British and Scottish farmers.  \"All of our fresh own brand lamb is 100% British and labelled as such. We announced this policy last May as part of our commitment to British and Scottish agriculture.  \"Regional lamb lines mean Scottish lamb is stocked in our Scottish stores.\"  Waitrose and Asda were approached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"population-of-hares-down-to-only-1-of-level-recorded-60-years-ago","story":"  The Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology and the RSPB teamed up to study counts of the animals over several decades on moorland managed for red grouse shooting and nearby mountain land.  From 1954 to 1999, the mountain hare population on moorland sites decreased by almost five per cent every year, the study found, saying the long-term decline was likely to be due to land-use changes such as the loss of grouse moors to conifer forests.  However, from 1999 to 2017 the scale of the \u0026ldquosevere moorland declines increased to over 30% every year, leading to counts last year of less than one per cent of original levels in 1954, researchers said.  On higher, alpine sites, numbers of mountain hares fluctuated, but increased overall until 2007, and then declined, although not to the lows seen on the moorland sites, the study noted.  The report stated: \u0026ldquoThe study found long-term declines in mountain hare densities on moorland, but not alpine, sites in the core area of UK mountain hare distribution in the eastern Highlands of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThese moorland declines were faster after 1999 at a time when hare culling by grouse moor managers with the specific aim of tick and LIV control has become more frequent.  Gamekeepers and estate managers claim culls limit the spread of ticks, protect trees and safeguard fragile environments, and a policy of voluntary restraint is in place.  However, campaigners believe the practice is cruel and unnecessary. The research paper, being published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, stated: \u0026ldquoOn moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to \u0026lt1% of initial levels after 2008.  \u0026ldquoBefore 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999.  The findings were revealed after the annual grouse shooting season got under way yesterday.  Lead author of the study, Dr Adam Watson of the Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology, said: \u0026ldquoHaving counted mountain hares across the moors and high tops of the eastern Highlands since 1943, I find the decline in numbers of these beautiful animals both compelling and of great concern.  \u0026ldquoWe need the Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage to take action to help these iconic mammals of the hill \u0026ndash I hope they will listen to the voice of scientific research.  The RSPB said urgent action is needed to protect mountain hares.  Duncan Orr Ewing, head of species and land management at the charity in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe consider that large-scale population reduction culls are both illegal under EU law and unwarranted as a method for controlling grouse disease.  But the Scottish Moorland Group said the research was \u0026ldquoout of kilter with other respected studies and said RSPB Scotland was continuing \u0026ldquoits political campaigning against grouse moor management.  This view was supported by a spokesman for The Scottish Gamekeepers Association, who said: \u0026ldquoThis work is largely at odds with what is being seen on the ground in grouse moor areas, where hare numbers \u0026ndash in good breeding seasons \u0026ndash remain very, very high, sometimes reaching densities of up to 200 hares per sq km.  \u0026ldquoData held by GWCT shows the number of hares taken on grouse moors shows no overall discernible trend since 1954, despite the claims by those seeking to legislate against grouse shooting that culls have been escalated to protect grouse. The average annual hare cull of 25,000 represents only 7% of the estimated population.  \u0026ldquoWhilst on Scottish grouse moors hare numbers remain amongst the highest in Europe, we know there are campaigning wildlife charities, looking after hundreds of sites, with suitable habitat but no mountain hares at all. That revelation may shock and will become clearer to the public and government when the new counting methods are widely adopted, which is what the SGA is calling for.  Meanwhile, grouse shooting season has opened, but some estates in Scotland have cancelled shoots due to exceptional weather, the March cold spell and the dry summer, hitting breeding stock."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-considering-workplace-parking-levy","story":"  A committee will examine a workplace parking levy \"to set out the argument and rationale\" for the overhaul.

The row erupted after the Daily Mail published pictures of the Labour leader holding a wreath in the cemetery, which it said were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of Black September.  The Palestinian terrorist group killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Asked about the incident during a visit to Walsall on Monday, Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoA wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended conference to those that were killed in Paris in 1992.  \u0026ldquoI was present when it was laid.

The Government say the proposals will empower residents to hold their landlords to account and give them support to seek redress when things go wrong.  Mr Brokenshire said: \u0026ldquoProviding high quality and well managed social housing is a core priority for this Government.  \u0026ldquoOur green paper offers a landmark opportunity for major reform to improve fairness, quality and safety for residents living in social housing across the country.  \u0026ldquoRegardless of whether you own your home or rent, residents deserve security, dignity and the opportunities to build a better life.  The key proposals which form the foundation of the green paper include:  \u0026ndash Steps to speed up the complaints process, providing access to effective dispute resolution when something goes wrong and giving tenants more support in accessing the redress options available to them.  \u0026ndash New reforms to make it easier for tenants to progress into home ownership, such as allowing them to purchase as little as 1% of their property each year through the Government\u0026rsquos shared ownership programme.  \u0026ndash Strengthening the regulator of social housing so it can focus on issues that matter most to tenants and has \u0026ldquosharper teeth to intervene when needed, ensuring social homes are well managed and of decent quality.  \u0026ndash Allowing councils to continue to have choice over their use of fixed-term tenancies, enabling them to offer residents greater security in their homes.  \u0026ndash The introduction of performance indicators and new league tables, rebalancing the landlord/tenant relationship to hold bad practice to account and ensure residents are treated with dignity and respect.  In a separate move, to boost the number of Local Authority homes, a consultation into how councils spend the money from Right to Buy sales has also been launched.  This sets out proposals to make it easier for councils to replace properties sold under Right to Buy and build more affordable homes.  Responding to the announcements, Judith Blake, who is the Local Government Association\u0026rsquos housing spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoThis green paper is a step towards delivering more social homes but it is only a small step, compared with the huge and immediate need for more genuinely affordable homes.  \u0026ldquoThere is a desperate need to reverse the decline in council housing over the past few decades.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe Government must go beyond the limited measures announced so far, scrap the housing borrowing cap, and enable all councils, across the country, to borrow to build once more.  \u0026ldquoThis would trigger the renaissance in council house-building which will help people to access genuinely affordable housing.  Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the green paper was \u0026ldquopitiful, with nothing that \u0026ldquomeasures up to the scale of the housing crisis.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe number of new social rented homes is at a record low but there is no new money to increase supply, and ministers are still preventing local authorities run by all parties from building the council homes their communities need.  \u0026ldquoAfter eight years of failure on housing, ministers should back Labour\u0026rsquos long-term plan for a million new genuinely affordable homes over 10 years.

Scottish Conservative MSP Peter Chapman this week challenged First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell farmers if she is in favour of the restrictions planned for the route and urged her to support overturning the ban.                                                    His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point. However it has been suggested at the Turriff Show by MSPs present that if individual farmers believe they will be severely disadvantaged by not being able to access the new road and continue to use only the existing road network, that they make that case to Transport Scotland.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"relief map celebrates bond between scotland and poland","story":"        November 11 this year will be a poignant date for many people here in Scotland.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down. It keeps bursting and they keep fixing it. It\u0026rsquos a nuisance and it\u0026rsquos been happening more and more often over the last few years. We\u0026rsquore also very concerned if there is asbestos.\"Sally Shepherd, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said: \"It must be more cost-effective long-term to repair the main. We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 11:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The architect firm behind the \u0026#16316 billion expansion of Heathrow Airport is set to mastermind the long-term future of Edinburgh\u0026#8217s Waverley Station.                Edinburgh based consultants, Arup, will lead a group of highly experienced professionals in shaping a Masterplan for Scotland’s second busiest station, which welcomes 20 million passengers a year.            This include architects Grimshaw, the company in charge of building the third runway at London’s Heathrow Airport while also taking the lead in the refurbishment at London Bridge Station and designing a new terminal one at New York City’s Newark Airport.            Commuter numbers alone  are expected to rise by 114 per cent between 2012 and 2043.Owner and manager Network Rail will lead a group with the city council to investigate what impact this will have on the station and surrounding streets.It will draw up short, medium and long-term plans with fellow group members Transport Scotland, VisitScotland, Scottish Enterprise, Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce and neighbouring building owners.Alex Hynes, managing director of the ScotRail Alliance, said: “Such a steep increase [in passenger numbers] is a positive indicator of the railway’s economic influence on the city and a clear sign that further investment will be required. “We are creating additional rail provision within Waverley at present and will continue to seek new ways to create the best railway that Scotland has ever had.             “The Waverley Masterplan will help us to coordinate our approach and to tackle some of the issues that an increasingly busy Waverley Station raises.”The Waverley Masterplan follows in the footsteps of other successful joint initiatives undertaken in other major city centre stations including  Kings Cross/St. Pancras, Leeds and Birmingham New Street.Edinburgh-based firm Allan Murray Architects will join Grimshaw following its award-winning Boroughmuir High School design. Real estate experts JLL, cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald, heritage professionals Jura Consultants, and consultation specialists Streets UK will also be part of the team. Cllr Lesley Macinnes, convener of the transport and environment committee, said: “This Masterplan comes at a very significant time for the Capital as we work to create a city centre that truly has people at its heart.            “We will shortly be launching a major consultation on the Edinburgh City Centre Transformation, Low Emission Zones and City Mobility Plan, and this Waverley Masterplan forms an important part of that programme.”The masterplan is separate to work to make more space for trains, with extensions to three platforms already underway.Elliot Wishlade, project director for Arup said: “The Arup team is delighted to be working with the Masterplan steering group to create a vision and a plan which not only meets future travel needs but creates new and exciting facilities, spaces and infrastructure that will make this part of the city work better and be more enjoyable for everyone.“We are looking forward to receiving inputs through the study from a wide variety of rail users, user groups, interested parties and the public.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783068.1534161917!/image/image.jpg","title":"idyllic scottish island dubbed hawaii of the north offers beach house to new minister","story":"        It is the most westerly island of the Inner Hebrides, a remote community sometimes known as the \u0026#8220Hawaii of the north\u0026#8221 thanks to its white sand beaches and clear blue waters.                Now locals on Tiree are looking for a new minister to lead the Church of Scotland congregation on the island, which covers an area of 30 square miles.            While one of the Kirk’s more remote postings, whoever takes up the job will be able to enjoy living in a manse just yards from the beach as well as performing a prominent role in the tight-knit community, which has a Christian tradition dating back to the sixth century.            Jo Bennett, clerk of the congregation’s nominating committee, said: “People talk about Iona as a thin place – a place where the distance between heaven and earth collapses.  “I think Tiree has that too, but it’s also very much a working community - you get both aspects here.“A minister here has the chance to see the impact of the work they do and be the focal point for the community.”READ MORE: Message in a bottle sent from Iceland washes up on Tiree after a yearMr Bennett said the congregation was regularly boosted in the summer months by visitors from around the world.             “In Summer we get visitors from around the world but in winter it may be much smaller,” he added.“It’s always a mixture of people who visit regularly and people visiting for the first time.”The manse is situated outside the village of Scarinish, just yards from the sea and with views to the Treshnish Isles, Mull and Iona across the passage of Tiree.Although the church building only dates to 1902, Tiree has a long Christian tradition going back to St Columba and his companion Beithene, who was the abbot on the island in the sixth century.            The local population boasts the highest proportion of Gaelic speakers in the Inner Hebrides.An advert for the position states: “We seek a minister who finds that their heart resonates with this island and this community who can meet us where we are and help guide us towards where we should be who can “be Christ” in this place to people who need His love.“Tiree is not a place that allows for anything other than going ‘all in’.“People will know when you leave the Manse they’ll know where you’ve been visiting what you’ve been buying in the Co-op and when your cooker has stopped working.“But they will also wave and stop for a chat when they see you notice the work you put in to visiting and come by with food or invite you round for dinner when your cooker isn’t working.” "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782243.1533918106!/image/image.jpg","title":"interview rose mcgowan is out to expose the real hollywood","story":"        Rose McGowan, one of the first women to make public allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein, has become a lightning rod for the #MeToo movement. The writer and campaigner talks to Janet Christie about misogyny and movies ahead of her Edinburgh International Book Festival appearance                If there’s one word that sums up activist, former actor, director, author, model and singer, Rose McGowan, one of the first to publicly speak out against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, now accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 90 women, it’s ‘brave’. Brave, the title of her memoir and manifesto is a call to arms for us all to wake up to the misogyny of the entertainment industry and beyond, her bid to give voice to the victims of sexism and violence and to join her Rose Army of free thinkers striving to make things better and reclaim their lives.             Set for the Edinburgh International Book Festival, McGowan comes on the phone from London, excited about her appearance and keen to spread the word.            Raw and revealing, the book follows McGowan from a childhood growing up in the Children of God cult, to Hollywood and movies, through her relationships with rocker Marilyn Manson and director Robert Rodriguez, through her alleged attack by Weinstein and its aftermath, to her reawakening and speaking out. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: The shows that were inspired by #MeTooArticulate and intelligent, she responds to questions without equivocation. This Rose is attractive and friendly, yet she has thorns.“It’s about getting braver in our lives by at least 10 per cent – I think that’s a do-able number. We sweep things under the rug because we’re too scared to confront them, but I’m here to tell you if you just go through it, if you look at the wound you can clean it, don’t let it fester, let it heal then you can have a free life. But if you continually cover the sore and pretend it’s not there, it will eat away at you. Bravery isn’t just you being brave out in the world, it’s also with yourself.” In Brave, McGowan says the alleged attack by Weinstein happened in his hotel suite at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when she was invited there after a screening of her film Going All the Way. McGowan says he later contacted her but she rebuffed his advances and after accepting a payment of $100,000, which she says she took as an acknowledgment of what had taken place, she says she was blacklisted by Weinstein and her career sidelined.            She doesn’t name him in her book, she’s taken back control and won’t have “The Monster’s” name in it – today she calls him “that warthog from hell”. Of his refusal to acknowledge what she says happened, she says simply, “Of course. Which just makes you feel terrible. Every time his lawyers say ‘consensual’ it gives me a body flashback and makes me sick to my stomach, consensual my ass. Like I would ever let that warthog from hell touch me. I wish he would cease to exist. I just wish he was not on the planet anymore, just cease.”McGowan had always spoken about the alleged attack privately, but her battle against Hollywood became public when she discovered the power of Twitter in 2015. After receiving a casting note for an audition for an Adam Sandler film that suggested she wear a form fitting top, push up bra and show some cleavage, she rolled her eyes, posted it on Twitter and went to bed. In the morning she woke up to an internet storm of support, calling out Hollywood’s sexism.Did she think ‘oh brilliant’, or ‘oh no, what have I done?’She laughs, “Kind of both. At first I thought ‘oh no’, then I thought actually that’s brilliant, then I thought ‘oh no’ again. It’s very strange when things go viral and you’re in people’s heads, on their phones, it’s powerful and weird and nice being on the other side of it.”            Silenced in the world of Hollywood, the internet was an arena in which McGowan found her voice. “There was no way to speak out if someone was controlling the media and dominating it. But they can’t control the internet, you have your freedom and your access route.”So when Fox promoted the new X-Men film with an image of Jennifer Lawrence being strangled, she published online an open letter of objection, part of a backlash against the promotion that saw it withdrawn. Writing in her book she says, “I felt an obligation to be a voice for women, people who had suffered from violence.”• READ MORE: Chris McCall: Book Festival’s good-natured debate is antidote to TrumpBut why does McGowan think it’s on her to object, why does she have this strong sense of obligation?             “It sometimes feels like if I don’t, who else is going to? If not me, then who, and why not me? I have a special tool set. I’ve dealt with some of the big baddies and I’ve had a lot of hardship and I’ve battled through them and I’ve survived. And I know you can help others get to the other side. “I’ve always had a thing for justice, I don’t know what it is, I just don’t like seeing misjustice and I certainly don’t like predators.” McGowan spears Hollywood’s misogyny in Brave, pointing out that in 2016 only 23 per cent of speaking roles on screen were female, the majority in horror films. “And we know how they get treated,” she writes. Further, The Directors Guild of America is 96 per cent male, and has been since 1946, which McGowan argues means that for your entire life you have been fed a steady diet of largely male thought and bias about women. “Why is 96 per cent of our information, entertainment and philosophy coming from men?... Film and television is a white male’s playground and through their narrow vision comes the manipulated mirror you’re largely forced to see yourself in. If that’s not malewashing I don’t know what is.”With an online following calling out sexism, when people started talking about harassment by Trump in 2016, McGowan didn’t hesitate to join #whywomendontreport (their sexual assault) debate.  “Trump helped elucidate what sexism and racism are, filled it out in big burning block letters and people went ‘oh, that’s what this is’. Thanks Trump!” She laughs.McGowan says she is speaking up for people like her, the disenfranchised, the hurt, the lost, the lonely, the brave ones who choose to live their lives differently, see things differently and function in a society that doesn’t want them in their own way. “The Rose Army is an army of thought,” she says. “We stand for freedom of spirit and mind. We stand for dissent. We stand for equality and the right to have our lives be unencumbered by proscribed thoughts and traditional mores.” McGowan’s book festival appearance is tied to the theme of identity, and the idea of whether we choose our own identity or have one forced upon us.“I grew up in a really unusual way that led me to have my own identity and not be co-opted,” she says, “and then later as an actor I played multiple identities so identity has always been a really interesting idea for me.”Now 44, it was growing up among the Children of God in rural Tuscany in the Seventies that McGowan first learnt to retreat into her own head, rejecting the rules of the cult. Then later after the family escaped and returned to America, she was bounced among relatives, but found solace in reading, identifying with the persona of each book’s protagonist, a harbinger of her later career. “I used my training from books, absolutely, it’s the only acting training I’ve ever had,” she says. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: 18 must-see shows picked by The Scotsman’s criticsIf McGowan’s childhood reads as traumatic, she also manages to convey the pleasure she and the pack of cult children took in their Tuscan playground, the rows of marching cypresses and olive groves, despite often being hungry, confused and scared. And it was growing up in a cult that made her alert to the mechanics of control when she arrived in the US, then later in Hollywood.“When I came out of the Children of God everybody was saying how weird it was, how I lived and grew up, and I just thought ‘well, it’s weird how you live, you’re living under the same kind of dictates, you’re just not aware of it’. Everything was the same except bigger and more diluted. I thought ‘if you think you’re free, you’re not’. I was really shocked to find how the same belief systems being utilised, but a more internalised version.”After leaving home at 15, she headed to LA where she was discovered standing on a street corner and offered a part on a film, Paul Shore’s 1992 comedy Encino Man. To the hungry and homeless McGowan, it was a means of survival. “I was a journeyman actor, it was not my love, it was just something I happened to be good at.”Success followed with The Doom Generation and she made her breakthrough in horror flick Scream, then headlined in Going All the Way, Devil in the Flesh and Jawbreaker, yet by the end of the 1990s, according to McGowan because she was being sidelined, the big film roles had dried up. Switching to TV she was a lead in supernatural series Charmed from 2001-6, then in a return to film starred in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s double-feature film Grindhouse in 2007. Parts in Fifty Dead Men Walking, Conan and other films followed then in 2014 she realised an ambition and made her directorial debut with the critically acclaimed short film Dawn, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.Since Dawn McGowan’s time has been taken up with Brave and the creation of a multimedia album, Planet 9, released in January at the same time as the book.“I’m really excited about performing it at my first music festival in Norway in November,” she says. “Planet 9 is kind of the other side of the book, where you go once your brain has been changed. It’s a place I invented, then astronomers found a Planet 9 four years ago – I almost fell off my chair! So I started writing songs for this place, and music. It’s my sanity. My art projects are what has kept me sane, that and my therapy.”McGowan is also writing a second book, on the subject of trust, a behind the scenes story of her life as she set about telling her story, a time in which she says ex-Mossad agents hired by Weinstein to quash misconduct allegations, followed her. “What is trust, how do we do it? I had to learn how to trust, otherwise you’re never going to trust anybody again in your entire life.”Given her experiences, how many people does she trust in her life now?“I trust about seven people,” she says, “and then the rest of the world, I hope,” she laughs.Seven’s quite a lot, I tell her.“Yeah, I’m doing pretty good,” she laughs and reconsiders. “Maybe it’s about three or four.”Fighting the Hollywood machine would deplete your faith in human nature, not to mention your resources. Ask McGowan where she lives now, and she comes straight back with “Nowhere.“I don’t have a house. I sold it to pay legal bills, so now I just travel. I live in hotels, airbnbs, on friends’ couches. Fighting the machine is not cheap, and they’re trying to bankrupt me.” • READ MORE: Edinburgh book festival chief hits out at visa issues facing international writersAnother front in McGowan’s fight against misogyny comes in the shape of the face cream she has developed with her aunt. It sounds unlikely at first, why is she dabbling in face cream? Yet as she talks you see her logic. “I want to disrupt the beauty industry,” she says. This is the woman who back in 2015 cut off her “long, glossy Kardashian-esque hair. I thought I looked more like a blow-up sex doll… I had been turned into the ultimate fantasy f*** toy by the Hollywood machine. I was dying on the inside and embarrassed by what I looked like on the outside.” And shorn of her hair, the real McGowan came out fighting. “And everyone complains about unrealistic beauty standards, but nobody really looks at it from a class point of view. I think it’s deeply classist, that if you don’t want chemicals you have to pay $150. It’s all part of the bigger scheme, of the way they keep women down. You pay them less and charge them more.“I’ve found an amazing laboratory that’s not connected to the expensive companies, to make an amazing product, that’s natural, and unisex.”And because this is McGowan we’re talking about, it’s not just dewy skin she’s after, there’s a bigger goal. “Ten per cent of the income is going to a centre which will provide long-term care for victims of violence, and I want some day to start a spa staffed by domestic violence and human trafficking victims. When people’s finances and self-esteem have been torn apart, they have no idea how to operate in the world but we can set them up so they can train others. So it becomes kind of like a school, that’s the company I’m building,” she says.“I hope to keep changing the world and do good for others. And make great art.” And when she sees the lengths people have gone to to try and shut her up…...“they’re still going,” she says.But she’s still going too...“Yep.”...does she ever feel overwhelmed? “Sometimes I get overwhelmed... a little. But the only way to change things is to lift the blanket and shine a light on the darkness. My goal is to expose Hollywood for what it really is. I have a million more stories I could tell in this book, but I don’t have the energy to document all of the dickery.” She laughs, exasperated, but determined. “In the book I say I’m like a phoenix and with this book, I rose again.”• Rose McGowan with Afua Hirsch is at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Monday, Baillie Gifford Main Theatre, 3:15pm, £12, (£10).

The party says the move would support almost 50,000 jobs in Scotland and boost the proportion of homes available to poorer families.            The Scottish Government has set out plans to build at least 50,000 affordable homes by 2021.            Ministers say the target represents a 67 per cent increase in affordable housing supply, with 35,000 of the 50,000 to be available for social rent.Figures show 4,629 new build social rent homes were completed in 2017/18.READ MORE: Third of homes in Scotland fail to live up to expectationsHowever Labour says the rate of completion should be increased to reduce social housing waiting lists.The party said its goal to build 12,000 homes each year is a “long term target” which would be reviewed on the basis of need.            It estimates the annual cost at £1.7 billion in the first year, shared by government, councils, registered social landlords and other partners.Mr Leonard said: “A home should be a basic and fundamental human right.“That’s why a Scottish Labour government would ensure access to a safe, secure, habitable, home by aiming to build at least 12,000 homes for social rent every year.“Our society is deeply divided, with the richest 1 per cent in Scotland owning more personal wealth than the whole of the poorest 50 per cent.            “This is no time to tinker around the edges, not when so many people in Scotland are currently waiting for public housing.“Scotland’s housing crisis is a key reason for deepening poverty in Scotland. People can’t access social homes so find themselves in the under regulated private rented sector. We have to address it urgently.“When Labour was last in power we built 61,000 homes for social rent in Scotland - we desperately need that kind of ambition again.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

Watching the cosy Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing programme the other night, in which these national comedy treasures discuss and compare heart operations, I felt compelled to search the internet for a previous Fast Show character whose name I couldn’t remember.            Eventually, I managed to track down Indecisive Dave, played by Whitehouse in the early 90s.            The nub of these sketches is based on a guy who offers an opinion on something, say the England football team or crime, then changes his mind as soon as someone challenges him.It’s clear that Dave doesn’t really have strong opinions on anything and is just trying to keep his end up in the pub chat stakes with his mates – who are more decisive than him. Dave would probably fall into the ‘don’t know’ camp when it comes to things like referendums and voting at elections.The don’t knows are a group of people who have reached a certain stage in life where they’re happy to admit that they don’t know all or any of the answers.No less a figure than Socrates – the ancient Greek philosopher, not the Brazilian footballer who ended up playing for Garforth Town – was also big on the don’t knows.Quoted by Plato, he says: “I do not think that a thing could be such an evil for a man, as much as having a false opinion concerning the things about which our discussion is about.”            I would put myself firmly in the don’t-know camp on a range of issues, chief among them: how to solve the Israel/Palestine conflict, what a post-Brexit UK should look like, should Scotland be independent, why don’t we just use the Forth Road Bridge during roadworks, and will Rangers finish second in the Scottish Premiership this season. READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Age of Uncertainty may see SNP wipeout or a new TrumpIt’s liberating to admit you don’t know something, especially in an age when polarisation is taking place to the right and left of politics in the UK, Europe and the United States.The rise of the Scottish Twitterati has seen a host of commentators crawling out the woodwork. These bright, young (annoying) things will give a strong opinion on anything at a moment’s notice as soon as the BBC call. No sitting on the fence, no room for discussion or subtle nuance – no, in they jump, giving it the full Katie Hopkins before taking to Twitter to signpost their latest musings.             Being Scottish in this day and age calls for taking sides and shouting loudly – we don’t really do discussions, only arguments and fence-sitters need not apply.I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time arguing in pubs about subjects as diverse as: are tennis players fitter than footballers, who would win if Muhammad Ali fought Mike Tyson, is Easter Road Stadium in Leith, and could Rocky take the Terminator in a square go?As the pints flow, the voices rise to a crescendo nobody is listening to anyone else and whoever shouts the loudest is deemed the winner – it’s great fun but does little to increase understanding. It seems that this culture has taken over in Scottish society. Like most sons, I always ask my father for advice, probably too much. Only last week, I phoned him to ask what I thought about Jeremy Corbyn. This has led to me being mercilessly ribbed by mates who stick the “my dad says” label on any opinion I happen to give. Asking your dad is, for the most part, a good idea – unless your dad’s a serial killer or someone like Joseph Stalin, if that’s the case it would probably be better to ask your mum.             Clearly there are some things that nobody knows, but this doesn’t deter the foolhardy.Sports journalism, in particular, is one area where any amount of daft questions are permitted.“Do you think team X or player Y can win the league, match, cup, whatever?” is standard practice for your average hack. Of course, the real answer is almost always “don’t know” as the event hasn’t taken place. The late, great Celtic manager Jock Stein understood this more than most when he proclaimed: “Only a fool would try to predict the score in an Old Firm game.”READ MORE: Socrates has the answer to Scotland’s problemsBookies exist because we think we know something when we don’t. How many times did you hear someone proclaim, “I fancy Tiger Woods for the Open” last month or any other golfer for that matter. All well and good but there were 155 other competitors in that event.So, who is going to stand up for the don’t knows? Sir Vince Cable is being touted as starting an anti-Brexit Centrist Party but he’s an unlikely knight in shining armour, although he doesn’t seem to know much so that would probably make him an ideal candidate.It would be a good idea to have another political party at some point with a nice centrist position kind of like New Labour – before Tony Blair decided he was in the SAS. They could certainly sweep up the ‘don’t knows’ and provide a much-needed alternative.My message to everyone is give saying “don’t know” or “dinnae ken” a go.

Almost 70 per cent of Scots aged between 18 and 24 said they were not religious, while the figure for the nation as a whole is almost 60 per cent, a poll of more than 1,000 adults found.

The survey, carried out by polling company Survation on behalf of the Humanist Society Scotland (HSS), also found that the majority of people (51 per cent) do not believe in an afterlife.A similar proportion (53 per cent) said they never prayed, while 60 per cent said they never attended church outside of weddings, funerals and other special occasions.READ MORE: Insight: ‘Can you imagine the country without its Kirk?’The biggest religion in Scotland remains Christianity, with 37 per cent identifying as such.

In all cases, the majority of those questioned said they did not believe in concepts such as heaven, hell or a day of judgement.            More than two thirds (68 per cent) did not believe in hell, with a similar proportion stating they did not believe in divine miracles. Angels and evil spirits were also dismissed by 60 per cent and 65 per cent respectively.The study also uncovered significant regional variations in religious belief. The North East of Scotland contains the most non-religious people, at 66 per cent, while in Glasgow the majority was only 55 per cent.Glasgow also had the highest proportion of people who reported praying at least once a day (20 per cent), compared to just 11 per cent in the North East.Those from mid-Scotland and Fife were the least likely to attend church, with people from Glasgow most likely to attend at least once a week.            “These figures show how the majority of Scotland’s population do not identify with a religion nor believe in key aspects of spiritual belief,” said HSS chief executive Gordon MacRae.“While it is important to recognise that faith plays an important part in a minority of people’s lives, the majority do not.“By all measurements Scotland is no longer a faith based country – and has not been for some time.“This is important when it comes to the provision of public services for example, providers must ensure they recognise and meet the needs of everyone – religious or not.”A Church of Scotland spokesman said: “This poll shows that more than one in three Scots identify with being Christian.

Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

This keeps individuals on the right side of the wildlife protection laws, and helps ensure the best possible outcome for the kittens too.\"\nSWA project areas manager, Dr Roo Campbell, said: \"We are well into kitten season now and we have already had a number of inquiries relating to possible wildcats kittens, some in Badenoch and Strathspey.\n\"What we would say is that it is virtually impossible to tell whether kittens are tabby domestic cats or wildcat kitten at a young age.\n\"We wouldn\u0027t recommend making an assessment until around six months of age.\n\"A nursing mother wildcat will temporarily leave the kittens to go hunting and could be scared off by lots of human activity around the kittens.\"\nHe explained: \"When working with wild individuals held in captivity, we have the luxury of using the combined pelage (coat markings) and genetic scoring to assess whether an individual is a wildcat.\n\"If found in the wild, we would ensure that both tests are done before confirming whether they are wildcat kittens.\n\"Unfortunately, such is the poor status of the Scottish wildcat population, any kittens found are likely to be feral-hybrid cats than of wildcats.\n\"If suspected wildcat kittens are reported to SWA and they turn out to be wildcats then when it comes to returning these individuals to the wild it is important to ensure there exists a viable population in the same area and that risks such as hybridisation and disease have been mitigated against.\n\"In this context we would highlight that a suitable release location is one where there is a programme of trap neuter vaccinate and return of feral cats such as conducted by SWA.\"\nTuesday 14 Aug 2018 11:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116892.jpg","title":"Dual stretch of A9 is back in operation","story":"\u0026nbsp\nTHE dual carriageway on the new A9 stretch between Dalraddy and Aviemore has been re-opened to motorists after roadworks.\nThe timing of the works at the start of the summer was criticised by community and business leaders.\nThere were also claims that Transport Scotland had put off installing the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) cabling last year to allow them to open the dual \u0026ndash part of the \u0026pound3 billion flagship project \u0026ndash as pledged by the end of last summer.\nSeveral laybys still remain closed along the five mile stretch.\nThe road was reduced to single lanes in each direction with 50mph speed limits in place for most of the duration of the six weeks of the work.\nTourism leaders questioned why work could not have been done outwith the peak holiday season.\nTuesday 14 Aug 2018 11:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116982.jpg","title":"Roadmen kicking up a storm in Aviemore","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nBUSINESS operators on Aviemore\u0027s main street have expressed their anger after unannounced resurfacing roadworkers stated without warning.\nWith the wind whipping around, dust and dirt was soon getting everywhere while the businesses were going nowhere.\n\"It\u0027s a real pain,\" said caf\u0026eacute manager Kevin Grigsby, \"and what we can\u0027t take is the lack of concern that the roads department showed in all this.\"\nHe runs the award-winning Cobbs coffee shop on Grampian Road.\nMr Grigsby said: \"They just turned up on Tuesday morning and set up the resurfacing without giving us the slightest notification.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Wash and squash materials where possible to free up space.\n\nWhat can I not put in my green bin?\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPlastic bags, polystyrene, plastic wrappers (crisp bags, biscuit/sweet wrappers and bread bags) and nappies cannot be recycled and should be placed in your blue/black bin.\n\nWhat happens if I put the wrong materials in my green bin?\n\nIf you put the wrong materials in your green bin the waste collection crew will not be able to empty it. A yellow hanger will be placed on the handle of your green bin explaining the type of contamination present in the bin. You must remove the contamination from your bin before it will be emptied on your next collection day.\n\nWhen does my bin get collected?\n\nYou can check your collection day on the council website at www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk in the ‘Find my bin day’ section or by downloading the free Bin-ovation app. Bins should be presented at the kerbside with the lid closed by 7am on your collection day.\n\nWhere can I get more information about my green bin?\n\nFor a list of all materials accepted in your green bin you can consult the council website or the Bin-ovation app. Bin-ovation is free to download from The Google Play or Apple App store and gives information about all of your bins and collection days.

Then,  around 300 workers,   mostly women,  losing their jobs.\n\nThe Business Centre  wants to compile a multi-media history project, recording the workers’ experiences. They want people who worked there to join a reminiscence/oral history project to record what it was like in the factory during the 1950’s, 60’s and 70’s, and the impact its closure had.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “The intention would be for the former workers to meet on a regular basis over coming months and to talk and chat about their times in Mayfair. It will be very informal and a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We intend that the project will be very much led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places in the town as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair, which will not only include the video-recorded interviews but also old photo’s and other items.”\n\nAnyone interested in joining the project should contact Ursula Kearns at Mayfair by telephone on 028 38 391666 or email ursula@mayfairbusinesscentre\n\nThe Tyrone-based BEAM Creative Networks will help facilitate delivery of the project and provide video-recording, design and other support. The present Mayfair Business Centre was established in 1995 as a community-owned enterprise and officially opened in 1996. The Business Centre has gone through a number of phases of development in the intervening years.  It has proven to be a success with twenty-eight businesses occupying a total of 38 units in the Mayfair complex - around 48,000 sq ft of space.\n\nMatch-funding for this project has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8594231.1533722568!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster bank to hold local drop in clinics","story":"\nUlster Bank has appointed a new Community Banker in the Co.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brides wedding day overshadowed by late bus","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

how awful the bus was and how badly they were treated was the talk of the wedding and the day after,\" she told the Belfast .\n\nFriends and family waiting to travel to the wedding were left by the side of the road for almost an hour, when two minibuses eventually showed up, rather than the agreed 35-seater coach. \n\nThe 26-year-old bride phoned the company as she travelled to her wedding with her dad, and was told by an employee \"we\u0027re busy, don\u0027t be so cheeky\", and that the bus was on its way.\n\nThe minibuses arrived along with a mechanic, who claimed he had been sent by Allen\u0027s Tours \"just in case the bus breaks down on the way\", according to Ms Lamour. \n\nThe incident resulted in the wedding on July 29 being postponed by an hour and four guests missing the celebration altogether. \n\nBoth Catherine and Lynne repeatedly expressed their shock and disgust at the service given by Allen\u0027s Tours. \n\nLynne claims she has been \"passed from pillar to post\" when trying to discuss the matter with the owner.\n\n\"Even when on honeymoon the next week, I had to phone them every day and only on Sunday (August 12) did I finally get to speak to Ben (Allen), the owner\".\n\nThe frustrated bride said Ben responded asking: \"Did they make it from A to B?\" and \"if they didn\u0027t miss the wedding dinner then what is the problem?\" \n\nShe claims he then ended the call, and has been unable to get in contact with anyone since.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, Allen\u0027s Tours declined to address the issue of its service.\n\nLynne has since told the Belfast  that in her phone call she addressed the issue, saying: \"I paid you for a service that you failed to provide\" after being told the bus was on its way.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"listed status to be stamped on 140yearold","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Victorian-era postbox that has stood in Lurgan for nearly 140 years could receive listed status to ensure it is preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe postbox is located on Market Street in the Co Armagh town.\n\nIt is regarded as one of the oldest free-standing postboxes in Northern Ireland.\n\nListed status is more commonly associated with historical buildings, but according to the Department for Communities it can be bestowed on any man-made structure.\n\nThe bright red box is nestled at the front of the Mechanics Institute and is believed to originate from the late 1800s.\n\nThe VR symbols above the slit represent the name \u0027Victoria\u0027 and \u0027Regina\u0027, which is Latin for queen.\n\nIf the listed status is approved, it will mean that the postbox cannot be altered in any way.\n\nIn May, 20 postboxes were given listed status with locations spanning across the country.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: \"It (the postbox) is unusual as it is a design that was meant to be recessed within a wall, but for some reason was left fully exposed. \n\n\"We think there are only around 14 of these types in the whole of these islands.\n\n\"It was picked up by the Department for Communities as part of a systematic survey of historic buildings in Northern Ireland (Second Survey of Historic Buildings).\"\n\nA guidance document on the listing process for historic buildings and information on the survey is available on the department\u0027s website.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"These explain the history of the second survey, what listing means and the criteria for listing and the Principles of Conservation.\"\n\nThe first postboxes in Ireland were installed in 1855 in towns and cities including Belfast, Dublin and Ballymena. \n\nPostboxes in the Republic were changed from red to green when it became an independent country.\n\nSt George\u0027s Market and the art deco style Bank of Ireland building on Royal Avenue are among buildings in Belfast that have been listed.\n\nArmagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is expected to support the recommendation at its meeting later this month.\n\nThe department\u0027s final decision on whether the postbox will be listed isn\u0027t expected until the consultation process is finalised in September.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"streets of brandywell echo to sounds of kids having a ball in memory of derry city star ryan mcbride","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Brandywell was awash with colour as hundreds of young people remembered one of their own in a day of street football organised by the Ryan McBride Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe late Derry City captain passed away in March 2017 at his home in the area, where his contribution to football has never been forgotten.\n\nMcBride played 177 games for the Candystripes and wore the captain\u0027s armband on 57 occasions.\n\nYesterday his former team-mates joined family members for a day of fun and football - not just for the young people, but for every member of the local community.\n\nGareth McCay of the Ryan McBride Foundation and brother-in-law of the defender, said the \u0027Day For Ryan McBride\u0027 was one of the most significant events for the family.\n\nHe said: \"Ryan learned his football on the streets of the Brandywell, when it was allowed to play ball games on the streets.\n\n\"We wanted an event for the young people which would capture the way Ryan first played the game.\n\n\"The streets have all been closed off and there will be games of five-a-side, the way Ryan would have played.\n\n\"The whole idea of street football has been lost because there are so many places that have signs saying \u0027No ball games\u0027 or the children play football electronically on an Xbox, so this is a way of bringing it back to the way Ryan played the game.\n\n\"The Derry City team are here and the kids will get a chance to play knockout and penalty shoot-outs against them.\n\n\"We organised this for the first time last year and there was such a magnificent response to it, that we decided to extend it to include the whole community this year.\n\n\"There are bouncy castles, a music stage and a free barbecue, so there will be a bit of street party feel about it too.\n\n\"This is one of the most important days in the calender for Ryan\u0027s family because Ryan was a Brandywell man before he was a Derry man.\n\n\"He is still idolised in the Brandywell, which was shown by the massive mural they put up of him at the Long Tower.\"\n\nLater this year the results of a consultation process over the possibility of changing the name of the Brandywell Stadium to the Ryan McBride Stadium will be published.\n\nDerry and Strabane District Council, which owns the stadium, launched an online survey to give the public a say on whether the stadium name is changed from The Brandywell.\n\nAs part of this process an online poll was available from April until July to allow people to vote either yes or no on the renaming of the ground.\n\n\nThe family have previously stated their dislike of this process. \n\nRyan\u0027s sister Caitlin McBride said: \"Renaming the stadium in Ryan\u0027s memory has the support of the Brandywell residents and Derry City Football Club, but it seems this isn\u0027t enough for the council.\n\n\"It is a bit distasteful it is akin to a popularity contest for Ryan, who isn\u0027t here, and we are still mourning his loss.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"omagh bomb widower came close to taking his own life in aftermath","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n

I thought my daughter was buried underneath her because she had been standing with her mother when I left, I couldn’t find Tracy, I couldn’t find Shauna and I couldn’t find Paula.\n\n“I thought they were all gone.\n\n“When I lifted Mena’s arm and dropped it, I knew that was it, but the next time I ran back in again, Tracy was beside her mother on her knees, she’d been further down the shop and got knocked out, but someone had taken Shauna away to the hospital, and Paula was on down near the corner.\n\n“The one thing I will never ever get rid of, until the day I close my two eyes, was the smell, the smell of burning flesh and the cries of people in pain.\n\n“No human being should have to see that.\n\n“The chat about Catholic and Protestant, blood is all the one colour running down the street, and for what. Absolutely nothing.”\n\nMr Skelton said the next few days passed in the blur.\n\n“Four or five years after their mummy died, I wasn’t much of a father, and I feel regret about it now,” he said.\n\n“They tell you about counsellors, what a load of cobblers, we had nobody, when her remains went out the door and the door was locked, that was it.\n\n“The only ones I had was my mum and my dad. They were always there and only for them, my mum in particular, I wouldn’t be here today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmagh Bomb Memorial located on Market Street Omagh. The monument is sited on the spot were the car bomb exploded on 15 August 1998. The glass obelisk was the result of a design competition and was built in time for the 10th anniversary in 2008. The ‘heart’ within the obelisk is supposed to be illuminated by light reflected from the a system of mirrors within the memorial garden in Drumragh Avenue. PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

Hong Kong pro-independence activist has labelled Beijing’s rule as modern-day colonialism in a speech to foreign journalists that defied the Chinese government’s demand to cancel the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe government’s demand raised questions about Beijing’s growing influence in the former British colony, which was promised semi-autonomy and freedom of speech as part of the 1997 handover. \n\nThe Chinese government swiftly criticised the talk, saying that freedom of speech in Hong Kong does not extend to discussions of independence for the Chinese city, which it said was a threat to national security. \n\n“We express our indignation and condemn it,” the Chinese foreign ministry office said.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping and other officials have warned that separatist activity would not be tolerated.\n\nSmall groups of pro-Beijing and pro-democracy protesters gathered outside the Foreign Correspondents Club’s building in Hong Kong ahead of and during the speech by Andy Chan of the Hong Kong National Party. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pro-China protester outside the event (Vincent Yu/AP)\n\n\n\n\nSome pro-Beijing protesters carried banners saying “Hong Kong independence is poisonous”.\n\nCurrent and former Hong Kong leaders have criticised the FCC for hosting Mr Chan, whose party is facing a possible ban on national security grounds.\n\n“Sadly, we are a nation that is quickly being annexed and destroyed by China,” Mr Chan told the audience at the FCC event. \n\n“The cry for Hong Kong independence is therefore a cry against colonial invasion.”\n\nThe 75-year-old FCC has previously hosted politicians and newsmakers, including pro-Beijing speakers, at its iconic clubhouse in central Hong Kong. \n\nIt says it believes its members and the public have the right “to hear the views of different sides in any debate”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Chan speaks during a lunch at the Foreign Correspondents Club (Paul Yeung/AP)\n\n\n\n\nThe perception that Beijing is reneging on its promise and eroding Hong Kong’s free elections and freedom of speech is helping fuel a rising generation of young activists calling for greater autonomy, if not outright independence.\n\nHuge pro-democracy protests erupted in 2014 in response to the decision by China’s ruling Communist Party to retain the right to effectively pre-screen candidates for Hong Kong’s leadership.\n\nHong Kong officials have dismissed the FCC’s argument that Mr Chan’s appearance amounts to a free speech matter, with the territory’s former chief executive CY Leung equating the FCC event with giving a platform to “criminals and terrorists”.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam told reporters on Sunday that it was “inappropriate” for the FCC to host Chan and asked the organisation to respect that Hong Kong is an unalienable part of China.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"beyonce honours aretha franklin at detroit concert","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC |

We are aware that in the midst of the Decade of Commemorations (and indeed the eighteenth months of the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly) this is the 70th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the 20th Anniversary of the Belfast Agreement. We are aware too that in the context of deeply polarized global politics, creating a climate conducive to human rights is no easy task.\n\n“We hope that the programme has begun to address the malign legacy of the Troubles by recognizing that the Civil Rights movement has been an amalgam of the generational, class, gender and ideological struggles that continue to face issues such as spatial segregation, racism, sectarianism and challenges to the LGBT, travelling and migrant communities.\n\n “We want to move away from the adversarial debate of ‘them’ and ‘us’ by creating a dialogue of recognition and reciprocity. It is appropriate that we are bringing this together in Derry - the site of that historic event fifty years ago - a truly seminal moment in the struggle for civil rights.”\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk//resources/images/8155590.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"oswestry show 2018 ready for thousands of
