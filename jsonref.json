A little boy called Willem Fogle. He was my little son. Stillborn at 8 months. A little boy I never got to know. A little life that never got to live. A breath that was never exhaled.          Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds. She also posted a picture of Fogle (left) and his team          Fogle\u0027s climbing partner Victoria Pendleton (right) was forced to abandon the trek earlier this month on medical grounds\u0027His loss changed our lives and I think about him daily. Losing my little boy made me re-evaluate life. Not only do we hold our two beautiful children closer to us but it was a reminder to live life for the now. Don\u0027t waste it.\u0027 The trip was not without problems. He had to scale the final 2,700ft, known as the \u0027death zone\u0027, alone after his climbing partner, Pendleton, was forced to abandon the challenge.TV star Ben Fogle and ex-Olympian Victoria Pendleton start...TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympic cyclist Victoria...Share this articleThe Olympic cyclist began suffering from the effects of hypoxia - oxygen deficiency - at Camp 2, 6,400 metres above sea level, and required additional oxygen to alleviate her symptoms.The double gold Olympic cyclist cheered on the team lead by experienced mountaineer, Kentoon Cool, from the side lines and posted her congratulations online when they finished: \u0027Congratulations to @benfogle@kentoncool Mark @fishercreative and the team for reaching the summit of Mount Everest thanks to @anythingispossible.world in support of @britishredcross #believe #everest2018\u0027.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram.

To embrace everyday. To always smile. To be positive and to inspire. In some ways I am now living my life for two. \u0027Willem is always there. I think he is my guardian angel here. There is one particular star that shines brighter. It draws my attention. It reflects off the snow and ice. I feel so lucky. I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/23/4C561AA000000578-0-image-a-20_1526509297296.jpg","title":"Meghans lookalike best friend transformed TV star Princess flew Britain","story":"    Mulroney and Meghan Markle pictured together in Toronto. The pair met in the city not long after Meghan arrived to film SuitsShe is also credited by many as the brains behind Meghan’s transformation from television actress to polished princess in waiting. It is largely thanks to their flourishing friendship that American-born Meghan, who relocated to Canada while filming the television series Suits, found herself moving through the kind of high-powered social circles that ultimately led her to Harry’s side.Meghan and Jessica are now so close that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. Dark-haired elegant — and extremely well-married — Jessica could indeed pass as Meghan Mark II.Not for nothing is Mulroney known as the ‘Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’. Born into Canada’s wealthy Browns shoes dynasty, a family empire worth a reported £50 million, the privately educated heiress is married to Ben Mulroney, son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — and firm friends with the wife of the current one.      She apparently enjoys the kind of glamorous lifestyle that could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine, and is regarded as the closest thing to royalty in that country.Every facet of her enviable life is shared on the social media sharing site Instagram — from her three beautiful children, to her impressive exercise routine and elegant social life. And, of course, her friendship with Meghan.Certainly, it is hard to see how Harry’s fiancee would have made it into the Canadian A-list without this female powerhouse.They met in 2011, not long after Meghan arrived in Toronto where Suits was filmed.The Mail understands that Meghan initially employed Mulroney as a fashion stylist after she shot to fame as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane. The pair bonded over their love of yoga, dogs, expensive red wine, healthy eating, work-outs and charity work. What began as a professional relationship swiftly turned to a deep and lasting friendship.And before long, Meghan had adopted Mulroney’s sophisticated socialite style.It was under her guidance that, after meeting Prince Harry, Meghan swiftly ditched the racier ensembles she once delighted in wearing and embraced a sophisticated, pared-down chic.Out went the leather skirts and plunging necklines. In came elegant, to-the-knee shift dresses and crisp white shirts.Before too long, it was noted, the two women were wearing their long dark tresses in the same style and were often photographed sporting very similar outfits.When Meghan moved to the UK in the run-up to her engagement to Harry, it was Mulroney who helped her put together a wardrobe of clothes fit for royalty.          Mulroney is an Instagram addict, which she uses to chronicle every facet of her enviable lifeShe was also behind the white wrap coat, green shift dress and nude heels that Meghan wore when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace last autumn.It goes without saying, too, that the dress Meghan wears on Saturday has had the Mulroney seal of approval at every stage of its creation.She is thought to have flown to the UK from Canada at least three times in recent months to oversee key fittings. But, while Jessica is believed to have advised Meghan on everything from the dress to the flowers to the wedding lunch, her family’s invitation to Saturday’s Royal Wedding is about so much more than professional gratitude.The fact that her children, seven-year-old twins Brian and John and five-year-old daughter Ivy, will be among the ten page boys and flower girls who will follow Meghan as she walks up the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor at the weekend is testament to just how close the women have become.At a time when members of her own family, especially her embarrassingly loquacious half-sister Samantha Markle, have let Meghan down over and again, it is Mulroney who has stuck faithfully by her side.Donald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the Markle...Share this articleMeghan — ‘Aunty Meg’ to her friend’s three children — has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’. It was here that the earliest whispers about her burgeoning romance with Harry were shared.Here too, that the Prince and Meghan were able to spend time together away from the glare of publicity that would have undoubtedly blazed down upon them in the UK.But the two women could not have come from more different backgrounds. Meghan’s humble roots lie in Los Angeles where her father Thomas, a former lighting director, was declared bankrupt in 2016.Her mother Doria, who used to work for an airline, is now a yoga teacher and social worker. Her mother’s great-great-grandfather was a freed slave named Wisdom.Jessica, meanwhile, was privately educated at an exclusive girls’ school before going to McGill University where she studied industrial relations and economics.          Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney on holiday in Italy in 2016. Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getawayIn 2007, she married television presenter Benedict Mulroney, whose father Brian was Canada’s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993.Much of Jessica and Meghan’s friendship has been played out on social media.The early days of their friendship were recorded with plentiful snaps of a holiday in Italy they shared in the summer of 2016.It was clear to anyone who saw the Instagram photographs of the women sunbathing in their bikinis on the deck of a boat, or sipping Negroni cocktails by the pool, that they were inseparable.Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getaway.But, crucially, it was also largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, among them 42-year-old Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, a flamboyant former TV presenter, who is now better known as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Other friends of Mulroney’s who helped pave the road to Harry’s door include Markus Anderson, the suave party-loving business brains behind the opening of the Toronto branch of the ultra-fashionable private members club Soho House — of which Harry is also a member.If ever a sign was needed that Meghan had ‘made it’ in Canadian high society, it was surely the sight of her at the club’s pretty rooftop bar with Sophie Trudeau and Mulroney on a girls’ night out together in 2016.She and Harry are said to have been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend — whose identity they won’t reveal.Before news of the royal romance broke, Jessica and husband Ben, 41, had Meghan and Harry over for several cosy, discreet dinners where they could spend precious time together away from prying eyes. At the closing ceremony of Prince Harry’s Invictus Games last October, where he was seen kissing Meghan in public for the first time, Jessica was one of just two friends selected to join the actress in her private box.          It is largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, putting her on the road to meeting Prince Harry Once Meghan had been catapulted into the social stratosphere, Mulroney happily slipped into the role of Girl Friday, quietly advising and supporting her — but always remaining tight-lipped.The two women enjoyed a foretaste of royal bridal dress planning when Meghan turned to Mulroney for help choosing a wedding gown for her Suits character Rachel Zane — who was stood up at the altar by her on-screen fiance, Mike Ross.On that occasion, Meghan chose an Anne Barge Versailles dress from the Canadian bridal boutique which Mulroney represents as a PR.Mulroney posted a photograph of her friend wearing the dress with the the social media hashtag ‘princess goals’.Meghan, meanwhile, apparently returned the favour by name-dropping her friend during an interview about her on-screen wedding.‘I went through all the options with my dear friend Jessica Mulroney of Kleinfeld Hudson’s Bay in Canada,’ Meghan said.‘I put this one on and it just screamed “Rachel”. It is classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for.’As a bridal expert, of course, Mulroney’s closeness to Meghan and the royals will do her no professional harm.Jessica has, since 2013, done PR for the aforementioned Kleinfeld Bridal, an upmarket Toronto boutique, which as well as selling dreamy designer dresses worth thousands of pounds, also offers £200 lacy lingerie and £300 crystal-embellished headbands.In February this year, she set up an Instagram account devoted to ‘all things bridal and style’, on which she showcases her ideas for wedding day fashion, food and exotic honeymoons. She also posts photographs of grateful brides she’s rehearsed and styled for their big day.          Jessica Mulroney and her children. Meghan is ‘Aunty Meg’ to the children and has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’She’s also guest editor of Wedding Vacations magazine and makes regular appearances as a bridal expert on Canadian daytime TV.Given the attention Meghan’s clothing choices already get, a friend like Mulroney is valuable indeed. She rode to Meghan’s rescue when she was agonising over what to wear to Pippa Middleton’s wedding a year ago.Palace insiders say she wore a simple black dress for the evening do, which Jessica — demonstrating a keen awareness of royal protocol — recommended only after finding out the details of Kate’s outfit, thereby avoiding a clash with her future sister-in-law.‘Jessica is smart enough to know that, as well as making sure Meghan looks her best, they also need to be mindful about what Kate is wearing,’ a source said at the time.Yesterday afternoon, Jessica was spotted hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter Ivy, doing some last-minute shopping in Marks \u0026amp Spencer close to Kensington Palace where the family are thought to be staying.So how will you spot her among the congregation on Saturday? Easy. Look out for a woman with Meghan’s shiny dark hair, dewy skin and impeccable dress sense. That’ll be her."},{"url":null,"title":"National Lottery results Lotto draw Wednesday 16th May","story":"Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayWho is Nev Schulman?

I’d done a student film for her when we were in university together, so she gave him the film the next day.‘He called me and said, “You’re going to make money, and I want to take 10 per cent”. He was like, “I think you need to stay in LA.”‘Then you fast forward all these years of not working and trying to figure it out, and I’m just so grateful that all the stars came into alignment for Suits, because it’s changed my life.’It was after arriving in Toronto, and landing her role in Suits, that Meghan became close to co-star Sarah Rafferty, who plays Donna Paulsen in the show.

On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on Tuesday and has since landed in the UK where she is expected to give her daughter awayShe was driven to Heathrow\u0027s VIP Windsor suite, where Harry\u0027s assistant private secretary Amy Pickerill was waiting with an immigration officer. A member of staff from the private office carried her bags.Miss Ragland, described as a \u0027free spirit\u0027 by her daughter and \u0027amazing\u0027 by Harry, was taken to Kensington Palace where she will stay until Friday.She will not have long to shake off any effects of jet lag. It is thought she will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the next 24 hours.On the night before the wedding she and her daughter will move with the bridal party to historic Cliveden, a 25-minute drive from Windsor Castle.It is widely thought that should her former husband, with whom she is said to be \u0027barely on speaking terms\u0027, fail to show, it will be Miss Ragland who has the task of walking her daughter down the aisle. Some royal insiders have also questioned whether Prince Charles might step in to do the honours.  How Meghan Markle\u0027s estranged family have turned the wedding into a VERY colourful affair Tracey Dooley, 52The recovering alcoholic, who sells advertising was once married to Meghan\u0027s half brother, Thomas Markle Jr.She was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her sons Tyler and Thomas, and are in the UK to conduct a round of interviews - even though she hasn\u0027t seen Meghan for around 20 years. She is documenting her stay in London on a Facebook page \u0027Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles\u0027 where she has uploaded a selection of pictures of famous landmarks.

Applications to defer school entry for their four-year-old have increased by 84 per cent - suggesting it could soon become commonplace if the trend continuesAround one in ten - 11 per cent - of the councils surveyed said they agreed all requests for summer-born children to start reception a year later.Meanwhile 63 per cent said they do not approve all requests, but are more willing to allow this than they were previously.And 26 per cent said they only allow those with a very strong case to delay entry.A separate small-scale poll of around 161 parents who applied to delay found that nearly half had annual household incomes of £50,000 or more.And asked for their reasons for delaying a school start, the most common reason was whether parents felt their child was ready for school.Campaigners have argued that some summer-born children are not necessarily ready to start school when they have just turned four, while previous research has indicated that those born in the summer months may perform worse in assessments than their older, autumn-born classmates.There have also been concerns raised that some councils allow children to wait a year before starting school, but then are told they must join Year 1, missing out reception.In 2014, the DfE amended the admissions code to require admissions bodies to make decisions on whether to delay starting reception in the child’s best interests, including taking into account factors such as parents’ views.The following year, schools minister Nick Gibb wrote to councils saying that children should not be forced to join Year 1 if they wait to start school when they turn five.He argued that admissions rules needed to be changed to give summer-born youngsters the right to start in reception if they joined at this point."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/18/4C5D8D3C00000578-0-image-a-3_1526578572095.jpg","title":"How rest world celebrating Prince Harry Meghan Markles wedding","story":"    Guests at the Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club in Nairobi, Kenya (pictured) are being offered a wedding viewing party - complete with a \u0027champagne toast and live commentary throughout the ceremony\u0027Guests at the Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club in Kenya are being offered a wedding viewing  party - complete with a \u0027champagne toast and live commentary throughout the ceremony\u0027.Those lucky enough to attend the swanky do are invited to wear their \u0027finest wedding guest attire,\u0027 according to a poster advertising the event dubbed \u0027A Royal Wedding Celebration\u0027, and will indulge in British-inspired canapes and some bubbly.            For one million Kenyan shillings - or about £7,500 per guest - guests will also enjoy a two-night hotel stay, a helicopter trip to Mount Kenya plus all their meals leading up the televised ceremonyFor one million Kenyan Shillings - or about £7,500 per person - guests will also enjoy a two-night hotel stay, a helicopter trip to Mount Kenya plus all their meals prepped leading up the televised ceremony.  Meanwhile, royal watchers in Dubai - whose invitations are still in the post -have an array of places to lay their hat and cheer on the bride.The palatial Al Fayrooz lounge is  putting on English afternoon tea to guests who can watch the wedding on a 60inch screen while sat in their best wedding attire.For those wanting a more traditional English setting despite their desert surroundings, Gordon Ramsey\u0027s Bread Street Kitchen is hosting a wedding day brunch.And Scottish-themed pub The Copper Dog is providing Sunday roasts and glasses of vino in front of wide screen projectors for a snip at Dhs115 - or about £20.  For expats who made the transatlantic journey stateside, followers of the American Miss Markle need not look very far to find their share of wedding day bonhomie.Harry and Meghan look relaxed as they leave Windsor Castle...Share this articleThe most notable of which could be at in New Orleans at the Windsor Court hotel.The plush hotel is advertising a particularly pricey Royal Wedding Weekend Experience for a couple to receive a round-trip, first-class airfare from anywhere in the United States, three nights in the luxurious two-bedroom Presidential Suite, an afternoon ladies’ hat-fitting at a premier local milliner, and a $4,000 hotel credit for food, drinks and spa services.

Small but inconvenient fact: it was New Labour’s loosening of gambling laws in 2005 that probably caused many of today’s gambling-addiction problems. How distant now seems the amoralism of the Blair years.Iain Duncan Smith (Con, Chingford \u0026amp Woodford Green) offered Miss Crouch ‘congratulations’. Ronnie Cowan – slovenly with hand in pocket and no tie – for the SNP was similarly delighted. Carolyn Harris (Lab, Swansea E) started gushing ‘thank yous’ to the minister for doing something to reduce the social damage of machines which have cost some gambling addicts ‘their houses, dignity and self-respect’. Norman Lamb (Lib Dem, N Norfolk) called the Statement ‘a considerable personal achievement’ for Miss Crouch ‘that she should be proud of’.With the only sceptical noises coming from Philip Davies (Con, Shipley) and John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon), can we really regard yesterday’s decision to change the maximum stakes on these machines as such a ‘considerable personal achievement’?PM? Hilarity? You might as well ask a puffin to whistle:...Tom Watson gave a display greasy enough to test one\u0027s...Share this articleWould it not be more accurate to call Miss Crouch’s move yesterday ‘inevitable and low-risk’?Dear readers, welcome to the world of lobbying. The bookies of Britain are formidable networkers. They attend political party conferences and buy an awful lot of drinks. They lean on Cabinet ministers. Two years ago almost a third of financial donations to MPs came from sports and betting firms. Kerching kerching.So that is what Mr Lamb was possibly referring to: Miss Crouch had overturned the lobbyists’ charabanc. The sports mistress certainly brought an air of virtue to proceedings. Miss Crouch is haloed by a toothpastey earnestness. What a clean-living, keep-fit sort of person she is. It is almost a surprise that she does not turn up on the front bench in a track-suit.          The Government has cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals – dubbed the “crack cocaine” of gambling – from £100 to £2If you think that far-fetched, let it be recorded that on Wednesday the Secretary of State for International Development, Penny Mordaunt, attended PMQs in a rugby shirt bearing the logo of UK Aid.And yet, for all her sporty incorruptability, Miss Crouch often seems to have a runny nose. Does she eat enough liver?She said a ‘significant’ factor in her decision to go for such a low maximum stake had been her personal meetings with problem gamblers.There had been talk the Government might go for a compromise and lower the fixed-odds stakes to only £30 – this was something Mr Whittingdale raised – but Miss Crouch described how several of the gambling addicts she met had told her they considered committing suicide, such was their desperation. She sounded shaken by this.John Hayes (Con, S Holland \u0026amp the Deepings) averred that gambling is now nothing like his father’s weekly pools coupons.Bob Seely (Con, Isle of Wight), who is becoming so furiously pious a figure that the Bishop of Portsmouth might want to raise his game, compared bookies to parasites. Andrew Selous (Con, SW Beds) zoomed off into orbit, demanding that the Government’s next social crusade should be against fast-food adverts aimed at children.Methodist brimstone is no longer thought quite the thing in pulpits but here at Westminster we’re only just warming up.They’ll be calling for plain packaging for wine and spirits next, just you watch. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/10/05B0632B000003E8-0-image-a-19_1524648686192.jpg","title":"Army brass admit 5 000 troops short targets missed month","story":"    Troop numbers have fallen to 77,120 this month down from 78,410 at the same time last yearThe fall in numbers comes despite a new recruitment campaign that emphasised it is acceptable for soldiers to cry and pray in an attempt to reach out to a much broader base.A growing recruitment crisis has been blamed on an online application system beset by blunders, low morale, lack of frontline fighting, and better paid jobs elsewhere.Nia Griffith MP, Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary, said: ‘These figures represent a shocking failure by the Government to recruit and retain the Armed Forces personnel that our country requires.British army now has more than 17,000 troops unfit to fight...UK troops in Estonia `to counter intensifying aggression´...Fresh warning after further fall in Army recruitment numbersShare this article‘Just last year the Conservatives made a clear manifesto promise to maintain the overall size of the Armed Forces but today’s figures reveal that this commitment is not worth the paper it was written on.‘At a time when we face growing challenges to our national security, it is simply not acceptable that this crisis in recruitment and retention is being allowed to grow.’She said the Government must ‘overhaul’ its ‘disastrous recruitment contract’ with Capita which was ‘clearly failing to deliver any of the benefits that were promised’.Official figures showed earlier this year that a record high of around 100,000 people tried to join the Army last year, but fewer than 7,500 eventually became soldiers.          Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith says a fall in troop numbers represents a \u0027shocking failure by the Government to recruit and retain the Armed Forces personnel that our country requires\u0027The Army needs around 10,000 new soldiers a year to maintain its size.Capita signed a £1.3billion deal with the MoD to run recruitment in 2012. The Army began using the new system first, but it was rolled out to the Navy and RAF in November. According to figures released yesterday, the full-time strength of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines is at 29,300 down from 29,580 at the same time last year.The full-time trained strength of the Royal Air Force is at 30,350, down from 30,850 at the same time last year.The figures come as defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested funding for the armed forces should be on a par with the NHS.Tobias Ellwood said he was ‘deeply concerned’ that Britain was taking its security for granted as the world gets more dangerous.The Ministry of Defence faces a black hole of as much as £20 billion over the next decade.Mr Ellwood said spending on the armed forces must increase.Mr Ellwood said: ‘You go back to the 1970s and 1980s and there was a parity between defence spending compared with health and education - and today we have dropped back to 2 per cent.‘The Government often does what people call for. If people call for more money for schools and hospitals, that is often where the money then flows. It is important we raise the profile of the dangers of reducing our defence posture. Once you lose it, you will never get it back.‘I am deeply concerned we have a nation which is fully appreciative of our armed forces but which takes our security for granted.’ On Tuesday, the US ambassador to London said Britain must consider how it wants to be perceived by America and its adversaries while weighing up how it spends its national budget. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/00/4C5679EE00000578-0-image-m-76_1526513827555.jpg","title":"University cheerleading team accused cultural appropriation sombreros","story":"    A cheerleading squad has reportedly been put on probation by the University of Birmingham over plans for a Mexican-themed tour (file photo, unclear if these people were involved)According to the University\u0027s Redbrick website and student news site The Tab, requests for the Mexican tour theme to be changed due to its \u0027racial insensitivity\u0027 were ignored by the group.Some members of the Birmingham Pussycats have also been accused of singing the N-word from Gold Digger at an event.The team has now reportedly been placed on a year long probation and urged to take action - including the appointment of a ersity officer.Commons speaker John Bercow in fresh row as he is alleged to...Parts of Met Police are STILL \u0027institutionally racist\u0027 says...Share this articleIf the terms of the probation is broken, it is understood sanctions could include being excluded from official university events, the cancellation of training facilities and removal of university grants.In a statement, the University of Birmingham said it was \u0027aware of reports of some unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour among a small group of students.\u0027We take equality, ersity and inclusion very seriously, and we have already put in place a number of measures to address any inappropriate behaviour and further educate those involved through dedicated training and awareness-raising activities and will continue to do so.\u0027          It is claimed that requests for the Mexican tour theme to be changed due to its \u0027racial insensitivity\u0027 were ignored by the group (file photo, unclear if these people were involved)Guild of Students sports officer, Helena Bailey said: \u0027\u0027I am disappointed to hear of racial incidents reportedly taking place within the University of Birmingham  cheerleading squad.\u0027The Guild of Students stands strongly against all racist discriminatory behaviour.\u0027Both the Guild and the University have a strict no-tolerance policy against any form of discrimination and we are committed to creating an inclusive and welcoming community for all.\u0027We understand the cheerleading squad has been placed on a year-long probation by UB Sport and we welcome further steps, including a club-wide racial awareness course and the election of a Diversity Officer to the clubs committee.\u0027No-one from Birmingham Pussycats was available for comment. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/17/4C3B68BA00000578-0-image-m-105_1526572931225.jpg","title":"No wonder Meghan invited bet life theres embarrassment come","story":"     Thomas Markle Junior who has been snubbed from his sister\u0027s weddingUndoubtedly, Meghan would also want her two adored nephews — his sons Tyler and Thomas — to enjoy the occasion, along with her various uncles and aunts.

I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/14/4C5A658500000578-5739473-Charles_and_Camilla_have_been_pictured_leaving_Kensington_Palace-a-4_1526563464044.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them from Windsor Castle after the rehearsal yesterday as it was revealed Harry\u0027s father will give her away tomorrow          Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statementMeghan and Harry\u0027s wedding and 10 key questions about how it...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the \u0027Markle...\u0027We\u0027re super excited!\u0027 Nervous choir boys take part in final...Elton John \u0027will perform at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s...Meghan\u0027s sister \u0027breaks her ankle in car crash\u0027 after...I feel petty: Amy Schumer says the Royal Wedding will...Meghan Markle\u0027s brother says she will be the \u0027PERFECT modern...Meghan Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Gabriel Macht and Rick...Your complete guide to watching the royal wedding on...\u0027I don\u0027t find stereotypes relatable!\u0027 Former Teen Wolf star...Share this article    The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The star\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role.In statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. After a series of setbacks which have seen her father pull out of the ceremony and her half-brother call the wedding a \u0027mistake\u0027, Meghan will make final preparations today ahead of the ceremony at Windsor on Saturday. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Today Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, who has been staying at Kensington Palace, will meet the Queen to complete a whirlwind introduction to the royal family after flying in from Los Angeles on Wednesday. She has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.            Meghan was forced to make an extraordinary and moving statement confirming her father will no longer walk her down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday   Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle (pictured right last week) is recovering from heart surgery and will now not attend the wedding          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support.

That is expected later today.However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.        Try out a Tuxe Bodywear bodysuit like Meghan MarkleTuxe Bodywear the boss pussy-bow silk crepe de chine bodysuitShop it hereHate it when your silky top comes un-tucked?

Many speculated that the bride\u0027s father was in poor health, while others believed it was family politicsThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points.

I never knew her, but she lives on in her recipe.We still have the cake now, thickly sliced and buttered, and I think of my late great-grandmother trying to run a business and rule her handsome sons with a rod of iron.My granny, Joan, married the third son. Her recipes provide the post-war basics that should be part of everyone’s repertoire: flapjacks, scones and apple crumble — good old British stodge.I remember her kitchen: the tiny sink with the gas boiler that gave a terrifying ‘wump’ every time the hot water was turned on. And the kitchen cabinet with the flip-down Formica table, pale blue with black flowers, and the frosted sliding doors that always stuck. Inside was a big jar of sugar with a worrying black vanilla pod inside — I thought it was some kind of insect.I still make her flapjacks today and every time I eat them, I think of her: a gentle nurse who fell in love with a policeman, who died too young from a brain tumour when I was four.My mother — her daughter, Jennifer — must have taken ownership of the recipe box before Joan died.For in the early Sixties, the recipes become more daring. My parents got married in Cyprus when my father, Miles, was posted there as an Army Captain. Whisked from Twickenham to Limassol, my mother extended her culinary repertoire by taking advantage of the local cuisine.The cards from that era reveal how to deal with mystifying vegetables such as aubergines and an elaborate menu plan for a Greek mezze, as well as a recipe for something called a Kyrenia lunch — a melange of mince and spices and peppers which seems very contemporary now, but when she cooked it for us as children it seemed very exotic.Yet all of these dishes would have been out of most people’s experience in Britain in those days. My parents brought copious notes when they returned in 1963 so they could bring a little bit of Cyprus home with them once their posting had ended.

Mugs, masks, bunting and a VERY...Allergy sufferers slam McDonald\u0027s after the fast food giant...Share this articleA few years later, my brother and I had arrived, and the influence of my paternal Irish grandmother, Edre, becomes apparent in the little box. Paul and I would be dispatched across the Irish Sea for the summer holidays, and Edre would take a carload of cousins down to the wild coast of Kerry for a fortnight.There, we survived on her homemade soda bread, sweet and cakey, with dollops of homemade raspberry jam.She would bring along great tins of cakes and biscuits — melting moments, scrumptious squares and date slices to lug to the beach for sustenance.She wrote out the recipes so I could bring them home with me. Bring her home with me.It was from Edre I learned the power of food and family and friendship, how to bring everyone together with something as simple as yesterday’s leftover chicken and rice in a big warming soup, shoved into a Thermos flask and drunk on a picnic rug on a windswept beach. She died in 1988, but I still think of her when I cook all those recipes.In 1972, my father was posted to the U.S., and so we went to live in Washington DC.My brother and I, aged six and nine, were incredibly excited. This was a whole new world.We had an enormous refrigerator that made ice — a huge contrast to the wibbly-wobbly ice-cube tray that we slid into the freezer compartment barely big enough for a pack of frozen peas and a tub of soft-scoop ice cream back in England. And it was here we tasted our first Big Macs — a complete unknown in England at the time — and we would boast to friends back home of this new delicacy. Pizza was also a revelation —the endless strands of stringy mozzarella filled us with glee.We began to gather new culinary experiences: freshly picked corn-on-the-cob cooked on the barbecue, steaks the size of a 33rpm record, candied yams (no, no, no!).We began to collect new recipes feverishly. Blueberry cheesecake. Mexican casserole: a curious dish made with chicken, mushroom soup and grated cheese with crushed Doritos on top. And the piece de resistance that became a family favourite: chocolate chip cake.Despite the glamour and excitement of this new world, we had moments of homesickness.Another Army family reached out and invited us in. Mrs Thompson provided spreads of such magnificence we still talk about them now, and chocolate chip cake was her signature dish, made with sour cream and dark chocolate chips in a bundt tin, which seemed impossibly elaborate.I demanded the recipe, and I have lost count of how many times I made this cake as a weekend treat for us all. I didn’t need the recipe card in the end. I can recite it in my sleep.I’ve since tried to make it in England and it doesn’t quite work — perhaps the cup sizes are different, or the flour not right. I’m determined one day to play with the ingredients and restore it to its former glory.We left America after five wonderful years and settled into what became the family home in Berkshire. It was the late Seventies, and dinner parties were all the rage.I would hover by my mother as she made poulet au vin and hazelnut gateau, truite Normande and meringue pyramid pudding, longing to be old enough to sit at the table but having to be content with handing around peanuts, then listening to laughter drift up the stairs. If I was lucky, there would be leftovers.By the time I was 15, I was allowed to hold my own dinner parties. I plundered the recipe box for inspiration and added my own inventions.          From left to right: Veronica\u0027s grandmother Edre, Veronica as a baby, great grandmother Milly, and mother Jennifer pictured in 1963My friends would arrive, dropped off by their parents and dressed up to the nines, clutching bottles of Paul Masson wine (these empty bottles graced every kitchen in the Seventies, filled with rice, pasta and kidney beans).Somehow our decadent behaviour was overlooked because the table had been properly laid: a folded napkin and a candlestick covers up many sins!I’d make Hungarian goulash and Marie Biscuit chocolate pudding — a heart-stopping concoction of chocolatey, creamy stickiness.The record player was turned up to ten and everyone stubbed out their cigarettes on their plate. Nowadays, the music would be streamed wirelessly, no one would smoke and the pudding would be vilified for being far too calorific . . .Later, I kept the box alive with my own recipes when I started my own family: I got married in 1989 and soon had three growing boys of my own to feed.There are endless favourites: my signature cassoulet, which has evolved from a scientific trial of every recipe I can find for it.The Coca-Cola cake I make for every child’s birthday, as it’s the easiest and most forgiving cake recipe I’ve ever made — enhanced by the addition of a can of cola instead of sugar, and it never fails, not even when you are desperately trying to organise a party for 20 small boys.The glorious lemon tart which is perfect for picnics. The tarte tatin which always looks a mess, but which is a melting pile of buttery-caramelised apple heaven.Cooking these favourites is my way of holding my family together, whatever the occasion.But I still go back to the recipes of my grandmothers. For my father’s 80th birthday party, I ordered a side of smoked salmon from the village where he’d spent his childhood summers. There was only one thing to eat it with: my grandmother’s soda bread, with cold butter, a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of black pepper.He had all his family around him as we devoured this simple reminder of our heritage, his childhood little did we know that this would be the last time we were all together before he passed away.And now as my older sons, Jake, 27, and Sam, 22, go out in the world and are catering for themselves they phone me up. How do you make crab linguine? How do you get that crispy topping on your fish pie?

Eight out of 15 of the filters tested positive for this micro-organism, which is among a type of bacteria known to cause food poisoning.Manhattan lawyer tries to go incognito by changing outfits...Would you pay $1,000 to see Ed Sheeran? Ticketmaster cracks...Share this articleBacillus subtilis and Bacillus were the second most common micro-organisms found. Bacillus subtilis are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some mammals. They generally do not cause disease but have been known to cause septicaemia in a patient with leukaemia.Bacillus is more dangerous and has links with a wide range of infections including meningitis, abscesses and septicaemia.          Swabs of 15 air conditioning filters were taken from cars across the UK and sent for laboratory analysis. Micro-organisms were detected in all of the filters tested at London Metropolitan UniversityA car’s air con works by mixing fresh air from outside with a refrigerant and the mixture turns into liquid as it is cooled. It is then turned into vapour as it travels through evaporation coils and blown into the cabin as cool air. It is the evaporator in the system that provides perfect conditions for bacteria, mould and fungi to build up and thrive. Although the car filter will prevent many pollutants entering the passenger compartment, it will not stop all micro-organisms.The research was commissioned by Kwik Fit, which urged drivers to clean their air conditioning systems at least once every two years.On average, the test found 1.6 different strains of mico-organisms within the filters.Drivers in Plymouth had the most contaminated cars, with an average of 2.3 varieties of micro-organism per vehicle. Dundee closely followed, with each filter having on average two strains of micro-organism.Coming in just under the overall average figure and at the bottom of the table was Cardiff, with an average of one type of micro-organism per filter tested.Dr Paul Matewele, a senior lecturer specialising in microbiology at London Metropolitan, said: ‘Some of the bacteria found has links to animals, the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some infections that could cause a lot of harm to iniduals, especially those with a compromised immune system.‘The study highlights that air conditioning systems are suitable breeding grounds for bacteria and therefore underlines the importance of cleaning and replacing filters.‘I’m sure if car owners knew what they were blowing out of their air conditioning vents they would think twice before switching them on this summer.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/01/4C61425500000578-0-image-a-4_1526601946798.jpg","title":"HARRY MOUNT finds left wing artistss opinions skewed facts","story":"    Left-wing artist Alice Procter\u0027s tours go round the National Portrait Gallery, the National Gallery, the British Museum, the V\u0026ampA, the Queen’s House in Greenwich and Tate BritainThe National Portrait Gallery is the country’s home for pictures of our greatest heroes, right? Wrong — if you’re Alice Procter, the 23- year-old Australian who leads her Uncomfortable Art Tours around London’s museums and galleries.Her tours go round the National Portrait Gallery, the National Gallery, the British Museum, the V\u0026ampA, the Queen’s House in Greenwich and Tate Britain.In the two-hour tours, independent of the galleries, she explains how: ‘The history of British art is also the history of empire and genocide, written by collectors who traded in landscapes and lives.’Procter is an MA student in material culture, who has been a tour guide for six years and doing Uncomfortable Art Tours for a year. On her website, promoting her tour of Tate Britain, Queen Victoria has ‘THIEF’ scrawled across her face in red paint. Nelson’s portrait has the words ‘WHITE SUPREMACIST’ drawn on it. For the National Portrait Gallery tour, Elizabeth I has ‘SLAVER’ slapped over a portrait of the monarch.It’s a pretty rum approach to some of the greatest and most celebrated figures in British history. But then we live in an age when it is fashionable to denigrate our island story, and instead take a virulently anti-colonial view of the world. That’s now the accepted attitude on most campuses and in many schools.Consider those shrill demands to tear down a statue of empire builder Cecil Rhodes in Oxford, or the torrent of abuse from fellow academics directed at an Oxford don who recently dared to suggest the British Empire did much good as well as bad.Then there’s the Guardian columnist who argued Nelson should be hauled down from his column for his racist views.          Procter wears a T-shirt saying ‘Museums are not neutral’ — the name of an American campaign which highlights how galleries have ‘the potential to be relevant, socially engaged spaces in our communities, acting as agents of positive change’. Pictured: Graffiti on a Elizabeth I poster to promote the artist\u0027s tourThis art tour is just the latest example of how the Left is trying to rewrite our past and shout down any opposition.So how well does Procter argue her case?Elizabeth I — in the famous Ditchley portrait of her by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger — is our first stop on one of the tours of the National Portrait Gallery, on which I tagged along. The tour was called ‘Picturing Power: Imperial Subjects from Elizabeth to Victoria’.It is a splendid picture of the Queen, painted in around 1592, standing on a map of her kingdom, ruling over all she surveys.However, we are not here to admire the beauty of the pictures, or the skill of the artists — the artists are barely mentioned in the tour, costing £19.99. We are here to criticise.‘One thing everyone knows about Elizabeth I is that she had black teeth because she liked sugar so much,’ says Procter.           Speaking  of Captain Cook, she said: ‘He was perfectly willing to capture indigenous people, to shoot people if they got in his way, to take stuff’‘But no one ever really talks about where the sugar came from, and it’s during Elizabeth’s reign that we see the beginning of the British slave trade, and trade with plantations using slave labour. The first slave-trading voyage was bankrolled by Elizabeth I.’Procter is right about the existence of British slave-trading then. But, when one of the 20-strong audience on the tour asks whether the British slave-trading expedition in 1562 under John Hawkins, was at the same time as the Spanish Armada, she is stumped.‘I think it’s just after the Armada,’ she says.In fact, Elizabeth I’s defeat of the Armada happened in 1588 — as every schoolchild used to know, before history lessons, and the study of facts, were destroyed by the triumph of opinion and political correctness in the classroom.Procter wears a T-shirt saying ‘Museums are not neutral’ — the name of an American campaign which highlights how galleries have ‘the potential to be relevant, socially engaged spaces in our communities, acting as agents of positive change’.She also gives out badges bearing the words ‘Display it like you stole it,’ a slogan designed to encourage museum curators and visitors to rethink the politics of how art is presented in exhibitions.Next up, Sir Walter Raleigh — captured in a magnificent anonymous portrait — one of our greatest explorers, who helped colonise Virginia, named after Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen. Yet on this tour he is pure villain, damned by Procter as ‘part of those first British slave-trading voyages’.A similar attitude is shown towards William Dampier (1651-1715) — painted by Thomas Murray — who was the first Englishman to explore Australia and the first man to circumnavigate the world three times.Procter’s withering anti-colonialist verdict? ‘The first encounters with indigenous Australians end in murder.’Every picture we stop at offers her the opportunity to recount the story of relentless British nastiness.          Clive of India — Robert Clive, who extended the East India Company’s control in the sub-continent in the 18th century? ‘He wasn’t afraid to indiscriminately massacre people — and he fought dirty’Procter says: ‘In Nelson’s navy, 20 per cent were enslaved people and people of colour. \u0027The navy under Nelson was the single biggest purchaser of slaves anywhere in the world. \u0027Nelson was an anti-abolitionist and repeatedly voted against any kind of abolition bills in the House of Lords.’At one point, Procter gets so wound up that she can’t stop herself swearing.When she refers to critics who questioned whether the Crimean War nurse Mary Seacole should be celebrated as a black British heroine when her statue was unveiled two years ago, because she was ‘only a quarter black’, Procter says: ‘What the f*** is going on there?’The National Portrait Gallery, in fact, took great steps to promote Seacole’s cause, buying her portrait in 2008 and putting it on prominent display.‘Mary Seacole was just as crucial as Florence Nightingale, but is far less known about and historically respected,’ says Procter.Yet again, though, our guide trips up on her facts.‘Florence Nightingale has a massive statue in Whitehall,’ she says. No, she doesn’t. It’s in Waterloo Place.She’s on even shakier territory when she discusses Britain’s cultural heritage outside London.Referring to All Souls College, Oxford, she talks about its library, built using slave plantation money.And the name of the slave owner? ‘At All Souls, the library is named after a man called Colville,’ she says.No, it isn’t. He was called Christopher Codrington, a slave owner and sugar plantation magnate who bequeathed part of his fortune to the college in 1710 to establish the library that bears his name.Overall, Procter justifies the way she judges the past by the standards of today by saying: ‘History is unfixed . . . Our ancestors judged their ancestors so we’re just judging them in turn.’OK — even though it’s a suspect judgment — shouldn’t historians at least try to be objective?And, if you’re going to judge the past, wouldn’t it be helpful to get your facts right?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/00/4C60D7DE00000578-0-image-m-26_1526600041047.jpg","title":"Britain double military presence Afghanistan send extra 400 troops","story":"    An extra 400 military personnel could be sent to the war zone as part of a Nato training mission.

I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,\u0027 said Alec at the time.Things got so bad between the two during the separation that Alec\u0027s father Daniel had Jocelyn banned from the family properties - a New York town house, their Paris chateau (the largest private residence in the city at the time), the 66,000-acre Ol Jogi ranch, and the private compound in the British Virgin Islands.At the same time her credit cards were cut off and had her monthly allowance lowered to just $50,000, which her lawyers fought in court.That all changed however with her massive settlement in 1999, which has allowed her to live comfortably ever since.Jocelyn and Alec first met when she was 31 and they were both on safari with friends in Kenya at Ol Jogi.\u0027A lion had to be killed at a neighbor’s ranch,\u0027 Alec recalled in Vanity Fair.\u0027The night before, Jocelyn asked, Could I go with you?

That is expected later today.However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.             Prince William is seen leaving Windsor Castle during the final preparations for Saturday\u0027s royal wedding          William and Kate were also photographed leaving Kensington Palace as they joined the couple in Windsor for rehearsalsThe Queen hosts the annual garden party at Buckingham PalaceSpectator pots pool player\u0027s wayward shot with incredible volleyRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportLast British Dambuster flies in a Lancaster bomber cockpitChinese Muslims face terrible conditions in re-education camps\u0027I\u0027m Batman\u0027 declares Michael Keaton at end of commencement speechListen to the voice of the man who says he is D.B.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle.Journalist Sean Mandell said Miss Markle\u0027s father had told him: \u0027It will take a long time to heal.

An extensive team of suited bodyguards guarded the entrance to Coworth Park supported by uniformed officers from the Hampshire Constabulary Marine Unit who arrived in a marked van.

It is thought that the prince may choose the Dower house, a Grade II-listed private cottage in the grounds dating from 1775 which boasts its own charming river garden.The hotel also offers guests their own personal butler and a Michelin-starred restaurant. The rooms feature four-poster beds, copper roll-top baths and velvet chaise longues.Another unusual feature is a swimming pool that plays music under water.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/22/4C6020FF00000578-0-image-a-9_1526591140002.jpg","title":"Brexit dividend Ministers say UK save 100m not holding EU elections","story":"    The last elections to the European Parliament (pictured) in 2014 cost UK taxpayers £109million, according to reportsTheresa May says it is \u0027unacceptable\u0027 for Commons speaker...Corbyn U-turns on his promise not to create any new Labour...Share this article    Iain Duncan-Smith, the former leader of the Tory Party and a leading Eurosceptic, hailed the early Brexit idendHe told Irish broadcaster RTE: \u0027Certainly any move on customs that brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed but resolving the issue of avoiding a hard border requires more than customs.\u0027His comments will spark fears that Ireland is plotting to use the thorny issue of the Irish border to force the UK to stay in the EU single market and customs union.Mrs May has scrambled to try to quell Brexiteer unease over her fallback option by insisting that Britain will be able to strike its own free trade deals after the transition deal ends at the end of 2020.Speaking at a press conference in Macedonia yesterday she said Britain would have an \u0027independent trade policy\u0027 after its departure.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/10/4C64D05E00000578-0-image-m-13_1526636249955.jpg","title":"I called demolition specialists Mike Tindall jokes nose job","story":"    Mike Tindall joked he was forced to call in demolition specialists to fix his broken nose \u0027He blew me out, cold and simple\u0027: Mike Tindall jokes that...Share this articleSpeaking to Good Morning Britain this morning, he said: \u0027I think considering the size it was before, the surgeon had to call in some demolition specialists.   \u0027He\u0027s done a good job, it\u0027s nice being able to smell the flowers\u0027.   During his 12-year playing career, the former Bath and Gloucester centre broke his nose at least eight times. Presenters Kate Gallaway and Ben Shepherd joked Tindall had merely fixed his nose in time for his cousin-in-law\u0027s wedding in Windsor tomorrow.       Before and after: The 2003 England Rugby World Cup champion is famed for his crooked beak which he has broke nine times throughout his lifeHe considered having surgery before his marriage to Zara Phillips in 2011, after her mother, Princess Anne, offered to pay for the surgery.  After  retiring from playing in 2014, Tindall decided to consider the operation because he was suffering persistent breathing difficulties. Tindall, who has become a pundit and reality TV star, told the Daily Mirror: \u0027I guess it\u0027s something similar to a pug.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/10/4C5DB08500000578-0-image-a-34_1526635508716.jpg","title":"Samantha Markle inviting friends royal wedding party Florida home","story":"    Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister is hosting a party at her home on Saturday after she was not invited to the real royal wedding following a series of controversial claims she has made          Samantha and her boyfriend will host friends at a formal party at their home in Silver SpringsGuests are being told to come in formal attire, with US gossip website TMZ reporting Samantha is planning to wearing a smart dress and \u0027vintage art deco hat\u0027. Samantha, 53, told the website she still loves Meghan and it will be \u0027bittersweet\u0027 to watch Meghan walk down the aisle.Samantha will be drafting in off-duty police officers to keep out any gatecrashers, TMZ reported.No wonder Meghan hasn’t invited them!

Thomas Clarkson, Abolitionist and campaigner became a target of slave-traders, receiving several death threats and beatings, and it was not actually until 1787, that Wilberforce, as MP for Hull, became personally active in the abolitionist cause. A  biography produced shortly after their father\u0027s death in 1838, William Wilberforce\u0027s sons, Robert and Samuel, greatly downplayed Clarkson\u0027s contributionFrom the mid-1780s, Clarkson was instrumental in raising public awareness of the brutality of slavery, publishing essays, giving speeches, visiting trading ports and even stowing away on-board slave ships in order to gather evidence.In the course of his work, he soon became a target of slave-traders, receiving several death threats and beatings, and it was not actually until 1787, that Wilberforce, as MP for Hull, became personally active in the abolitionist cause.Whilst Wilberforce\u0027s stirring Parliamentary speeches were integral in putting the crucial legislative machinery in place, it was invariably the evidence acquired by Clarkson that gave them their moral weight.In a controversial biography produced shortly after their father\u0027s death in 1838, William Wilberforce\u0027s sons, Robert and Samuel, greatly downplayed Clarkson\u0027s contribution, depicting him as little more than an assistant to their more proactive and \u0027inely-inspired\u0027 father.Though Clarkson would subsequently publish a rebuttal of their \u0027cruel and unwarrantable attack\u0027 (prompting a private apology from the Wilberforce family), it was the latter\u0027s name that would become synonymous with the ending of the slave-trade in Britain.Walter Tull, Tottenham and Northampton footballer, first black officer in the British Army (1888 - 1918)  Tull, born in Folkestone in 1888 to a Barbadian father and English mother, first achieved fame as one of the first black players in the English Football League, playing for Tottenham Hotspur between 1909 and 1911, before moving to Northampton.In December 1914, Tull enlisted in the British army, rising through the ranks to become second-lieutenant despite a military injunction precluding \u0027negroes\u0027 from officer status.Though, as an officer, he was praised for his \u0027gallantry and coolness\u0027, Tull was later controversially denied a Military Cross. He was killed, in March 1918, aged 30, at the Battle of Bapaume in Northern France. His body was never found.  Walter Tull first achieved fame as one of the first black players in the English Football League, playing for Tottenham Hotspur between 1909 and 1911, before moving to Northampton. In December 1914, Tull enlisted in the British army, rising through the ranks to become second-lieutenant despite a military injunction precluding \u0027negroes\u0027 from officer status.In 2016, Tull\u0027s biographer Phil Vasili, uncovered evidence suggesting how Tull\u0027s senior officers may have colluded to prevent him from receiving the recognition to which he was, unquestionably, due. In a memo dated 19 February 1918, the Head of Recruitment to the War and Colonial Offices, General White, asserted that \u0027wooly headed n*****s\u0027 would not be required at the forthcoming spring offensive: \u0027We now refuse to post coloured men to \u0027white units\u0027, the memo went on, \u0027These n*****s must therefore go to native units if accepted.\u0027The first English king to issue a Law Code: King Æthelberht of Kent (c. 560 - 616)  Not only was Æthelberht the first English king to embrace Christianity, he was also the first to issue a written legal code, pre-empting what is normally invoked as the foundation stone of English constitutional law, Magna Carta, by over six hundred years.Conceivably, the Anglo-Saxon ruler - now forgotten - did as much to lay the foundations of early modern Britain as any English king prior to 1066.Like most Anglo-Saxon kings, exact details of Æthelberht\u0027s life and times are hard to verify.The most successful English politician of the fifteenth century: Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby (1433 - 1509) Twice-married by the age of twelve (and a widowed mother by the age of thirteen) Margaret devoted much of her life to the successful promotion of her only child, Henry Tudor to the English throne as Henry VII.Following Henry\u0027s victory over Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, Margaret was granted a degree of legal and social independence normally reserved only for Queens of England, including the right to hold property independent of her husband.  After allegedly being born on a slave ship, Ignatius Sancho was transported to England where he was a slave to the second Duke of Mantagu. But his intelligence did not go unnoticed and he was eventually set free and subsequently allowed to vote in electionsFirst known black man to vote in a British election: Ignatius Sancho, Writer and composer (c. 1729 - 1780) Allegedly born on board a slave ship in c. 1729 and orphaned by the age of two, Sancho was subsequently transported to England where he came under the watch of the second Duke of Montagu.Struck by the young slave\u0027s obvious intelligence, Montagu strove to educate Sancho, sharing books with him from his personal library, and cultivating his wider cultural tastes and interests. Following the duke\u0027s death in 1749, Sancho became butler to the duke\u0027s widow, one of the most important positions in an eighteenth-century aristocratic house. When the duchess died in 1751, she bequeathed Sancho an annuity of £30, as well as a year\u0027s salary to support himself with.Sancho\u0027s financial independence and status as a householder meant that he was the only known Afro-Briton qualified to vote in the parliamentary elections of 1774 and 1780.In addition to being the first known black man to vote in a British election he was also the first African to be afforded an obituary in the British press.Despite his apparent acceptance by eighteenth century English high society, Sancho\u0027s race and status as a former-slave became a source of considerable unease for those seeking to defend slavery against the growing abolitionist cause in the early nineteenth century.Not least, Sancho\u0027s deep intelligence and humanity went against those who claimed that Africans were somehow constitutionally incapable or deficient on this score.          Mary Anning achieved huge public attentions after discovering the first fossilised pterodactyl in Britain and her finding has even been said to have contributed to Darwin\u0027s theory of natural selectionPioneering Palaeontologist: Mary Anning, Fossil Collector, Palaeontologist (1799 - 1847) Born in Lyme Regis in 1799, Anning, from a young age, helped to supplement her family\u0027s modest income by selling fossils retrieved from cliffs near her childhood home.By her late teens she was making discoveries that would help to fundamentally reshape ideas of natural history and the evolution of species. In 1823, she discovered the first complete Plesiosaurus, complementing her previous discovery of a series of near-complete ichthyosaurs. In 1828, she achieved wide public attention with the discovery of the first fossilised Pterodactyl, or \u0027flying dragon\u0027, in Britain.Some scientists have suggested that Anning\u0027s findings contributed to Darwin\u0027s theory of natural selection. A poll carried out by the Royal Society in 2010, included Anning as one of the ten most influential women in British science.Anning struggled for due recognition in the male-dominated scientific community of the early 19th century, and her contributions to palaeontology went largely overlooked after her death.Many of the specimens she found were utilised by scientists and published in scientific journals without reference.She also had to overcome accusations of fraudulency from sceptical contemporaries such as the French naturalist Georges Cuvier, who accused her of fabricating new species by merging fossils from different animals.          Percy Pilcher was the first to invent the motor-powered aeroplane. But shortly after taking off in the flying machine, the tail snapped and he plunged 30ft to the ground and died from his injuries two days later (Nearly) invented the first powered aeroplane: Percy Pilcher, Pioneering Aviator (1866 - 1899)  By the end of the nineteenth century the international race to design and build a motor-powered aeroplane was heating up. Amongst those seeking to be the first to take flight was a British former naval engineer called Percy Pilcher.By September 30 1899, Pilcher was ready to demonstrate his prototype aircraft to a number of patrons and potential investors at Stanford Hall in Leicestershire. When problems with the engine prevented the launch from going ahead, Pilcher felt obliged to offer his audience a demonstration of his earlier Hawk glider. Shortly after take off the tail snapped, plunging Pilcher and his glider 30ft to the ground. He died from his injuries two days later.Four years later, the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved immortal fame with the successful launch of their own biplane prototype in North Carolina.In 2003, researchers at the School of Aeronautics at Cranfield University successfully built and launched a triplane based, with minor modifications, on Pilcher\u0027s original designs.           Four years later after Pilcher\u0027s death, the American brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved immortal fame with the successful launch of their own biplane prototype in North Carolina. Pilcher, pictured, was a partner in the firm Wilson and Pilcher Ltd, who began gliding in 1895Filmed by the BBC, the plane flew for one minute and 25 seconds, beating the first flight made by the Wright brothers in 1903 by 26 seconds.Pilcher\u0027s relative isolation as an independent engineer and early death at the age of 32 seems to have ensured that his designs and prototype died with him.The first qualified female surgeon and physician in Britain: Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Physician, social campaigner, suffragette (1836 - 1917) Born in Whitechapel, East London, Garrett first came to prominence as a member of the Langham Place circle, an offshoot of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women - a key focal point of the burgeoning mid-Victorian women\u0027s movement.In 1870, she became the first woman to obtain the qualification of Medical Doctor, and, in 1873, was finally admitted to membership of the British Medical Association.  Elizabeth Garret Anderson became the first woman to obtain the qualification of Medical Doctor, and, in 1873, was finally admitted to membership of the British Medical Association. She remained the only woman member of the BMA for 19 years following a vote to bar any further female admission in 1878Under pressure to resign after the association voted to bar any further female admission in 1878, she remained the only woman member of the BMA for nineteen years.In 1908, she was also elected as the first woman mayor in England, in the district of Aldeburgh.Anderson\u0027s numerous attempts to gain admission to study at medical school were denied.When, in 1865, she passed the society of Apothecaries examinations which allowed her to become a doctor, the society changed it rules to bar other women from entering the profession through this route.The British Medical Register also refused to recognise her medical degree from the University of Paris.Pioneer of inoculation against smallpox: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Aristocrat, writer and early pioneer of smallpox inoculation in England, (1689 - 1762) Whilst Edward Jenner (1749-1823), is often identified as the founder of modern vaccination techniques against smallpox, the 18th century aristocrat Mary Wortley Montagu arguably also deserves a place in the early history of immunology. It was during her time in Turkey in 1721, as wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman court, that Lady Mary was first introduced to the local practice of variolation as a means of protection against smallpox.           Arstocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is often identified as the founder of modern vaccination techniques against smallpox after being introduced to the local Turkish practice of variolation as a means of protection against smallpox. Her tenacity and commitment have been described by one historian as \u0027unparalleled in the annals of medical advance\u0027Returning to England, Lady Mary became an enthusiastic advocate of the Turkish method, fighting against considerable scepticism and resistance from doctors and wider society. Her tenacity and commitment have been described by one historian as \u0027unparalleled in the annals of medical advance.\u0027Lady Mary\u0027s promotion of the controversial foreign medical procedure prompted fierce debate in the British press and in wider society.Mary herself became subject to numerous slanderous and abusive attacks from journalists, medical practitioners and even clergymen.By the late 1720s, her infamy was such that people in the street would \u0027hoot at her as an unnatural mother\u0027.Working-class leader of the suffragette movement in early 20th century: Annie Kenney, Suffragette (1879 - 1953)           Annie Kenney is a little known Suffragette who was the first to speak and among the first to be arrested after she and Christbel Pankhurst unfurled a banner demanding the vote for women during a political meeting in 1905A name largely absent from the recent centenary commemorations of the 1918 Representation of the People Act was that of Annie Kenney. Born in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1879, Kenney began her working life in cotton mill at the age of 10.Once described as \u0027after the Pankhursts\u0027, the most daring and influential of the Suffragettes\u0027, she was the first to speak, and among the first to be arrested, after she and Christabel Pankhurst unfurled a banner demanding the vote for women at a political meeting, attended by Sir Edward Grey and Winston Churchill, in Manchester in 1905 - an event which effectively launched the era of suffragette militancy.The early labour movement\u0027s focus on industrial solidarity over women\u0027s rights, combined with her class meant it was harder for Kenney to achieve the same kind of recognition and authority as that produced by the \u0027upper-class\u0027 Pankhursts.Kenney\u0027s brother Robert, would later accuse his sister and other suffragettes of \u0027robbing the Socialist movement of its finest elements and wasting them in a fight for the vote, which was of little or no use compared with industrial solidarity and the making of Socialist converts.\u0027Pioneer in the theory and design of suspension bridges: Sarah Guppy, Inventor, Social Reformer (1770 - 1852)  In 1811, Guppy secured a patent for \u0027a new mode of constructing and erecting bridges and rail-roads without arches or sterlings, whereby the danger of being washed away by floods is avoided.\u0027The patent went on to describe a form of hanging bridge, connected by interlocking framing, which removed the need for stanchions in the riverbed itself. Guppy\u0027s proposed design was largely intended as a way of overcoming the difficulties of bridging the Bristol Avon - later famously addressed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who built the world-famous Clifton Suspension Bridge.A variant of her patent was also later asserted to have been employed by Thomas Telford in his construction of the Menai Suspension Bridge in 1826.Prohibitive social mores of the early 18th and 19th centuries, particularly those related to the place of women, as well as Guppy\u0027s own modesty all helped to ensure that her contributions to 19th century British industrial innovation were largely overlooked.She once suggested \u0027it is unpleasant to speak of oneself - it may seem boastful particularly in a woman.\u0027                                                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/18/4C5D364800000578-5741371-image-m-42_1526578806007.jpg","title":"Im Batman Michael Keaton sends Kent State graduation wild iconic line","story":"    Michael Keaton uttered the famous two words \u0027I\u0027m Batman\u0027 at Kent State\u0027s graduation    The actor played the Caped Crusader in Tim Burton\u0027s 1989 Batman and the 1992 sequelKeaton gave a near-20-minute inspirational speech with personal stories about his time at the university. He told the students that nothing compares to working hard toward their goals. \u0027If I could have found my way around hard work I would have,\u0027 he said. After receiving a plaque for his appearance as the key note speaker, the actor took over the microphone to share a quick message with the graduates.\u0027I\u0027ve got two words that I want you all to remember,\u0027 he said.  \u0027They\u0027re very important, and if I leave you with anything, I\u0027m going to leave you with these two words.

Small but inconvenient fact: it was New Labour’s loosening of gambling laws in 2005 that probably caused many of today’s gambling-addiction problems. How distant now seems the amoralism of the Blair years.Iain Duncan Smith (Con, Chingford \u0026amp Woodford Green) offered Miss Crouch ‘congratulations’. Ronnie Cowan – slovenly with hand in pocket and no tie – for the SNP was similarly delighted. Carolyn Harris (Lab, Swansea E) started gushing ‘thank yous’ to the minister for doing something to reduce the social damage of machines which have cost some gambling addicts ‘their houses, dignity and self-respect’. Norman Lamb (Lib Dem, N Norfolk) called the Statement ‘a considerable personal achievement’ for Miss Crouch ‘that she should be proud of’.With the only sceptical noises coming from Philip Davies (Con, Shipley) and John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon), can we really regard yesterday’s decision to change the maximum stakes on these machines as such a ‘considerable personal achievement’?PM?

The bookies of Britain are formidable networkers. They attend political party conferences and buy an awful lot of drinks. They lean on Cabinet ministers. Two years ago almost a third of financial donations to MPs came from sports and betting firms. Kerching kerching.So that is what Mr Lamb was possibly referring to: Miss Crouch had overturned the lobbyists’ charabanc. The sports mistress certainly brought an air of virtue to proceedings. Miss Crouch is haloed by a toothpastey earnestness. What a clean-living, keep-fit sort of person she is. It is almost a surprise that she does not turn up on the front bench in a track-suit.          The Government has cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals – dubbed the “crack cocaine” of gambling – from £100 to £2If you think that far-fetched, let it be recorded that on Wednesday the Secretary of State for International Development, Penny Mordaunt, attended PMQs in a rugby shirt bearing the logo of UK Aid.And yet, for all her sporty incorruptability, Miss Crouch often seems to have a runny nose. Does she eat enough liver?She said a ‘significant’ factor in her decision to go for such a low maximum stake had been her personal meetings with problem gamblers.There had been talk the Government might go for a compromise and lower the fixed-odds stakes to only £30 – this was something Mr Whittingdale raised – but Miss Crouch described how several of the gambling addicts she met had told her they considered committing suicide, such was their desperation. She sounded shaken by this.John Hayes (Con, S Holland \u0026amp the Deepings) averred that gambling is now nothing like his father’s weekly pools coupons.Bob Seely (Con, Isle of Wight), who is becoming so furiously pious a figure that the Bishop of Portsmouth might want to raise his game, compared bookies to parasites.

And, naturally, he would receive an RSVP from the Palace, for he had ‘always supported her, she knows that’, he said, recalling how he had taken Meghan to feed the ducks and babysat for her when she was little.Oh yes — and there was bound to be ‘a plus-one for Darlene’, he added, glancing at his 36-year-old fiancée, perched at his burly shoulder and hanging on his every word.\u0027Why can\u0027t she just say she loves him?\u0027: Social media users...Does Harry need a wife or a mother? Diana¿s death left her...Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry...\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Share this article‘I would love to meet the Royals. I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/14/4C5A658500000578-5739473-Charles_and_Camilla_have_been_pictured_leaving_Kensington_Palace-a-4_1526563464044.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them from Windsor Castle after the rehearsal yesterday as it was revealed Harry\u0027s father will give her away tomorrow          Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statementMeghan and Harry\u0027s wedding and 10 key questions about how it...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the \u0027Markle...\u0027We\u0027re super excited!\u0027 Nervous choir boys take part in final...Elton John \u0027will perform at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s...Meghan\u0027s sister \u0027breaks her ankle in car crash\u0027 after...I feel petty: Amy Schumer says the Royal Wedding will...Meghan Markle\u0027s brother says she will be the \u0027PERFECT modern...Meghan Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Gabriel Macht and Rick...Your complete guide to watching the royal wedding on...\u0027I don\u0027t find stereotypes relatable!\u0027 Former Teen Wolf star...Share this article    The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The star\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role.In statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. After a series of setbacks which have seen her father pull out of the ceremony and her half-brother call the wedding a \u0027mistake\u0027, Meghan will make final preparations today ahead of the ceremony at Windsor on Saturday. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Today Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, who has been staying at Kensington Palace, will meet the Queen to complete a whirlwind introduction to the royal family after flying in from Los Angeles on Wednesday. She has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.            Meghan was forced to make an extraordinary and moving statement confirming her father will no longer walk her down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday   Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

That is expected later today.However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.        Try out a Tuxe Bodywear bodysuit like Meghan MarkleTuxe Bodywear the boss pussy-bow silk crepe de chine bodysuitShop it hereHate it when your silky top comes un-tucked?

Many speculated that the bride\u0027s father was in poor health, while others believed it was family politicsThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow            A guide to the timings of the event on Saturday, from when the first guests arrive at 9.30am to the reception at 7pmArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million -

I never knew her, but she lives on in her recipe.We still have the cake now, thickly sliced and buttered, and I think of my late great-grandmother trying to run a business and rule her handsome sons with a rod of iron.My granny, Joan, married the third son. Her recipes provide the post-war basics that should be part of everyone’s repertoire: flapjacks, scones and apple crumble — good old British stodge.I remember her kitchen: the tiny sink with the gas boiler that gave a terrifying ‘wump’ every time the hot water was turned on. And the kitchen cabinet with the flip-down Formica table, pale blue with black flowers, and the frosted sliding doors that always stuck. Inside was a big jar of sugar with a worrying black vanilla pod inside — I thought it was some kind of insect.I still make her flapjacks today and every time I eat them, I think of her: a gentle nurse who fell in love with a policeman, who died too young from a brain tumour when I was four.My mother — her daughter, Jennifer — must have taken ownership of the recipe box before Joan died.For in the early Sixties, the recipes become more daring. My parents got married in Cyprus when my father, Miles, was posted there as an Army Captain. Whisked from Twickenham to Limassol, my mother extended her culinary repertoire by taking advantage of the local cuisine.The cards from that era reveal how to deal with mystifying vegetables such as aubergines and an elaborate menu plan for a Greek mezze, as well as a recipe for something called a Kyrenia lunch — a melange of mince and spices and peppers which seems very contemporary now, but when she cooked it for us as children it seemed very exotic.Yet all of these dishes would have been out of most people’s experience in Britain in those days. My parents brought copious notes when they returned in 1963 so they could bring a little bit of Cyprus home with them once their posting had ended.          The box contains hundreds of recipes, some of which are nearly a century old, and splattered with original ingredientsCoca-Cola vows to slash sugar in its Australian drinks by 10...Tat\u0027s for the memory! Mugs, masks, bunting and a VERY...Allergy sufferers slam McDonald\u0027s after the fast food giant...Share this articleA few years later, my brother and I had arrived, and the influence of my paternal Irish grandmother, Edre, becomes apparent in the little box. Paul and I would be dispatched across the Irish Sea for the summer holidays, and Edre would take a carload of cousins down to the wild coast of Kerry for a fortnight.There, we survived on her homemade soda bread, sweet and cakey, with dollops of homemade raspberry jam.She would bring along great tins of cakes and biscuits — melting moments, scrumptious squares and date slices to lug to the beach for sustenance.She wrote out the recipes so I could bring them home with me. Bring her home with me.It was from Edre I learned the power of food and family and friendship, how to bring everyone together with something as simple as yesterday’s leftover chicken and rice in a big warming soup, shoved into a Thermos flask and drunk on a picnic rug on a windswept beach. She died in 1988, but I still think of her when I cook all those recipes.In 1972, my father was posted to the U.S., and so we went to live in Washington DC.My brother and I, aged six and nine, were incredibly excited. This was a whole new world.We had an enormous refrigerator that made ice — a huge contrast to the wibbly-wobbly ice-cube tray that we slid into the freezer compartment barely big enough for a pack of frozen peas and a tub of soft-scoop ice cream back in England. And it was here we tasted our first Big Macs — a complete unknown in England at the time — and we would boast to friends back home of this new delicacy. Pizza was also a revelation —the endless strands of stringy mozzarella filled us with glee.We began to gather new culinary experiences: freshly picked corn-on-the-cob cooked on the barbecue, steaks the size of a 33rpm record, candied yams (no, no, no!).We began to collect new recipes feverishly. Blueberry cheesecake. Mexican casserole: a curious dish made with chicken, mushroom soup and grated cheese with crushed Doritos on top. And the piece de resistance that became a family favourite: chocolate chip cake.Despite the glamour and excitement of this new world, we had moments of homesickness.Another Army family reached out and invited us in. Mrs Thompson provided spreads of such magnificence we still talk about them now, and chocolate chip cake was her signature dish, made with sour cream and dark chocolate chips in a bundt tin, which seemed impossibly elaborate.I demanded the recipe, and I have lost count of how many times I made this cake as a weekend treat for us all. I didn’t need the recipe card in the end. I can recite it in my sleep.I’ve since tried to make it in England and it doesn’t quite work — perhaps the cup sizes are different, or the flour not right. I’m determined one day to play with the ingredients and restore it to its former glory.We left America after five wonderful years and settled into what became the family home in Berkshire. It was the late Seventies, and dinner parties were all the rage.I would hover by my mother as she made poulet au vin and hazelnut gateau, truite Normande and meringue pyramid pudding, longing to be old enough to sit at the table but having to be content with handing around peanuts, then listening to laughter drift up the stairs. If I was lucky, there would be leftovers.By the time I was 15, I was allowed to hold my own dinner parties. I plundered the recipe box for inspiration and added my own inventions.          From left to right: Veronica\u0027s grandmother Edre, Veronica as a baby, great grandmother Milly, and mother Jennifer pictured in 1963My friends would arrive, dropped off by their parents and dressed up to the nines, clutching bottles of Paul Masson wine (these empty bottles graced every kitchen in the Seventies, filled with rice, pasta and kidney beans).Somehow our decadent behaviour was overlooked because the table had been properly laid: a folded napkin and a candlestick covers up many sins!I’d make Hungarian goulash and Marie Biscuit chocolate pudding — a heart-stopping concoction of chocolatey, creamy stickiness.The record player was turned up to ten and everyone stubbed out their cigarettes on their plate. Nowadays, the music would be streamed wirelessly, no one would smoke and the pudding would be vilified for being far too calorific . . .Later, I kept the box alive with my own recipes when I started my own family: I got married in 1989 and soon had three growing boys of my own to feed.There are endless favourites: my signature cassoulet, which has evolved from a scientific trial of every recipe I can find for it.The Coca-Cola cake I make for every child’s birthday, as it’s the easiest and most forgiving cake recipe I’ve ever made — enhanced by the addition of a can of cola instead of sugar, and it never fails, not even when you are desperately trying to organise a party for 20 small boys.The glorious lemon tart which is perfect for picnics. The tarte tatin which always looks a mess, but which is a melting pile of buttery-caramelised apple heaven.Cooking these favourites is my way of holding my family together, whatever the occasion.But I still go back to the recipes of my grandmothers. For my father’s 80th birthday party, I ordered a side of smoked salmon from the village where he’d spent his childhood summers. There was only one thing to eat it with: my grandmother’s soda bread, with cold butter, a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of black pepper.He had all his family around him as we devoured this simple reminder of our heritage, his childhood little did we know that this would be the last time we were all together before he passed away.And now as my older sons, Jake, 27, and Sam, 22, go out in the world and are catering for themselves they phone me up. How do you make crab linguine? How do you get that crispy topping on your fish pie? How much wine should I put into a beef bourguignon?I’m proud they want to know, that they remember what I have made for them, that they want to recreate those meals for their friends.So I’m writing all the recipes they remember on to the remaining few cards in the box, ready to pass on for the next generation.The box is an heirloom, but is more precious than diamonds — for it is food that holds us all together. Recipes remind us who we are and what we all mean to each other.The box on my shelf contains so much more than recipes cards: it contains wisdom, and glamour, and hospitality, and security, and history. But most of all, it contains love.A Family Recipe by Veronica Henry, Orion Books, £7.99."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/22/4C6025CE00000578-0-image-m-16_1526593425730.jpg","title":"Motorists urged clean air conditioning units","story":"    Motorists are being urged to clean the air conditioning units in their cars after researchers found potentially dangerous bacteria living and breeding in systemsSwabs of 15 air conditioning filters were taken from cars across the UK and sent for laboratory analysis.

Bacillus subtilis are normally found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some mammals. They generally do not cause disease but have been known to cause septicaemia in a patient with leukaemia.Bacillus is more dangerous and has links with a wide range of infections including meningitis, abscesses and septicaemia.          Swabs of 15 air conditioning filters were taken from cars across the UK and sent for laboratory analysis. Micro-organisms were detected in all of the filters tested at London Metropolitan UniversityA car’s air con works by mixing fresh air from outside with a refrigerant and the mixture turns into liquid as it is cooled. It is then turned into vapour as it travels through evaporation coils and blown into the cabin as cool air. It is the evaporator in the system that provides perfect conditions for bacteria, mould and fungi to build up and thrive. Although the car filter will prevent many pollutants entering the passenger compartment, it will not stop all micro-organisms.The research was commissioned by Kwik Fit, which urged drivers to clean their air conditioning systems at least once every two years.On average, the test found 1.6 different strains of mico-organisms within the filters.Drivers in Plymouth had the most contaminated cars, with an average of 2.3 varieties of micro-organism per vehicle. Dundee closely followed, with each filter having on average two strains of micro-organism.Coming in just under the overall average figure and at the bottom of the table was Cardiff, with an average of one type of micro-organism per filter tested.Dr Paul Matewele, a senior lecturer specialising in microbiology at London Metropolitan, said: ‘Some of the bacteria found has links to animals, the gastrointestinal tract of humans and some infections that could cause a lot of harm to iniduals, especially those with a compromised immune system.‘The study highlights that air conditioning systems are suitable breeding grounds for bacteria and therefore underlines the importance of cleaning and replacing filters.‘I’m sure if car owners knew what they were blowing out of their air conditioning vents they would think twice before switching them on this summer.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/01/4C6155CF00000578-0-image-m-33_1526603044848.jpg","title":"Latte levy 25p disposable coffee cups moves step closer","story":"A ‘latte levy’ of 25p to discourage the use of disposable coffee cups moved a step closer yesterday as environment minister George Eustice said the Government had an ‘open mind’ about introducing such a charge.A ‘latte levy’ of 25p to discourage the use of disposable coffee cups moved a step closer yesterday as environment minister George Eustice said the Government had an ‘open mind’ about introducing such a charge.The Daily Mail has called for a levy as part of the campaign to turn the tide on plastic debris which pollutes our seas.There are more than 2.5billion plastic cups used each year, but just one in 400 is recycled.The Environmental Audit Committee has suggested a 25p charge would discourage their use – a so-called ‘latte levy’.During a backbench debate yesterday, Mr Eustice said suggestions that the levy idea had been abandoned were incorrect, adding: ‘We do believe this is a very important issue.’ A Treasury consultation on single-use plastics, including coffee cups, closes today.Labour MP Mary Creagh, chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee, has called on the Government to compel manufacturers to make single-use cups fully recyclable or face a ban by 2022.÷ A reverse vending machine offering 10p for every waste plastic bottle is to be available for the first time in the UK at an Iceland store.

That is expected later today.However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.             Prince William is seen leaving Windsor Castle during the final preparations for Saturday\u0027s royal wedding          William and Kate were also photographed leaving Kensington Palace as they joined the couple in Windsor for rehearsalsThe Queen hosts the annual garden party at Buckingham PalaceSpectator pots pool player\u0027s wayward shot with incredible volleyRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportLast British Dambuster flies in a Lancaster bomber cockpitChinese Muslims face terrible conditions in re-education camps\u0027I\u0027m Batman\u0027 declares Michael Keaton at end of commencement speechListen to the voice of the man who says he is D.B.

Staying in the hospital a few more days. Not allowed to get excited\u0027 and his children said he is \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to miss the wedding.Mr Markle said his doctors needed to \u0027go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed\u0027 during the operation.His daughter Samantha, who has a poor relationship with Meghan, claims her father is \u0027upset and alone\u0027 following his surgery.But there is some confusion over his care as sources close to the Markle family said he had already been diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to undergo planned surgery to fit a stent, the same operation Prince Philip underwent in 2011, early next week – on his return from London.It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle.Journalist Sean Mandell said Miss Markle\u0027s father had told him: \u0027It will take a long time to heal.

It was a very warm welcome, an open session and there were a questions on a whole range of topics. “There was one gentleman there who clearly had had, err, a few drinks too many.“And I think he was, ahhh, he was assisted in making an early return home. Which is probably where he should have gone earlier in the evening, as I’m sure he’s worked out by this morning.”Bill Shorten had some sympathy for Turnbull when asked about the incident but also offered some advice.“No one should abuse anyone – it doesn’t matter if it is Malcolm Turnbull or somebody’s grandmother,” he said on a visit to Western Australia.“I also have to say, if you are a politician who doesn’t expect a bit of free advice from the cheap seats, you are dreaming. I know I started off doing these town hall meetings, and I notice Mr Turnbull has adopted a similar style, so perhaps he would be better off to turn the alcohol off. It’s probably best not to serve alcohol during your political events.”Both leaders will continue the unofficial super Saturday byelection campaigns before returning to Canberra for the resumption of parliament on Monday.

I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6606a0950463260aff858263993710f08fb2d89/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb9b95ec996e8af02d0373d4d1bed335","title":"north england got groove back cultural shift","story":"It is a consensus many Londoners may struggle to comprehend, reliably deluded when it comes to outside perceptions of their beloved city. The children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, spent the last year travelling across the north interviewing young people about their hopes and fears for a report called Growing Up North. From Liverpool to Hull, and everywhere in between, she asked children where they saw their future. They agreed on one thing: not London.There were girls in Manchester who fancied living in New York, boys in Bradford who dreamed of one day moving 10 miles up the road to Leeds. But London? No ta. Too expensive, they told her: “Not just in terms of housing but in terms of maintaining your lifestyle.”Longfield senses a cultural shift. When she was growing up in Yorkshire in the 1970s, like so many ambitious northern girls she was set on escaping to the bright lights of the big city. “I went from near Leeds to Newcastle University, straight down the A1 to London,” she told me. I was the same, only in the noughties: Morecambe, Edinburgh, London. Boom. I wanted to be a journalist and all the best media jobs were in the capital. All my favourite northern bands had already moved down. I wanted to be there, propping up the bar at the Good Mixer and all the other mythical venues I’d been reading about in the NME.Now, when I give careers talks to students, the question I get asked most is: “Do you think I’ll have to move to London?” Not: “I really want to”, but: “Do I have to?” I see very few Dick Whittingtons and a lot more London refuseniks, unwilling to leave their nice lives in YorkSunderlandLancaster for a slightly bigger salary. After all, who cares if you’re on an extra £10k if you still can’t afford your own place and it can take an hour and a half to visit someone in the same city?There’s an arrogance to Londoners that turns the rest of the country right off. On the bank holiday weekend I was in the capital and did a parkrun in Croydon. Afterwards, I got chatting to a local who boasted that it was the hardest and hilliest such event in the country. I expressed scepticism, pointing out that there were courses in the Lake District that would make Croydon look like Holland. “That doesn’t count,” he said.Last week the trade secretary, Greg Hands, Tory MP for Chelsea, said Reading had been chosen as the new home for the Trade Remedies Authority because it was “well connected to whole of UK”. Tell that to businesses in Liverpool or Leeds, who will face a seven-hour round trip to get there.I moved from London to Greater Manchester five years ago, despite many warnings that I was heading straight into a career cul-de-sac. But what price a garden? Stairs? A spare room? I also thought the media had become unforgivably London-centric and I wanted to play a tiny part in challenging the capital’s dominance. Sometimes that just means pointing out that sun is forecast for Manchester when our lead story suggests the nation is about to be laid waste by a snow storm other times it has meant reporting from what we now see as the Brexit heartlands, warning that leaving the EU was a very real prospect, however fanciful it looked from London.There is no doubt that many of the top jobs remain in the capital. But for how long? In the media alone, 3,200 BBC employees are now based in Salford, and Channel 4 recently announced plans for a “second home” outside London. The year 2016 marked a pivotal moment, when more graduate jobs were created in Manchester than in the City of London: 3,790 compared with 3,545 in the Square Mile, according to Charlie Ball of graduate career-monitoring service Prospects. Ball expects Leeds and Glasgow to overtake the City in terms of graduate jobs in the next few years.Should we thank the former chancellor George Osborne and his “northern powerhouse”? His successor may be too busy with Brexit to put much money or energy into the project – but some Whitehall functions are already devolved. Cities like Manchester are able to make their case stronger than ever before, luring incomers with Tony Wilson’s old adage that “this is Manchester. We do things differently here.”Of course London has never been cheap: “Nothing is certain in London except expense,” wrote the 18th-century poet, William Shenstone. But a one-bedroom flat where I used to live in Clapton, east London, nowhere near a tube stop, now sells for almost half a million pounds.Is it any a surprise that so few artists now live in the capital? Lubaina Himid, last year’s Turner prizewinner, works happily from a Georgian terrace in Preston. IAMDDB, one of the most hotly tipped musicians on the BBC’s Sound of 2018 list, is so in love with her native Manchester that she quotes its dialling code like a rhapsody: “0161, that’s home, and will be home for ever.” Blossoms, one of the most successful indie bands on the circuit, are named after their favourite pub in their native Stockport.Meanwhile, in Chris Grayling we have a transport secretary who cancelled key electrification projects to northern rail lines last year while supporting Crossrail\u0026nbsp2 – yet another rail line across London, expected to cost £31.2bn, which just happened to start in his own Surrey constituency. And is it not a bit rum that the transport minister, Jo Johnson, is also minister for London?I know many Londoners blame the north for Brexit, even though Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds voted remain. One sent me a petition to sign in the aftermath, calling for London’s independence. But is it that much of a surprise that, after so many decades of underinvestment from Westminster, the rest of the country saw the EU referendum as a chance to give London a kicking?

Here, experts point a better way forwardIf you’re one to put hours into revising for an exam only to be disappointed with the results, then you may need to rethink your revision methods. You could be wasting time on inefficient techniques, says Bradley Busch, a registered psychologist and director of InnerDrive. “You get people putting in lots of effort, but not in a directed way,” he says. Here are some of the common ways students unwittingly waste study time, and what experts recommend you do instead.Re-reading and highlighting notes may feel like work, but it often won’t achieve much. The same goes for spending hours drawing up a revision timetable. Instead, psychologists recommend a technique called retrieval practice. This is anything that makes your brain work to come up with an answer. It can include doing quizzes, multiple choice tests, and past papers. “To really learn something, you’ve got to transfer information from working memory into long term memory, where you can store and later retrieve it,” says David Cox, a neuroscientist and journalist. “Committing something to long term memory isn’t easy, so it shouldn’t feel easy.”Beware of the planning fallacy, which is our tendency to underestimate how much time we really need to do something. It leads to sitting outside the exam hall with two hours to spare, desperately cramming. This is not an effective way to learn. “The information you gain quickly, you can lose quickly too,” says Busch.The opposite of cramming is spacing, which is the practice of spacing out your revision over time, doing little and often. So one hour a day for seven days is better than cramming seven hours into one day, for example. It’s also good to incorporate interleaving into your revision. This is a fancy way of saying you should mix up your subjects during a revision session. “It forces you to think about the problem and the strategy you come up with,” says Busch.Sifting through the recommended study playlists on Spotify, trying to work out which songs will help you to concentrate, is usually a waste of time. But while listening to music can help you relax, and some students may have “trained” themselves to concentrate with it on, it’s still better to study in silence, Cox says. “You’re never going to be as productive having music on in the background, because it’s preventing your brain from acting at maximum capacity.”We may check our phones as often as once every 12 minutes. Obviously, this is a major distraction. That’s not all: research has shown that just having your phone in sight when you revise is enough to negatively affect your concentration, even if you don’t use it. And it’s a common trap to fall into. “I usually have my phone on silent mode, but to be honest, if it’s there I always check it,” says Chiara Fiorillo, who studies at City, University of London. Ideally it’s best to banish your phone to another room altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329c4ae52e322aed14145b4dec29f037b7a68775/0_126_3426_2056/master/3426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=434221af4c5ed9cf3d748fd99e28eb73","title":"napa valley wine measure c agriculture","story":"Industry insiders and local environmentalists fear agricultural development has become untenable, threatening the valley’s futureby  Charlotte Simmonds in Napa ValleyThe rise of Napa began with an upset. Warren Winiarski would know – his wine, a cabernet sauvignon, was a firm underdog at a legendary 1976 blind tasting in Paris, which pitted the best of France against the little-known California region.His winery, Stag’s Leap, shocked the wine world by taking top honors. “It broke the glass ceiling that France had imposed on everyone,” he recalls. “People’s aspirations were liberated.”Today Winiarski, 89, is speaking not of liberation, but of limits. A growing coalition of industry veterans and longtime residents fear that Napa has become a victim of its own success, pointing to the ecological transformation of the valley floor from dense oak woodland to a sea of vine-wrapped trellises. And they are posing a thorny question: has a unique agricultural region reached a tipping point at which agriculture itself becomes the threat?“We’re not thinking ahead,” says Winiarski. “What’s at stake is a national treasure.”Against this backdrop, a local environmental initiative has sparked fierce debate. The effort, known as Measure C, would cap the amount of oak woodland that could be cleared for future vineyards – in effect limiting the growth of some of the world’s most famous wine brands.Napa Valley is small, just 30 miles long and five miles wide. Nearly 500 wineries now call this slim stretch home it welcomes 3.5 million visitors a year. Global recognition has attracted big beverage companies. Tourists have clogged the narrow two-lane roads. Wealthy “lifestyle vintners” have scooped up second homes and attempted to build private helicopter pads. “With great success came great money and outsiders,” explains James Conaway, a journalist and author who has been covering Napa since the 1980s. He describes the valley of 30 years ago as egalitarian and idealistic, a mixed agricultural community that raised wine alongside livestock and fruit trees. “Now it’s monoculture with a vengeance. Hundreds of miles of steel trellising holding up the vines from one end of the valley to the next. It has an industrial sheen.”Through the windows at Winiarski’s hilltop home, the transformation can be surveyed with ease. Vineyards stretch in all directions, rows of green as orderly as soldiers. The Silverado Trail, a famous wine tasting route, cuts a path to the west. To the east lie hills covered in oaks – trees that, Winariski points out, once carpeted the valley floor. Napa’s oaks have become a flashpoint in the story of wine’s takeover. Ninety-five per cent of those on the valley floor have been felled, the vasty majority replaced by grapes. Now developers are eyeing the surrounding hillsides. Napa county has California’s densest concentration of oak woodland, thanks to the rich foliage that still carpets the hills. While much of it is privately owned and not public land in the classic sense, the woods are regarded as a public resource – a place of recreation and bioersity, a vital part of the valley’s watershed and a fierce point of pride. But more than a third sits on potentially agriculturally productive soil – a 2010 management plan estimated that by 2030, up to 3,065 acres of mixed woodland would be lost due to vineyard development.“Forests are the best negative emissions technology we have,” says Jim Wilson, a former brewing quality manager at Anheuser-Busch and a leader in the band of grassroots activists behind Measure C. “Should Napa’s wine industry get a pass?”The measure is the culmination of years-long battle – one that’s involved knocking on doors, gathering thousands of signatures, and fighting an opposition which, according to a private newsletter seen by the , plans to spend nearly $1m to defeat it. Wilson’s side, by contrast, has raised just over $160,000. The effort has consumed his life, but then, Napa is his life.“I was born here in 1955,” Wilson says. “I raised a family on my wife’s ranch.” Their home – a patchwork of steep hills, creeks and woodlands on the county’s east side – is wild and uncultivated. During a walk beneath the oaks on a recent morning, his love for the forest is palpable. “When you take forest out, you negatively impact carbon sequestration,” he explains. The trees play a crucial role in capturing rain and replenishing groundwater, he said, while their root systems prevent soil erosion. Voters will decide on the proposal by 5 June, but the campaign has sharply ided the wine community. Veteran vintners like Winiarski have gone against the industry trade groups, who are united in their opposition. The Napa Valley Vintners, a key trade body, initially supported the measure but later pulled a surprise U-turn. Wilson and his co-organizers say pressure from powerful industry figures turned the tide. The Vintners declined to comment on the reversal, but an official statement said the majority of its members “conveyed opposition”.“This decision does not change our longstanding commitment to promoting, protecting and enhancing the Napa Valley and to upholding its goals of advocating for the local wine industry while preserving this special place for future generations,” it added.Ryan Klobas, the policy director for the Napa Valley Farm Bureau, warns the measure is “full of unintended consequences” and calls its proposed regulation too complicated for voters to grasp. “You’re asking everyone to become a technical expert overnight. This is an issue better left to the board of supervisors.”But longtime residents such as Ginny Simms – an environmental advocate who served on the county’s board of supervisors in the 1970s – believe corporate greed is at the root. Napa today is a multibillion-dollar industry, where global beverage companies such as Treasury Wine Estates, Gallo, and Constellation – which own brands such as Corona and Svedka vodka – have acquired smaller wineries for their portfolios.“The real issue here is power,” says Simms, 90. “Opponents want to run the county in a way that is favorable to the expansion of all wineries and wine events. Which leaves the people of Napa voiceless.”Despite the talk of pushing back against power, some worry more regulation would actually favor the wealthy by boosting the price of the little free land that remains. Don Clark is a mid-sized grape grower and vineyard manager from Texas, who came to Napa in 1994 and was lucky to buy affordable land.“We may have been the last generation who could come here as a young farmer,” he says. “The barriers to entry are almost impossible now.” Startup costs have soared – Clark’s last vineyard development client spent half a million dollars on various legal, consultation and county fees, as well as archeological and environmental studies, he says.Clark and others point to a landmark 1968 ordinance known as the Agriculture Preserve – the first of its kind in the US – which deemed agriculture the “highest and best” use of Napa’s land. Measure C therefore undercuts a fundamental right to farm, these opponents argue. But proponents say the measure is born of love, not reproach, for the wine world, and is simply about responsible farming. “Something’s very wrong with the way we are thinking about our resources,” Winiarski says. “They are finite. And yet we go on with development as though we could do that indefinitely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba98e3626dd2432cacdb114c0e28ed138824acb/0_93_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba35c40ac94f7105443832002ee1f69c","title":"grace joness greatest looks a 70th birthday celebration in pictures","story":"Often with a hat – and never without a degree of controversy – as she enters her eighth decade, we pick out the landmark outfits of her 40-year career "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86586481591e801e50812036724e9c92bc30c05b/189_0_5617_3372/master/5617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=133c88990fde5cdd69012c5806283ea1","title":"does lars von triers vomitive new film spell the end for provocative cinema","story":"There was a mass walkout at the Cannes premiere of von Trier’s The House that Jack Built. From A Clockwork Orange to Driller Killer, cinema has always courted controversy – but could we be entering a more cautious age?There is a stampede to get into The House That Jack Built and then, not long after, there is a stampede to get out. At the morning screening of the new Lars von Trier film at Cannes, I try to keep tabs on the number of mass walkouts. The first occurs when Matt Dillon’s bug-eyed psychopath sticks a kitchen knife in a breastbone the second when a serene little boy cuts the leg off a duckling. I think the third might take place during the shooting at a picnic, although, by this point, I confess I am slightly losing track. On screen, Dillon’s character embarks on a lengthy discourse about wine – and, for some reason, this scene provokes a mass exodus of its own. Has the wine-making speech thrown these filmgoers a lifeline? It is barely 10 in the morning and they are running away to get loaded.If one had to dramatise Von Trier’s recent history at the Cannes film festival, it could play as a series of entrances and exits, like a Feydeau farce without the laughs. The director walks into the press conference and jokes that he is a Nazi. The festival declares him persona non grata and has him bundled out. The director walks in with his comeback production. The public recoils, turns its back and walks off. One hundred invited guests reportedly absconded from Monday night’s world premiere, and a similar number exited the press screening on Tuesday. The House That Jack Built (a metaphysical serial-killer tale, constructed along similar lines to his previous film, Nymphomaniac) has been variously described as “vomitous”, “disgusting” and “irredeemably unpleasant”. Entertainment reporter Roger Friedman called it a “vile movie” that “should never have been made”. Except that, wouldn’t you know it, Friedman bailed out before the end, too.Cannes normally loves a good scandal, but this year it feels different. The festival is nervous, chastened, still struggling to accommodate the #MeToo movement and adapt to a crumbling business model that has led pundits to question the festival’s relevance. Or maybe it is reflecting the culture as a whole.Film used to thrive on controversy and danger. These days, it has had its shadowy corners exposed. Tastes are changing, a new morality bites and cinema’s underground beasts find they have fewer places to hide. Increasingly, it seems, the provocateur is being shown the door.It is almost enough to make you nostalgic for the bad old days of “satanic” Kenneth Anger with his Scorpio Rising, Herschell Gordon Lewis (AKA “the Godfather of Gore”) and the incorrigible Russ Meyer, who peddled a personal interest in women’s breasts into a lucrative career totalling 23 feature film credits.Cinema is a broad church that caters to all tastes. But it began its life as circus sideshow, on the magic-lantern and peepshow circuit of the late-19th century, and a disreputable pedigree has defined it ever since. So it is a thrill-seeker’s medium, a peddler of sensation, always best enjoyed under cover of darkness.Or rather, it was until recently, before the advent of Netflix and smartphones and the white noise of social media. Once upon a time, underground cult films were consumed by the faithful, produced for the particular taste of a small diehard audience and often fiendishly difficult to find (which only added to their talismanic dimensions). Andy Warhol’s movies, such as Flesh and Trash (actually directed by Paul Morrisey) were projected as artworks in galleries. Abel Ferrara’s grisly Driller Killer and Ms 45 crowned him the king of the New York grindhouse scene. And John Waters’ early shockers (Mondo Trasho, Pink Flamingos) were shot for the amusement of a small cohort of pals down in Baltimore, many of whom doubled up as his cast. I remember plucking Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre from the top shelf of a garage’s DVD rack where it sat alongside all the other video nasties. It was a simpler age.“I have worked really hard on staying in my own little place,” Von Trier told me after his ill-starred Cannes premiere. “But then the world comes along and collides with it, like atomic particles or something.”Therein lies the issue. These days the market is atomised, open to all, and everyone is drinking from the same water fountain – be it the dirty-mac crowd or chin-stroking students, innocent passersby or hapless little kids browsing on a laptop. (God forbid that they should Google “duckling legs” from now on.) We can stream a feature on our phone on the bus and then tweet our outrage to the masses while the infernal movie is still playing. Film is more public and exposed than it ever was in the past. Small wonder its content is being held to account.Repulsed by movie violence? Then steer clear of the screens. Cinema has always done violence, from the early silent westerns right through to the present day. It is just that it is now rated more prohibitively than it was in the freewheeling 1970s, when a furore erupted over instances of reported copycat violence following screenings of Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange. Yet the film was only yanked from circulation after the director stepped in to do it himself.As for Von Trier, he is no stranger to violence (exhibit A: the infamous clitoris scene from Antichrist) and yet the male-on-female brutality in his latest work has had many people calling time on his whole career.How about sex? That has been there from the start, the original sin largely consensual but occasionally not. And what was first viewed as good sex is now seen rather differently. Take the case of Bernardo Bertolucci’s Last Tango in Paris – for so long defended as a jaundiced 70s classic, now widely reviled after the revelation that its star Maria Schneider (who always claimed that the film made her feel “a little raped”) was tricked into performing its most notorious scene. Or even a film as mainstream as The Breakfast Club, which its star Molly Ringwald rewatched recently, only to realise that a scene that had been framed as harmless flirtation was in fact a violation. And it is this level of scrutiny that helps to keep the films (and ourselves) honest. There are still too many bad apples passing themselves off as fresh.But that’s the trouble with scandals: they tend to shade towards darkness. The Cannes film festival, for instance, has always run the full gamut. I’m tempted to put a film such as The House That Jack Built (or The Brown Bunny, or Irreversible, or Elle) at the lighter end of the spectrum, in that these are basically pinatas thrown out to the crowds. But the festival has weightier, uglier matters to contend with as well. In this, its year of reckoning, it is belatedly moving to tackle a culture of entrenched sexism, clearing space in the schedule for talks on the importance of gender equality and a march of 82 women (jury president Cate Blanchett among them) to the steps of the Palais. It’s also weaning itself off a poisonous co-dependent relationship with Harvey Weinstein, who once presided over this court like a debauched Henry VIII. And here, perhaps, is where a level confusion sets in. Cannes’ current set of problems may well be commingled. But in mounting a clean-up, it risks throwing out brattish babies alongside the dirty bathwater.One can see how it happens. The festival runs for 11 days every May. Along the way, it finds room for hundreds of movies and thousands of guests. It sits lofty artists alongside crooks and charlatans. It turns the red carpet over to Iranian art-house one night and Hollywood drek the next and tends to oversee these frivolities with a blithe disregard, like a half-deaf governess at a Just William party. It makes no logical sense it pulls in too many directions at once. But the tug of war provides dramatic tension. And without these contradictions the event is bound to fall flat.Which brings us back to Von Trier, a man who appears to hop between apple barrels, by turns genius and monster, utterly captivating and frequently insufferable. He won the Palme d’Or in 2000 and typically competes for the big prizes. This time he is playing out on the sidelines, away from the press, like a misogynistic old uncle who can’t be brought out in public (an image, it must be said, that is not helped by his association with a producer – Peter Aalbaek Jensen – who recently confessed that he “liked slapping arses”. Not long ago, Von Trier gave the festival its spice, rolling into town to unveil dastardly fare such as Dancer in the Dark and Dogville. Now the man’s very presence amounts to a platforming issue.Inside the Palais, down at the beachfront, I have heard The House That Jack Built described as an act of self-immolation, or even some vile act of vengeance on the festival that once loved him. There is no appetite for the film and the first reviews have been scathing. The consensus is clear. Von Trier is no longer welcome in the new, cleaned-up Cannes. He is too much of an idiot, too much of a risk, too obvious a throwback to the event’s bad old days. Is there also a consensus on the best way to kill film? I think it might be to shoot it by consensus.As it happens, I found myself gripped by The House That Jack Built. It is enraging and irresponsible, brilliant and bold, an outrageous joke shouted out of the abyss. But all of that is beside the point. If I loathed the picture with a passion, I would still want it included. Von Trier needs cinema and cinema needs him right back.No doubt about it, the film industry’s in a mess. The mood at Cannes this year has been nervous, uncertain, while there remain so many changes the organisers still need to make. The festival needs more women in the main competition (and chances are it can only do that if the industry moves first). It has to find space for a fresh generation of film-makers and make peace with the fact that its days as a crucial Oscar springboard are now done. But this, I’m afraid, is not all that’s required.What, after all, do we look for in a film? Is the best movie the one that soothes us, reassures us that basically tells us what we already know, but manages to do so in novel and entertaining new ways? If so, fair enough. But for cinema to remain valid, it needs the counterweight, too: some hard shadow to make the light glow more brightly. It needs films that challenge and disturb, that appal and revolt that have us bolting towards the exit in search of a stiff drink at 10am. In these troubled times, of course, there is a natural urge to play safe. But it is at such anxious moments that we need the provocateurs most of all.Cometh the hour, cometh the idiot. This is the very worst year for Von Trier to be in Cannes. Which is another way of saying that it is the absolute best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b7a92c2e3debcff6b216b6fb94a62a5e08e79/456_294_1933_1160/master/1933.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8318398df41c946c404a54b5fe2873b","title":"arsene wenger interview emptied desk arsenal mikel arteta","story":"In his first major interview since leaving Arsenal the manager discusses his future, not being consulted over his successor and whether Mikel Arteta has the qualities for the jobArsène Wenger is finishing his breakfast in the Paris hotel where he has been coming for years and where the staff would not dream of addressing him in any other way than Monsieur Wenger, pronounced in hushed tones that convey the respect in which this grand man of world football is held in his native land.Dressed in slacks and an open-neck dark blue shirt, the man we must now refer to as the former Arsenal manager has treated himself to a mini pain aux raisins and, having finished his tea (no milk, no sugar), moved on to an espresso. In a sign that he is, perhaps, starting to let himself go just a tiny little bit, he continues spreading raspberry jam on a slice of bread (no butter) as we prepare to look back over his 22 years running one of the world’s top clubs.Typically from a man who has always been more interested in tomorrow than yesterday, Wenger begins with thoughts on his future. As we sit together for his first major interview since leaving Arsenal, the Huddersfield game – the last of his 1,235 matches in charge of the Gunners – is fresh in his mind.“It’s just too soon to know what I will do next,” he says. “I haven’t even emptied my desk yet and in a way I am still in a state of shock. I am going to give myself until June 14, the day the World Cup begins, to decide. The question is do I still want to coach, to be on the bench, or is it time to take up different functions? The one thing I can say for sure is that I will continue to work.“But do I want to continue to suffer as much? I want to continue to defend my ideas of football, that’s for sure. Spontaneously, I would say I still want to coach but I can’t really say that yet for sure.”Wenger has not stopped working for 34 years. In a time when managers are taking sabbaticals and the average  for a Premier League manager stands at less than two seasons, he has had no time off since he became the Nancy manger in 1984. With that in mind and no need, financially, to work another day, isn’t it time to put his feet up?“I have friends who can go and lay on a beach all day long for the whole of their holidays and I envy them,” he says with a grin. “I just can’t do that. I get bored. I need to be doing something. I need a challenge. I have lived and breathed football all these years and it’s a passion – I can’t imagine doing anything else. That’s why in a way this is an exciting moment for me, too. I have a new page, a blank page in front of me. As all good writers know, that can be a time of anguish but I hope I won’t have too much of that. It’s also a chance to write new chapters.”Talking football with Wenger is like having a living encyclopedia on hand. He has attended every major international tournament for as far back as he can remember and he will be at the World Cup as a pundit for beIN Sports, working for the Middle East and French channels when he is not flitting from game to game with his old friend David Dein. I have had the good fortune to accompany him on some of those travels and to work alongside him on some of those shows. Wenger is a dream for a TV host because he has a remarkable memory for games and players, an opinion on everything and often thinks differently to those around him. He is also much funnier than he might let on.During Euro 2016, for example, when he was working alongside big personalities such as Ruud Gullit, Marcel Desailly, Luis Fernández and Christian Vieri, each time I went into the green room to check on them it was invariably Wenger spinning the yarns and telling the jokes. When we finished the show each day with a football quiz, Wenger was just as competitive and playful as the other pundits, even joining celebrations with the studio audience and leading Mexican waves. In recent days the waves have been to say goodbye, and farewell. The outpourings of warmth at Arsenal but also at Old Trafford and Huddersfield moved the 68-year-old.“It was very touching to see,” Wenger says. “It has been a strange period – switching from contestation to unanimity in just a few days. Surprising, but quite nice also. I have the impression people wanted to salute my longevity, my fidelity to my club and perhaps the ideas about football I always tried to defend. I take it as a sign of recognition for the total commitment I have always had towards values I hold dearly – the desire to play dynamic, attacking football with a certain idea of how to go about it, too.“My type of loyalty probably doesn’t exist any more. Maybe the dinosaur I became was the last symbol of times that have changed. We are today in a society which is so quick to reject. There is no time to build, to construct, always this demand for results immediately. Maybe people wanted to manifest that too.“It was nice to see some of the recognition, I admit. When I arrived, you know, I was a complete unknown and I have always had the impression I am representing my country in a way. In a land where there has always been so much animosity between the English and the French I am proud to have achieved certain things and perhaps to have opened doors for other French coaches. Don’t forget, when I arrived in England a foreign manager was a very rare thing.”Although Wenger does not want to go into detail, he admits to having received many job offers. In France many imagine him as a natural fit for the Qatar-built project at Paris Saint-Germain. The club recently confirmed Thomas Tuchel as the next manager but Wenger is seen as an ideal chief executive.“I have had no discussions with them recently, I can tell you that in all honesty,” he says. “I have always been close to those in charge of PSG – I advised them to buy the club because I was convinced there were great things that could be done in a city which loves football. They have worked well and made a good start. I think people are too hard on them, too demanding. PSG just won all four national trophies in France and it’s not enough, apparently. But you cannot build a club with the idea that if you don’t win the Champions League then it’s a failure.”Although Wenger’s advice was sought by the owners of PSG, his opinions on what should happen next at Arsenal were not solicited. Where Sir Alex Ferguson named his successor, Wenger will be a spectator of future events at the Emirates.“At least that way they can’t blame me if there are bad results in the future,” he says with a laugh. “They didn’t ask me to be involved in that process. So I will let them choose the manager and afterwards I will support him, whoever it is.”Mikel Arteta’s name has oft been cited. What does he make of that? “I don’t want to influence that decision – it’s important they make their choice in an objective way and I don’t want anything I say to be misconstrued,” Wenger says. “I know how you do these things – if I say something nice about somebody you will say I am backing him but this is not the case. For Arteta, does he have all the qualities to do the job? Yes. He was a leader and he has a good passion for the game and he knows the club well. He knows what is important at the club and he was captain of the club. So why not? But whoever they choose I will support.”Before Wenger decides his future he must return to his office and clear out his things say a final goodbye to Arsenal. “I am an emotional man and it will be, perhaps, an emotional time but I will look around and see that life goes on. There will be youngsters training and playing and that will be a reminder of the passion I have for this game and my role as an educator. When you’re a young boy you have a dream and to fulfil that dream you need attitude and talent but you also need someone to give you a chance.“I grew up in a village and I met my first coach at the age of 19. But when I was 12, 13, 14 my dream was to meet somebody who would tell me how to play football. I was lucky – it didn’t stop me from making my life in the game but many don’t get that chance. As coaches we can change peoples’ lives, influence lives, and part of that is giving an opportunity to young players. That is one of the most beautiful things you can do.”We realise it is almost time for lunch and the French don’t mess with that. Just time for Wenger to take a photo with a young fan who tells him it’s perhaps the most beautiful day of his life, to sign the Arsenal shirt he is handed and stride off, destination unknown.

Gareth Southgate spoke with logic and humour but, most of all, he left the unmistakable sense that England’s manager may know a bit more about this level of football than some people realise. “The only thing that bothers me is that everybody keeps asking me about the pressure,” he said. “That’s when I start to think: ‘Bloody hell, maybe I’m not seeing what it should be’. If I felt underprepared, if we were not ready and we’d spent the last 10 days flapping about who should be in, I would probably feel more anxious.”Instead, he and his staff have held a meeting every Monday to discuss his World Cup squad, the various back-up options and all the logistics of preparing for a major tournament. Small details, in many cases, right down to whether the players should avoid the “misery” of Twitter and inviting a psychologist to join them in Russia. Dr Pippa Grange, who will travel with the squad, has presumably been warned to expect some resistance from one or two players. To quote Jamie Vardy when Leicester City did something similar: “There’s no point putting a psychologist in front of me because he won’t get inside my head.”The players will meet on Sunday but, first things first, Southgate has given them permission to go on holiday this week with no rules attached. Was that a risk bearing in mind some of the headlines England’s footballers have attracted before other tournaments? “Before Euro 96 I had three days in Magaluf with Aston Villa,” Southgate explained, “so it would be a bit hypocritical for me to discuss what the correct preparation was. Everything in a footballer’s life these days is ‘fill this bloody form in’. There’s a danger we overfill them with professionalism and doing the right thing. They need a switch-off and I don’t see an issue. I’m not interested in what they do over the next few days.”Southgate kept his memories of Magaluf to himself but there was a giveaway smile. “I went for a run on a couple of mornings,” he said. “Though it might have been a run back home, rather than a ‘run’.”To put it another way, the England manager intends to take the unusual step of treating his players like adults. Again, it’s the small details, such as allowing them to leave England’s base camp in Repino to visit St Petersburg without feeling the need to call out a search party.Other managers would impose curfew times or restrict access to mobile phones. “I don’t like loads of rules,” Southgate countered. “The players are responsible enough, they know what’s expected. Sometimes, if they have their phones that means they spend time together, looking at videos and interacting. If they haven’t, they just rush back to their rooms.”In Fabio Capello’s days as manager, the Football Association issued an official code of conduct rationing the time players spent on video or computer games, as well as banning them from making comments on social media unless it was authorised. Quietly, that has been abolished under Southgate’s tenure. He will, however, warn his players that Twitter can be an instant mood-killer. “Personally I’m not sure there’s value to reading the comments that come in,” he said. “It comes back to what creates pressure, or what creates misery, in your life. Generally, there’s a lot of social media that can be negative, so why invite that into your life?”Nobody pointed out there was more just one dissenter after Southgate had named his squad earlier in the week. Yet the England manager did not show a flicker of self-doubt when it came to explaining his choices and, though he was tactful not to say anything that could be construed as overly critical, there were various clues when it came to the players who had been left out.All the great teams, he said, from Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s, to Milan in the 1990s and the modern Manchester City, had “athleticism, energy and pace”. He wanted his team to press the opposition, he added, and hunt down the ball. Listening to this little speech, it felt clear why Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey were considered only briefly.The explanation for Shelvey’s omission concluded with a mention of checking the “character and personality” of all the players. Southgate reiterated his sympathies for Ryan Bertrand and insisted the door was still open for Joe Hart if the goalkeeper found a new club next season and returned to form. Not so much Chris Smalling, though, after being excluded because Southgate wanted England’s centre-halves to be better on the ball. “We made that decision in November and I’ve not seen any reason to change the thinking,” he said.For someone who was once considered too gentlemanly to make the really tough calls, Southgate has quietly taken a sledgehammer to a number of international careers. For that, there were no apologies, just the clear impression that he was happy with his choices and not willing to bend for anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec26544eb42e1a5818b195322374eacb8e65484e/180_541_2566_1539/master/2566.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37faf388bfe4ea306a9f41f77e39de12","title":"mourinho conte manchester united chelsea midfield fa cup final","story":"“I’m not,” José Mourinho said after Manchester United’s home win over Liverpool in March, “the kind of mechanic coach that says player A pass to player B, player B pass to player C and player C to player D. I’m much more a supporter of preparing the players to decide well and feel the game.”As so often with Mourinho, there was perhaps a coded jibe this may have been (it’s very hard to know for sure with a man whose every utterance is subjected to intense scrutiny) another sortie in his protracted war of words with Antonio Conte. For the Italian is a manager who has his side practise “automations”, as Eden Hazard calls them. Conte does see the value in practising set moves, to be deployed during games when the disposition of players on the pitch is right.The notion of planned moves is common in modern football and has a history stretching back at least as far as Valeriy Lobanovskyi. His great collaborator Anatoliy Zelentsov compared them to gambits in chess, pre-formed strategies to be adapted and applied in game situations. In football, the advantage is obvious: if players know where they should be moving, who is likely to be in space and where the ball should be played, everything is speeded up. The devastating counterattacks of Joachim Löw’s Germany, particularly at the 2010 World Cup, are a more recent example.Mourinho thinks those preset moves are overly prescriptive and that, in a game as random as football, they can be counterproductive. He prefers to inculcate in his players the mindset to make the best decisions in any situation. There is no right or wrong answer. Those sides who prefer automations are perhaps a little quicker, those who have been imbued with the appropriate mindset more plastic, more versatile.The dig was in the use of the word “mechanic”. Conte had described Mourinho as “making cinema”, in the way he used press conferences to deflect and shape the story around games this was Mourinho’s reply. Perhaps he was a director, an artist but rather that than being bluntly functional, than being mechanistic.There is an irony there in that Conte, whose footballing method involves practising set moves was attacking Mourinho for taking the same approach into his dealings with the media, for “preparing to have a cinema in the press conference”, whereas he was more spontaneous, more willing to react to circumstance.Beyond the rabbit hole of mind games and abstract arguments about how best to condition players, the key to Saturday’s FA Cup final looks likely to be how the midfields match up. Conte’s experiment with a 3‑5‑1‑1, which placed undue pressure on Hazard as the creative hub, looks to have been abandoned, and he will probably set up in the 3-4-2-1 with which they won the title last season.The danger of that approach was seen in the sides’ meeting at Old Trafford in February when Chelsea, having taken the lead, were overrun and could have lost by far more than 2-1. Although Hazard and – probably – Willian operating in those inside-forward positions can drift into areas that are extremely difficult for opponents to pick up, if they become detached from the play, it can lead to the two deeper-lying midfielders – most likely N’Golo Kanté and Cesc Fàbregas – being overwhelmed by the three central midfielders in United’s 4-3-3.That is a particular issue if the wing-backs who could otherwise have helped out in midfield are forced back by United’s wide forwards, probably Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard, making runs into the space behind them. That would also free up United’s full-backs, allowing them to get forward or, more likely, offer support in negating Willian and Hazard.It’s mark of Chelsea’s decline this season that it seems natural to view the game from a perspective of how United are likely to unsettle them. Last season, there would have been confidence that their press, plus the defensive screen offered by Kanté and Nemanja Matic, would have meant it was United’s wide forwards being driven back by the wing-backs Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso. There would have been concerns as to whether United’s flanking midfielders could offer sufficient support to their holding player to handle Hazard and Willian.Although United beat Chelsea in April 2017 at Old Trafford, they lost at Stamford Bridge earlier in the campaign, in the league and FA Cup. An attacking capacity reduced by the sale of Diego Costa and a midfield diminished by the sale of Matic, Chelsea are a much lesser force than they were a year ago. The squad have been weakened by the club’s transfer business, confidence has dropped and, with Conte seemingly certain to leave, there is not the intensity of last season.And that is the difficulty of assessing methodologies, tactical schema and theoretical approaches: there is always something else going on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33711027bde00d5bea14dcdaf7da2dc599e095ef/499_644_7721_4632/master/7721.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ad83d957982447ef172c3d302a4c70e","title":"thomasina miers recipe crab new potato salad salsa macha","story":"A fiery chilli oil made with peanuts and garlic is the perfect accompaniment to this springtime dishSalsa macha is a deliriously delicious chilli oil from Veracruz, a port on the eastern side of Mexico.

Chile de arbol can be found online and in good supermarkets, but substitute with any hot, dried red chilli.500g new potatoes (jersey royals, anya or pink fir apple are great varieties)Salt100ml cider vinegar3 tbsp caster sugar2 large banana shallots, halved and finely sliced6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilThe juice of 2 limes200g dressed crab meat2 bags watercress1 large bunch each of basil and tarragon, leaves pickedFor the salsa macha25g dried red chillies (I use chile de arbol)6 fat garlic cloves25g sesame seeds600ml sunflower oil90g peanuts – raw, untoasted, unsalted 2 tsp sea salt1 tsp caster sugarPut the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with cold water, add a quarter-teaspoon of salt, bring to a boil and cook until tender.Heat the vinegar in a small pan with 100ml water, the sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. When hot, pour this mixture over the shallots and set aside.Now make the chilli oil. De-stem the chillies, discarding any seeds that fall out, and bash the garlic cloves a few times with a heavy object to remove their skins. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a medium heat for four to five minutes until they are a pale gold, then set aside.In a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat, warm 200ml of the oil and add the peanuts and garlic, gently frying until both turn a light caramel colour, (but turn the oil down if it sizzles too much – burning the peanuts, garlic or chillies will make the salsa taste bitter). Pour the oil through a sieve and empty the nuts and garlic into a bowl. Pour the oil back into the pan, add the chillies and fry for one to two minutes, over a medium heat until they darken in colour and smell nutty. Pour in the rest of the oil to stop the cooking and turn off the heat.Grind the sesame seeds in a blender, for a few minutes. Aadd the chilli and garlic, half the peanuts, one teaspoon of salt and the sugar. Blitz to a coarse crumb. Now pour in the oil and blitz for another minute. Add the rest of the nuts, stir well and taste, adding more salt, and a little sugar, if necessary.Cut the potatoes into finger-thick discs and toss in half the olive oil and half the lime juice, then season. Stir the rest of the olive oil and the lime into the crab, and season.Wash and dry the watercress and herbs and arrange on a large platter, with the potatoes on top. Scatter with the crab, the pickled shallots and a little of their vinegar, and drizzle with one to two teaspoons of the salsa macha. Serve with fresh bread and more salsa on the side, for those that want more.The chilli oil does crazily good things to eggs and vegetables – I spoon it over a fried egg for breakfast, or underneath braised green vegetables for supper. It adds a lovely heat to smashed avocadoes, and is great with pasta – try toasted breadcrumbs, anchovies and walnuts. Lastly, try a little of it over slow-roasted summer tomatoes on toast. The leftover pickling liquid from the shallots is great with summer fruits such as raspberries and cherries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac0215ae8a9c1b38d7771c919b7fe1199622655/0_38_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63cd3016c0cc03579de007db1e9d48fd","title":"why do people interrupt it depends on whom youre talking to","story":"A Stanford doctoral candidate found our perceptions differ depending on conversational styles and gender We all know that unpleasant feeling when we’re talking about something interesting and halfway through our sentence we’re interup – “Wait, what’s for dinner?” – pted.But was that really an interruption? Whether or not one person interrupted another depends on whom you ask, according to new research from Stanford’s Katherine Hilton, a doctoral candidate in linguistics.“What people perceive as an interruption varies systematically across different speakers and speech acts,” said Hilton, who is also a Geballe Dissertation Prize Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center. “Listeners’ own conversational styles influence whether they interpret simultaneous, overlapping talk as interruptive or cooperative. We all have different opinions about how a good conversation is supposed to go.”Using a set of carefully controlled scripted audio clips, Hilton surveyed 5,000 American English speakers to better understand what affects people’s perceptions of interruptions. She had participants listen to audio clips and then answer questions about whether the speakers seemed to be friendly and engaged, listening to one another, or trying to interrupt.Hilton found that American English speakers have different conversational styles. She identified two distinct groups: high- and low-intensity speakers. High-intensity speakers are generally uncomfortable with moments of silence in conversation and consider talking at the same time a sign of engagement. Low-intensity speakers find simultaneous chatter to be rude and prefer people speak one at a time in conversation.Hilton also found a gender disparity among survey participants. Male listeners were more likely to view women who interrupted another speaker in the audio clips as ruder, less friendly and less intelligent than men who interrupted.Previous research on interruptions has primarily focused on analyzing recordings of natural conversations. But their results could not be generalizable because every study defines an interruption differently, said Penny Eckert, a Stanford professor of linguistics.“Katherine’s experiment really pulls apart the whole notion of interruption,” Eckert said.For example, when a woman asserts herself in a conversation with a man, is that speaking up or interrupting? While other studies have shown that women tend to be seen more negatively than men if they speak up or interrupt, no one has measured those perceptions quantitatively before, Eckert said.“Gendered ways of talking and interpreting matter, and they have many consequences, including political ones,” said Rob Podesva, an assistant professor of linguistics and Hilton’s adviser. “Katherine’s research shows that there are systematic gender disparities in how we interpret interruptions. Being aware of these disparities may be the first step in figuring out how to address them in the future.”The differences in conversational styles became evident when participants listened to audio clips in which two people spoke at the same time but were agreeing with each other and stayed on topic, Hilton said.The high-intensity group reported that conversations where people spoke simultaneously when expressing agreement were not interruptive but engaged and friendlier than the conversations with pauses in between speaking turns. In contrast, the low-intensity group perceived any amount of simultaneous chitchat as a rude interruption, regardless of what the speakers were saying.“However, these two categories represent extremes on a spectrum,” Hilton said. “In other words, most people are likely to be somewhere in between the two conversational styles.”Hilton also found a significant gender bias among study participants when they listened to audio clips considered highly interruptive by almost all participants. In those clips, interrupters did not just talk at the same time as another speaker, but they also changed the subject or raised their voices.Male listeners were more likely to view a female speaker who interrupted as ruder, less friendly and less intelligent than if the interrupter were male, although both male and female speakers were performing identical scripts in the audio clips, Hilton said.However, female listeners did not show a significant bias in favor of female or male speakers.“Finding this gender bias wasn’t as surprising as the extent of it and the fact that it altered perceptions of a female speaker’s intelligence, which we don’t think of as related to interruptions,” Hilton said.Hilton was curious about how conversations work well before she started studying linguistics. She described her family as incredibly talkative, so growing up, she got used to a high-intensity conversational style.“During my family gatherings everyone would be talking all at once, and it could get pretty chaotic,” Hilton said. “I had to figure out how to navigate that, and I was always interested in who gets to speak when. Who gets to tell their stories and opinions? And who doesn’t? It fascinates me how people can manage all of this complexity without any explicit rules for conversation.”Hilton said she is excited to contribute research that helps shed light on the cognitive, social and cultural aspects of human interaction.“People care about being interrupted, and those small interruptions can have a massive effect on overall communication down the line,” Hilton said. “Breaking apart what an interruption means is essential if we want to understand how humans interact with each other.”Looking for more writing about Stanford’s cutting-edge research from the Stanford News Service?

Staring at Leadsom, who could be seen sitting tensely looking away, he attacked the conduct of government business for which she is responsible.“This is an undesirable state of affairs, and if it were to happen on further occasions, a great many honorable and right honorable members, not to mention interested parties in the opposition day debates outside the chamber, would view it, frankly, as an abuse. I hope that that message is heard loudly and clearly on the government frontbench, at the highest level, by the people in particular by whom it needs to be heard.”At some point during the exchange, Bercow was heard by at least one Tory MP verbally abusing Leadsom, who has been at the forefront of moves to set up channels for dealing with complaints by Commons staff against their MP employers. Leadsom was said not to have heard the comment, but she is a determined campaigner for the protection of the rights of everyone employed by MPs and the House of Commons itself. She has made no secret of the fact that she wanted the new committee set up to investigate complaints to be given the power to look into recent allegations about incidents that had occurred in the past.Wednesday’s exchanges followed a decision the day before by the Commons committee on standards – made up of MPs and non-voting lay members – to block an attempt to launch an investigation into behaviour by Bercow himself. A series of damaging allegations of bullying and intemperate behaviour have emerged in recent months. On Wednesday, the minutes of the committee were published. They revealed the committee chair, the Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron, had said afterwards that lay members, rather than just MPs who might not want to offend the Speaker, should have voting rights.“My own personal view, which has been stated many times over the years, is that it would be highly desirable for parliament to confer full voting rights on lay members – though I recognise that this will probably require primary legislation,” Barron said.The contentious point was that the allegations, involving the treatment by the Speaker of two of his former private secretaries, Angus Sinclair and Kate Emms, had happened early on in Bercow’s term as Speaker, which began nine years ago, and therefore could not be investigated. Bercow has emphatically denied allegations that he bullied Sinclair and Emms. On Thursday, Leadsom appeared to join in the exchanges when she told an MP during business questions complaining about another apparent breach of privilege that no one should be bullied: “I completely agree with the right honorable gentleman’s basic premise that nobody in this place should be bullied and, where we believe that there is wrongdoing, we should be free to investigate it.”Bercow’s supporters believe he is the victim of a sustained campaign by Conservative MPs who feel that he undermines the government. But many Labour MPs regard him as an outstanding supporter of the rights of MPs against the government and see the criticisms of him as politically-motivated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da41afdf2fdf93f6f5efeacdf9aa18975ff6fcb/245_553_2911_1747/master/2911.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db653530395b2b80514eb0d25c2714af","title":"pm set to nominate 10 tory peers in attempt to overcome brexit defeats","story":"Labour peer Lord Adonis criticises plan as desperate attempt by May to boost fragile position in upper chamberTheresa May is expected to approve the creation of about 10 Tory peers and hand at least one to Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party in an attempt to improve her weak position in the House of Lords, which has already voted 15 times against her government over Brexit.The elevations, which are expected to be announced in the coming days in Westminster, were immediately criticised by high profile remain Labour peer Lord Adonis as a desperate attempt by the prime minister to enlist people to boost her fragile position in the unelected upper house.Tories tipped for elevation include former ministers Sir Eric Pickles and Peter Lilley. Adonis said: “This is a classic example of packing the Lords to try and make Brexit easier to endorse.”Constitutionally, there is supposed to be a rough balance between the two main parties in the Lords, although at present there are 244 Conservative peers, including 49 hereditary peers, and 187 Labour peers. However, the Conservatives are far from a majority in a chamber that has a total of 780 members and has become the principal parliamentary opposition to Brexit.That has meant that May’s government has been repeatedly defeated over the EU withdrawal bill, with peers inflicting 15 defeats on issues such as the customs union, the Irish border and removing the precise date of Brexit – 29 March 2019 – from the legislation.Labour is expected to add three peers to its total representation, with the former party general secretary Iain McNicol and Martha Osamor, a race equality campaigner and the mother of MP Kate Osamor, heavily tipped to be ennobled.That prompted a complaint from Adonis, who said it effectively validated the creation of new peers at such a sensitive time. “I’m very surprised that the Labour party is playing this game by agreeing to make a small number of peers because it legitimises the actions of the Tories.”Other Tories who have been tipped for ennoblement include former MPs Andrew Tyrie, Sir Edward Garnier and Julian Brazier.Party political peers are periodically created when No 10 indicates that it wishes to do so, although this round had been delayed for months. In February, May said she wanted to end the “automatic entitlement” to a peerage for holders of high office in an attempt to reduce numbers in the upper house to 600.Former DUP MP William McCrea is expected to be ennobled, taking the Northern Irish party, which props up May’s government in the Commons, from three to four peers. Sources said the party had indicated that it also had been handed the right to make a second nomination.One name believed to be under consideration is Diane Dodds, a DUP MEP who is married to the party’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds. However, a senior DUP source dismissed speculation about Dodds as “complete nonsense”, indicating she was too young to be in the House of Lords.The Liberal Democrats, who have 98 peers in the Lords, are not expected to add to their number."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0f85cc3123b23ac4773b2fb9132ac9b8176b6/0_147_5220_3133/master/5220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94b89a48cc1dd42a4cec16699945518e","title":"how smaller drinks could reduce the uks alcohol consumption","story":"Cutting down drinking is difficult, but could smaller servings of alcohol help? Our study suggests it mightMany of us worry about our drinking and want to cut down, but finding the motivation and willpower to stick to it is hard. But what if we could change our environment so drinking less became the default? Making small changes to the environment to nudge people to behave a certain way (sometimes called choice architecture) can be effective, because a lot of our behaviour happens without conscious deliberations. In our research, we found that reducing the standard serving size of alcohol could do exactly that.Portion sizes of food and alcohol glass sizes have increased over time and these increases have been linked with increased consumption at the population level. Experimental research shows that people eat more if they are served a larger portion of food and do not fully compensate for this by eating less later on. Conversely, reducing the portion size of food decreases how much people eat and people also don’t fully compensate for that. Based on this, we set out to experimentally test the effect of serving size on alcohol consumption. We expected that reducing the serving size of alcoholic drinks would reduce alcohol consumption. “Of course people drink less if you give them less,” I hear you say. But we didn’t look at alcohol consumption from a single drink – we looked over the course of the entire drinking occasion. People were free to drink as many drinks as they wanted and had the opportunity to drink the same total amount in both conditions. In the pub quiz study, participants would have had to drink three smaller drinks to consume the same amount as two standard drinks. But people did not order more drinks to compensate for the reduced serving sizes, and as a result they drank less overall. And there could be substantial health benefits too. We used our results in combination with the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model to estimate that reducing the standard serving size of beer, wine and cider in bars and restaurants by a quarter would lead to 1,400 fewer deaths and 73,000 fewer hospital admissions every year. There are many possible reasons why people might not compensate for reduced servings. It could be that people have a set expectation of the number of drinks they will have, rather than a total volume they aim for in a drinking session. Or maybe they could not be bothered to make more trips to the bar. It is also possible that consuming smaller drinks reduces the amount that seems normal to drink. It is important to find out why people do not seem to compensate, but this does not undermine the importance of the basic effect: if you want people to drink a bit less over a single drinking occasion without restricting the amount that they are allowed to consume, then reduce the serving size. The standard serving size of beer in UK is larger than in many other countries perhaps it is time to offer UK drinkers more options when it comes to buying smaller servings.

Ultimately nothing will change the way I go about my batting. I will look to have that hunger and desire to make really big runs.”Smith stressed it was Root who pushed for the promotion, with the reshuffle chiefly about getting Jonny Bairstow up to No\u0026nbsp5 while still retaining the gloves. Jos Buttler, fresh from a marauding time in the Indian Premier League slots in as a specialist batsman at No\u0026nbsp7 some eight months since his last first-class outing for Lancashire.Root, speaking at the launch of England’s latest New Balance kit, said: “It is really important Jos does not put too much pressure on himself. It is about expressing himself and finding consistency. It is exciting but it might take a bit of time to come right. If he bats for any period of time, especially the way he’s played recently, it’s going to be very exciting.”The second of the two-match series with Pakistan will coincide with Virat Kohli’s arrival for a month-long spell at Surrey. It includes three championship matches against the red Dukes ball for the India captain before his side take on England over five Tests.Root’s verdict? “He’s got to play against Yorkshire at Scarborough so that might get him out of nick. Steve Patterson might nibble him out a couple of times.”In the Royal London Cup, Tom Westley gave a reminder of his ability to the England selectors in Essex’s six-wicket win over Middlesex at Radlett. Westley, who won five Test caps last summer before being omitted for the winter tours, hit 134 and shared a second-wicket partnership of 153 with Varun Chopra as last year’s semi-finalists won with 7.2 overs to spare.Sussex were also comfortable Group B winners with a seven-wicket victory over Kent at Hove. Luke Wells produced a man-of-the-match show as his leg spin helped dismiss Kent for 188, opener Daniel Bell-Drummond the last out for 90 from 115 balls. Wells took two for 30 and then anchored Sussex’s response with 62 from 89 balls.Derbyshire proved too strong for Group A rivals Warwickshire with a 57-run victory at Edgbaston. Captain Billy Godleman hit a career-best 137 from 116 balls as Derbyshire hit 357 for eight.Sam Hain struck a classy 108 in response - his sixth list A century in only 30 games - but he received little support other than an unbeaten 48 from Keith Barker.Leicestershire eased home by 72 runs at Northamptonshire after Paul Horton’s 103 in 126 balls guided them to a challenging 265 for seven.Northants have been badly short of runs so far this season and Gavin Griffiths (4-30) and Ben Raine (3-31) did the damage as the home side slumped to 124 for eight.

The 18-mile sweep is best enjoyed in bite-size chunks, at its many beachside cafesThe notion of a British “beach” conjures up images of sugary sand between your toes, buckets and spades, deckchairs and jauntily painted beach huts. This, I’m afraid, is not the Chesil (in my experience of living in Dorset, fishermen, hikers and even local stick-throwing dog walkers never talk of “Chesil Beach” but simply “the Chesil”).The setting for the film, out this week, of Ian McEwan’s 2007 novel On Chesil Beach is a geological war zone, where the angry, uppity Channel, backed by its mother lode of the wide, deep, lumpy Atlantic, and fuelled by the low pressure-driven predominantly south-westerly winds, throws its kicks and punches at Dorset’s genteel Jurassic coast. The snarling storms of winter hurl rocks at Dorset’s door, howling abuse and emptying their guts on the mat.If you want to get technical, the Chesil is a tombolo, or a tied island. And a very famous tombolo it is too, listed among internationally renowned examples such as Fingal Bay in New South Wales, the Rock of Gibraltar and Shōdo Island, Japan.To really understand the Chesil, you need to understand its relationship to the sea and the land. It is a barrier – made up of pebbles of rounded flint, chert and quartzite – separated from “mainland” Dorset by the Fleet lagoon. It is not a benign, softly spoken sandy place it’s a rugged, scarred, changeling, born out of anger and violence.That doesn’t mean it’s not beautiful. Quite the opposite. Stand and look west along the Chesil from the crown of Portland Bill at Tout Quarry sculpture park or – my favourite view of all – gaze from the top of the hill west of Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens towards Portland. It will make your heart skip a beat.And to be fair, walking any distance along the pebble and shingle bank of the Chesil will also make your heart thump like a kettle drum and your calves scream like herring gulls fighting over a dead mackerel.Does that mean the Chesil is more fun to look at than it is to walk?The way I like to enjoy the Chesil is in bite-size chunks. Otherwise it is too big (18 miles from the cliffs of Portland to the pier at West Bay), too calf-achingly crunchy, and there are too many zoned-off areas protecting the nesting sites of rare birds. It’s better to cherry-pick at the tastier, accessible parts than to try to swallow it whole. And for me, the best chunks normally involve eating or fishing, or both.Bacon and egg pie at the Jailhouse Cafe beside HM Prison The Verne is a spectacular way to start any experience of the Chesil. The best views in Dorset are now supported by inmates from the young offenders’ institution on Portland, here on work placements. Even my three gut-bucket teenage sons struggle to polish off their generous portions.Then it’s down to Billy Winters on the edge of Portland Harbour, a fist-size pebble throw from the start of the Chesil proper. This is a shack selling pulled pork in homemade ciabatta and a variety of vegetarian and seafood dishes, overlooking some of the best cockle and razor clam foraging beds in Dorset.Across the Ferrybridge, at the mouth of the Fleet lagoon, sits the Crab House Café, looking across the lagoon at the Chesil, with the sea beyond. It serves locally caught fish: mackerel, pollack, plaice, crabs, lobster and oysters from its own oyster beds. Halfway along, on the landward side of the lagoon, is Moonfleet Manor hotel, the setting for J Meade Falkner’s 1898 adventure novel of shipwrecks and smuggling, Moonfleet.The lagoon comes to an end at Abbotsbury, where the Swannery (from £10 adult, £7.50 child) offers up-close-and-personal contact with “baby swans” from mid-May to the end of June. Graffiti is not a big thing in west Dorset but recently someone spray-painted the word “cygnets” across a Swannery road sign that advertised “baby swans”.See, that’s the way we roll in Dorset. True anarchy lies just beneath the surface.From Abbotsbury to West Bexington, the Chesil is long and straight, a mound of sterile shingle blasted by the sea on one side and a haven for birds and sea plants on its land-hugging edge: plants with such gorgeous names as scarlet pimpernel, sea pea, common mouse ear and herb robert.West Bexington is a mecca for sea anglers. Just offshore is a rare strip of unbroken sand that offers opportunities for catching plaice, sole, ray and migratory mackerel which, this year so far, seem as rare as hen’s teeth. But shoals of hungry mackerel should soon be cruising along the coast, chasing silver sprays of whitebait up on to the shingle.Next stop is Cogden beach, with its convenient National Trust car park, a tasty one-mile walk west along the shingle to Hive Beach. The latter sits under the shadow of Billy Bragg’s house and the honeycomb-coloured cliffs that run all the way to West Bay, 2½ miles further west. The Hive Beach Café is crowded but deliciously dependable.My favourite places to eat at West Bay are the Watch House Cafe – slightly scruffier but lovable sister to Hive Beach cafe – with wood-fired pizzas (from £10) and fish and chips (£15) that never disappoints, and Rachel’s, a kiosk on the harbour that serves fish from the local day boats and the sort of Dorset apple cake that your waistline wishes did not exist.Serious walkers and visitors who need more than my greedy meanderings from fish plate to fish plate should call in at the Chesil Beach Visitors Centre at Ferrybridge, Portland, to experience the wisdom of the Dorset Wildlife Trust and to walk up on to the shingle where most of the shooting for the film took place.For me though, my most joyful experiences of the Chesil are when I’m in my fishing boat, running alongside it from east to west a few hundred metres out to sea, as the sun is setting, on a calm summer’s evening. This is when its anger is calmed, the gurgling shingle is peppered with the fires and barbecues of anglers and their families, and the air is scented with tangy charcoal-cooked mackerel.• The Vestry is part of a Victorian schoolhouse complex built into a hillside overlooking Chesil Beach.

Debuting on BBC radio in January 1924, Danger was set hundreds of feet below the Earth’s surface, in a pitch-black Welsh coalmine, making it ill-suited for the stage but a natural fit for audio. Broadcast out of the BBC’s London headquarters, Marconi House, it set off a wave of radio fiction – peaking with Orson Welles’ controversial broadcast The War of the Worlds and the BBC’s perennial radio soap The Archers – that wouldn’t taper off until the advent of color television.Now, radio fiction is experiencing something of a renaissance on the shoulders of the podcast boom, which has spawned more than 525,000 active shows and, according to Apple, another 50bn episode downloads. The rising tide, however, has lifted some boats more than others. Where conversation-based podcasts and true-crime narratives have thrived, with dozens of them being adapted for the screen, audio fiction has been slower to rise, hampered by the innate constraints of audio-based platforms and television’s stranglehold on episodic fiction. But that hasn’t stopped podcast producers from trying to revive the radio drama as a form of contemporary prestige entertainment.Gimlet Media, the podcasting startup based in Brooklyn, tapped the valve of radio drama in 2016 with Homecoming, the fictional thriller podcast brought to life by Catherine Keener, Oscar Isaac and David Schwimmer. Last month Gimlet released its second scripted fiction podcast, Sandra, whose titular Alexa-like virtual assistant is voiced by Kristen Wiig, with Alia Shawkat and Ethan Hawke co-starring. There’s also Tumanbay, the historical BBC period drama The Black Tapes and Limetown, two investigative shows that borrow structurally from Serial and Welcome to Night Vale, a kind of podcast turducken that presents as a radio show set in the fictional south-western town of Night Vale.Just last week, John Cameron Mitchell announced his own spin on the radio drama with Anthem: Homunculus, an anthologized musical podcast set to feature Cynthia Erivo, Glenn Close, Patti LuPone, Ben Foster and Bridget Everett. Other upcoming releases include Gossip, a 12-part soap opera by bestselling author Allison Raskin, and Battleground, originally Hulu’s first television pilot, now the first series to put the podcast-to-screen pipeline in reverse. But even while the number of podcast dramas has mushroomed, branching into experimental fiction, soap operas and musicals, its practitioners admit that audio fiction presents unique challenges.Hernan Lopez, the longtime Fox executive who in 2016 launched the podcast network Wondery with financial backing from 20th Century Fox, concurs. “I think fiction has a much higher bar to clear in audio because the number of characters that people can follow at any one time is smaller,” he tells the , estimating that listeners can keep pace with no more than six people in any one story. “If you’re an audio fiction writer, you have to be extremely disciplined, not only with how many characters you include but also how gradually you reveal them and make them distinct from one another in their personalities and their tone of voice.”That might explain why podcast networks have siphoned film and television actors, unmoored from the Sarah Koenig-esque, public radio style of narration, away from the screen and toward audio.In Homecoming, the television adaptation of which will star Julia Roberts and stream on Amazon, Keener and Schwimmer vary cadence and intonation to remarkable effect, a feat that’s even more impressive given that the show eschews narration and direct exposition of any kind. Creators Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz recorded the audio as if shooting a narrative film, moving outside when a conversation requires it and using complex sound design to cultivate the feeling of intimacy from which television programs benefit more easily. In the parlance of podcast folk, “immersive” is the word often used to characterize this desired effect. “If you look at the Wondery originals, you’ll find they have in common the immersive storytelling style, this style that makes people feel they’re in the middle of the action,” says Lopez, whose production company currently boasts two fiction projects: The Cleansed, a postapocalyptic drama, and The Dark Tome, a series of stories that proceed from a magical book found in a derelict bookshop. “It’s very different from other traditional podcasts, most of them coming from the public radio style.”Lopez believes that, even with the audio fiction boon, we’re more likely to see non-fiction podcasts being adapted as scripted television dramas, as is the case with Wondery’s biggest hit Dirty John, an investigative collaboration with the Los Angeles Times, and dozens of other podcasts like Gimlet’s StartUp and Reply All. Earlier this year, it was announced that Bravo TV optioned Dirty John for two seasons, with Connie Britton and Eric Bana starring in an anthologized, scripted take on the podcast.“It’s a natural consequence of creating stories that resonate with people,” says Lopez. “We’re going to see a lot of audio fiction projects being optioned as television shows, but I don’t believe we’re going to see many shows that were originally developed for television make their way into podcasts. When the writer realizes how fundamentally different writing for audio is to writing for television, they very quickly realize that they almost have to conceive the show all over again.”The biggest impediment faced by fictionalized podcasts isn’t their diminution at the hands of television, but the stories themselves being swept up by the screen. As Lopez explains: “Television networks are now seeing podcasts, like they did novels and comic books for many years before, as another source of ideas.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3d7aa11df1520c331d92a48283c944744539c76/0_218_3618_2171/master/3618.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c948305eed1c533c6f064579340c1e3","title":"the making of a massacre and canned laughter podcasts of the week","story":"An award-winning Propublica story gets the podcast treatment, and a TV critic attempts to ‘crack the cultural mystery’ of canned laughterThe Making of a Massacre PodcastPulitzer prize-winning journalist Ginger Thompson’s highly anticipated podcast adapted from her Propublica oral history about the mass killings in the small Mexican town of Allende lives up to the hype. She paints a picture of a place so close to Texas that residents popped over the border to do their shopping, although people lived in fear of violent drug cartels. As locals recount their stories, the story becomes increasingly terrifying: was the massacre the work of the criminals or a fallout from America’s war on drugs? HVSlate’s TV critic Willa Paskin is on a mission to “crack cultural mysteries” and, accordingly, she attempts to answer questions no one else has even thought to ask in this new monthly podcast. The first episode, The Laff Box, looks at the elusive subject of canned laughter. You might not have ever wondered why the Monkees killed canned laughter halfway through its second season, or what happens if you add it to Modern Family, but the answers are fascinating all the same. HVLast year, Amazon offshoot Audible pledged $5m in funding for emerging playwrights to produce podcasts and audiobooks for the service, a sum that – regardless of your view on Jeff Bezos – represents a considerable investment in new talent. As well as looking for the next generation of dramatists, it’s also offering the classics, such as this Radio 4-ish selection, comprising Sophocles’s Oedipus Cycle, plus three evergreen plays each from Chekhov and Ibsen. HJDKPCC’s Anne Gilbertson hosts this true crime podcast, which attempts to uncover the processes and results of police departmental oversight. From the opening, Gilbertson’s dogged approach had me hooked, and it was clear she would go to whatever lengths possible to try and answer that central question. Throughout the series, Gilbertson’s storytelling is supported by illuminating interviews and Andrew Eapen’s hauntingly beautiful score. Equal parts enlightening and exasperating, Repeat is a necessary e into the lengths to which police departments will go to protect their own. Recommended by Juniper SimonisGhosted Stories is a like a portable, wine-soaked kvetch session with your two best gal pals, namely: Co-hosts Chelsea White and Erin Leafe As assorted guests detail their stories of being “ghosted” (dropped without an explanation) by romantic partners, Chelsea and Erin offer insight and jokes. My personal favourite episode is 14, Ghosted by a Psychopath with Jen. This ghosted story is one for the record books and involves a relationship of many years, a boyfriend with multiple girlfriends in assorted cities and some major gaslighting. Recommended by Selena CoppockThe premise is basically two smart and funny guys delving into the histories of oddities they have found. The first episode, for example, starts by asking why US banknotes make no provision for blind users, allowing the pair to investigate a much deeper debate about how best to further blind rights. Delivered in a casual and funny ‘over a beer’ manner by host Bryan and Jeff it’s engaging and fun. Worth tuning in if you want to be educated and entertained in equal measure. Recommended by Pint1946Mazes are as old as humanity, with labyrinths etched into rocks 2,500 years before the birth of Christ. But according to Henry Eliot we’re living in a golden age of mazes. This week, we follow Eliot as he explores labyrinths from the myth of Daedelus to the gardens of Longleat. Charting a path from the top of Crystal Palace park to the depths of Warren Street underground station in London, we hear how modern designers have given mazes a new dimension, why they are places where you can become both lost and found, and the inspiration they have offered writers from Raymond Queneau to Jorge Luis Borges.

For example, I suspect that I won’t get to watch the ceremony even if I wanted to, because after about five seconds of turgidly reverential coverage, my three-year-old will bark “Not this one!” and force me to instead watch some godawful YouTube video where a dog sings at some fruit.But if the YouTube kids app isn’t for you and you don’t fancy the FA Cup final, there are still options. Yes, you can rule out BBC One, ITV and Sky One, because they’ve all swept everything aside in favour of covering the wedding. But that still leaves dozens of channels, all carrying on more or less as normal. And, luckily for you, I’ve cherrypicked the highlights. Here, then, is your alternative TV guide.So you don’t want to stray from the safety of the big five channels. That’s fine, because there’s still plenty for you to choose from. At 9am when it all kicks off, why not watch three episodes of Frasier in a row (Channel 4)? That’ll warm you up nicely for your big 10.30am decision: will it be three episodes of The Big Bang Theory (Channel 4), some documentaries about impressive people you’ll never hope to emulate (Astronauts: Do You have What It Takes? and SAS: Rogue Warriors, both BBC Two) or a Gadget Show repeat about aquatic drones (Channel 5). One thing’s for sure: by midday you’re bound to watch Tron: Legacy (BBC Two), because nothing protests against fawning coverage of aristocrats like a movie sequel so middling that you’d forgotten it was ever even made.This one is easy. Time it right and you can hopscotch through the day in a blissful parade of cinematic excellence. Here’s my suggested viewing order: at 8am, watch Miami Magma on the Horror Channel. Then go and have breakfast and a shower, because at 11am 5USA is showing Fatal Memories, a thriller about a woman determined to clear her sister’s name after she’s accused of murdering her mother. Realistically, you’ll barely last an hour with this, but that’s OK don’t forget that BBC Two is showing Tron Legacy at midday. Lucky you.TLC is your friend here. The whole channel is basically wedding central today. Here’s the schedule from midnight: two episodes of Curvy Brides Boutique, two episodes of Cake Boss (one of which revolves around wedding cakes), two episodes of Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta, two episodes of I Found the Gown, two episodes of Say Yes to the Dress: Big Bliss, four episodes of Say Yes to the Dress, one episode of Say Yes to the Dress: UK, two episodes of Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta, three episode of Say Yes to the Dress: UK and one episode of Say Yes to the Dress, at which point you’ll want to switch over to BBC Two and watch Tron: Legacy because you’re only human.Television has still got you covered. Lifetime’s schedule is rammed with wedding-adjacent programming like Harry \u0026amp Meghan: Royal Rebels (9:10am) and Harry \u0026amp Meghan: A Royal Romance (10:05am).At 10am The Food Network is airing the episode of Chopped Junior that featured a pre-Harry Meghan Markle as a guest judge. Look at her smiling in a way that didn’t suggest she was being slowly suffocated by duty! Remember when she used to do that?Just watch Netflix like you would anyway, or go outside. Be back for midday, though, because Tron: Legacy isn’t going to watch itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8c54810a697676875efade3949cf451b83cbb2/274_0_3224_1936/master/3224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f941326df8d85e950f7f18c8e4ddb838","title":"maersk tankers pull out of iran in blow to nuclear deal","story":"European leaders to launch statute to protect EU firms doing business in IranThe EU has put itself on a collision course with the US over Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran, as major European firms started to pull out of the country to avoid being hit by sanctions.In an attempt to shield EU companies doing business with Iran, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he would turn to a plan last used to protect businesses working in Cuba before a US trade embargo was lifted on the Latin American country.The EU is seeking to keep Iran in the 2015 accord by safeguarding the economic benefits Tehran gained in return for giving up its nuclear programme.The “blocking statute” is a 1996 regulation that prohibits EU companies and courts from complying with foreign sanctions laws and stipulates that no foreign court judgments based on these laws have any effect in the EU.The European Investment Bank will also provide a funding stream for businesses working in Iran.Juncker said: “The effects of the US sanctions will be felt. It is the duty of the EU therefore to protect European business and that applies particularly to smaller and medium-size businesses.”The European council president, Donald Tusk, added at a meeting of EU leaders: “We agreed unanimously that the EU will stay in the agreement as long as Iran remains fully committed to it. Additionally the commission was given a green light to be ready to act whenever European interests are affected.”Tusk, who accused Trump’s administration of “capricious assertiveness” earlier in the week, told reporters: “The problem is if your closest friend is unpredictable. It is not a joke now. This is the essence of our problem now with our friends on the other side of the Atlantic. I can agree with President Trump when he said unpredictability can be a very useful tool in politics. But only against enemies and opponents. Unpredictability is the last thing we need with friends and family.”Despite the tough diplomatic rhetoric, however, the chances of the Iran nuclear deal surviving the impact of US sanctions were dealt a blow when the Danish shipping group A P Moller-Maersk said it was joining an exodus of companies ceasing commercial activity in Iran.Maersk, the world’s largest oil shipping container firm, said on Thursday it would honour customer agreements entered into before 8 May, but then wind them down by 4 November, as required by the reimposed US sanctions.Iran’s oil exports were at 1m barrels a day, mostly to Asia and some European countries, before sanctions were lifted. They subsequently climbed to 2.5m barrels.Maersk operates more than 160 vessels and employs 3,100 people worldwide with a turnover of $836m in 2016.The speed at which firms operating in Iran are pulling out is threatening to wreck EU leaders’ plans to provide legal and financial guarantees to protect European firms that keep trading with Iran. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, admitted that the EU was limited in what it could do.She said: “We can see whether we can give small and medium-sized companies certain relief. That is being examined ... As for compensating all businesses in a comprehensive way for such measures by the United States of America, I think we cannot and must not create illusions.”Commenting on the Total decision, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “We’re not going to force French businesses to stay in Iran. The president of the French republic is not the CEO of Total.” The Iranian government has warned that any exodus of EU investment would force it to pull out of the nuclear deal preventing it from enriching uranium.The heart of the Iran deal – which Trump branded “horrible” as he pulled out of it earlier this month – was an Iranian commitment to end its nuclear programme in return for greater trade with the west.The danger is that the dispute over Iran will spill into a wider row between the EU and US over trade, and events will gather their own momentum as the US starts to impose sanctions on key Iranian figures.In a bid to keep the dispute from spiralling out of control, EU political ambassadors travelled to New York and Washington to urge the US to give carve-outs to EU firms from its sanctions policy. They are also warning the US administration that economic chaos imposed on Iran will be counter-productive, and is more likely to strengthen hardliners than lead to a regime change of benefit to the west.Günther Oettinger, the EU budget commissioner, urged the EU to remain united. “One thing is very clear to me: Trump despises weaklings,” he said.

But the  has established that data acquired through the Verify plugin is also being used by Storyful to actively monitor what its clients are seeing on social media. The incoming social media browsing data has been turned into an internal feed at the company that updates in real time.More than 40 Storyful employees, including journalists, editors and senior executives at the company’s offices in Dublin, London, New York and Sydney, have been granted access to the feed, providing them with a window into what other journalists are looking at on social media. has obtained a recording of the feed, which is a purpose-built channel in Slack, a commonly used office software. The channel, called #verify-notifications, displays a constantly updated list of videos and pictures being viewed on social media. Over a four-hour period, more than 200 videos and photos are shown, beside the notification: “New item viewed by client.”Two former Storyful insiders, who spoke to the  on condition of anonymity, described how the feed was considered a resource that could be mined by journalists at the company looking for newsworthy, viral or monetisable social media content that is first spotted by clients.“In my opinion it is tremendously wrong that this is going on,” one said, adding that journalists who have installed the software may have no idea their browsing activity is being monitored in this way. Storyful strongly disputed that, insisting it made “clear disclosures” about how the extension works. “The data that Verify collects appears in an internal Slack channel called #verify-notifications,” it said in a statement. “Links flow into the Slack channel with no personal data that identifies the user who is viewing the content.” The company said the purpose of the channel was to “improve the user experience in order to serve our customers better”.It said any allegation that the tool constituted a data breach or amounted to spying was “factually wrong and defamatory” and said: “We take privacy matters very seriously, we collect all data responsibly, and we are transparent in the way we use that data.”Storyful, which was acquired by News Corp in 2013, uses its own team of journalists to verify material that appears on social media, from YouTube videos of military attacks in Syria to videos of pets posted to Facebook.The Verify extension, which was launched in November 2016, was billed as a tool to streamline that process, providing what Storyful called “a one-click analysis of any piece of content on the social web”. Both the  and Reuters are understood to have previously used Storyful, which lists the BBC and Google as other clients on its website. It is not known whether journalists at any of these technology or media companies installed the Verify plugin, but the Chrome webstore suggests it has about 500 users.Once a user has installed Verify and logged into a Storyful account provided by their employer, they see a green or red signal depending on whether the content accessed on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vimeo or YouTube is on Storyful’s Newswire of content that has been cleared for use. Verify also has a button clients can use to voluntarily send content to Storyful that they would like the company to investigate content.The hunt for newsworthy social media content has spawned a competitive industry, and there is often a race among reporters to find, validate and seek permission to use videos posted to Twitter and YouTube. Viral clips can be highly valuable, and in recent years Storyful and other companies have also begun licensing social media content, charging for its use and then sharing the revenue with whoever captured the image or video. By using the Verify extension to automatically collect and monitor content other journalists are looking at on social media, Storyful can spot potentially lucrative videos and pictures that have been discovered by other reporters. One of the former Storyful employees who spoke to the  said it was considered as “a huge gain for the editorial team”, who were encouraged to monitor the channel in search of videos that could be valuable to the company. The source said they did not use the feed personally but they were given a detailed briefing on how it would be used. “It was all about the edge and seeing what people were watching across YouTube, Facebook and Twitter,” they said.The second former Storyful employee said they occasionally used the feed to search for videos or photos that might be of interest to the company, adding: “All that was explained to me is that it would make it easier for us to see what our clients were watching.” Asked if they felt they were spying on other reporters, they replied: “Yes. We were sort of spying on them to see what they were seeing. I don’t know if they knew that we were doing it.”A major problem with the feed, both of the former employees said, was that it did not distinguish between content viewed by a client for work and personal browsing content. “A lot of it was personal videos,” the second former employee said, recalling how the feed was full of people watching The Simpsons.The recording obtained by the  appears to confirm that. While it did contain photos and videos that might be of interest to media outlets, such as animal videos posted to Instagram and Facebook videos of extreme weather events, those were drowned out by what looked like a cascade of personal web browsing.The feed included YouTube clips of Charlotte Church, ITV’s This Morning, Thunderbirds and Star Wars, as well as several Instagram and Facebook photos that appeared unconnected to work. Also them were Facebook photos of the wedding of a journalist whose employer has a contract with Storyful. The images appear to have been pulled into the feed after the groom’s colleague, who installed Storyful, perused his public photo album. In a statement, Storyful said it did not have access “to posts marked as private on any platform” and said it was also “patently obvious” in a user’s browser when the Verify tool was active. “Clear disclosures relating to privacy and the functionality of the tool are given to all Newswire users that opt to install the Verify extension prior to installation,” it said.When users install the Verify extension, they are shown a link to the company’s privacy policy, which explains how it uses data but makes no mention of the plugin. When the extension is installed, users are also warned: “It can read and change all your data on the websites you visit.” repeatedly asked Storyful for any further examples of what it described as “clear disclosures” to users about the how the tool was being used to monitor the browsing activity of clients.The company pointed to a line in a 2016 blogpost introducing Verify, which stated: “Each tool we create is designed to improve our discovery and verification internally.” It also directed the  to a 2017 YouTube interview in which David Clinch, its global news editor, gave a general overview of the tool. The clip had received fewer than 90 views at the time of writing.Storyful said in its statement: “We have made very clear in our disclosures to users, in blogposts, and in interviews with the media how Verify operates, how it visibly travels with our client partners as they browse content across the social web, how we pay close attention to how our partners use the Newswire platform, how we analyse data, and also how we harness the power of our client partners and what they look for and look at in order to deliver them the news, trends and video content they need.“As with any extension, the user retains complete control to install, disable, or uninstall the tool at any time they choose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f47d4bf2cd8517a5efe9cb58f7b2f6bc4d1d162/137_163_3823_2294/master/3823.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2651f42307f1ff21dd0a2778ae8addb3","title":"ecuador to remove julian assanges extra security from london embassy","story":"President Lenin Moreno makes order after revelations of multimillion dollar spy and security operation set up for WikiLeaks founderThe president of Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, has ordered the withdrawal of additional security assigned to the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has remained for almost six years.The move was announced a day after an investigation by the  and Focus Ecuador revealed the country had bankrolled a multimillion-dollar spy operation to protect and support Assange, employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police.Over more than five years, Ecuador put at least $5m (£3.7m) into a secret intelligence budget that protected him while he had visits from Nigel Farage, members of European nationalist groups and iniduals linked to the Kremlin.Rafael Correa, the then Ecuadorian president who approved of the operation, later defended the security measures as “routine and modest”.However, his successor, Moreno, appears to differ in his view.

That was the message delivered on Thursday to six Balkan states hoping to join the EU.The six had been invited to the EU heads of state summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, as a gesture to reaffirm their path towards EU membership. Instead, the summit was notable for isions on whether or not the bloc could cope with further enlargement in the foreseeable future.The EU is keen to offer enticements to the six states, given worries about potential instability and the growing role of Russia in the region. Johannes Hahn, the commissioner for enlargement, has said on a number of occasions that the EU should “export stability” to the region to avoid “importing instability”. But many member states are uneasy about giving concrete commitments. Emmanuel Macron has emerged as the leading opponent of further EU expansion. “I think we need to look at any new enlargement with a lot of prudence and rigour,” the French president told journalists in Sofia. “The last 15 years have shown a path that has weakened Europe by thinking all the time that it should be enlarged.”A declaration was adopted at the summit that offered support for the “European perspective” of the six Balkan countries but was noticeably lacking words about “accession” or “enlargement”.Montenegro and Serbia have progressed furthest down the path to accession, with a potential joining date of 2025 mooted, though many view that as hopelessly optimistic. Next month, a decision is due to be taken on whether to open talks that could lead to accession with Albania and Macedonia. The “European perspective” for the other two nations, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, is extremely vague and unlikely to be realised in the near future.“The elephant was in the room, so we had to talk about it,” Edi Rama, the Albanian prime minister, said after emerging from a lunch with EU leaders which he described as “very argumentative” and “a fight”. Rama said he emerged with some positivity that the EU could still open accession negotiations with his country and Macedonia in June, but he also compared the EU’s vague commitments to the communist promise of a bright future that was always just around the corner. “We lived for 50 years with a red horizon which we never reached. We don’t want to live with a blue horizon now,” he said.Russia’s increasingly assertive foreign policy in the western Balkans is on the mind of European politicians and is also used by the political elites in the countries as a warning that they cannot wait for Europe for ever.“The EU is aware that it has strong competitors in the Balkans. There is no vacuum in international relations. If one pulls out or doesn’t want to act, somebody else will,” Srđan Darmanović, Montenegro’s foreign minister, told the  earlier this month.However, enlargement fatigue, plus concerns over rule of law and corruption in the Balkan states, mean that many in the EU are uneasy at the prospect of bringing in new members, especially at a time when the bloc has its own internal debates over how to deal with democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary.“With Hungary, Poland and Croatia going the way they are going, there is no appetite to import new countries with the same issues,” said a European diplomat working in one of the western Balkan nations. “But if you stop the EU integration process it’s very hard to revive it, and there is a lot to lose if you push the countries towards China and Russia.” The diplomat described the Sofia summit as “an important message to the countries that they had better get their act together”. But the EU appears to be demanding unlikely levels of reform from a group of governments whose leaders have cracked down on the media and are linked with corruption scandals.“They are willing to reform but only as long as it doesn’t touch their core interests,” said Florian Bieber, a political scientist focussing on the western Balkans.There is also the issue of Macedonia’s name, which Athens contests owing to its similarity to northern regions of Greece. The two countries’ leaders met in Sofia and said they were close to agreeing a deal on a new name for Macedonia. Then there is Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but which five EU countries do not recognise.In most of the six Balkan states, opinion polls show a strong majority in favour of EU integration and the leaders are keen to bring home solid promises from the EU to show to their citizens. Rama said he accepted that actual accession would not take place any time soon but said the path of integration was important for the hopes of young Albanians. “We need to give them a clear perspective that one day we’ll be in Europe,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35b3d50b221735e51b5981664fec86a17afee650/0_146_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c585ded4f0d3d9ba0fce12219e21e63","title":"permit scheme facilitating slavery on irish fishing boats says union","story":"International Transport Workers’ Federation takes Irish government to court after claims of exploitation of migrantsMigrants from Africa and Asia brought to Ireland to work on trawlers under an official permit scheme have a significant chance of becoming victims of trafficking, according to the seamen’s union, the International Transport Workers’ Federation. The union gave formal notice on Thursday that it would be taking the Irish government to court to stop the scheme, which it says is facilitating modern slavery.The unprecedented move follows the union referring 12 foreign fishermen on Irish boats to Irish police as suspected victims of trafficking for cheap labour in recent months. The Garda National Immigration Bureau’s anti-trafficking unit has already formally identified seven of the workers as suspected victims, and the other five are still under investigation. ITF is supporting a number of workers in test cases to try to force the government to act on persistent allegations of severe exploitation in its fishing sector. It said it was aware of dozens of other similar cases. At the end of the notice period, it will seek an injunction in the high court to impose a moratorium on the permit scheme.“We believe the permit scheme is collapsing under the weight of its own injustice,” Ken Fleming, ITF’s coordinator for the UK and Ireland, said. Special permits were introduced for fishermen from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to protect and regularise the status of large numbers of undocumented workers on Irish trawlers following a  investigation in 2015. The Irish government set up an emergency taskforce in response to the revelations. The permit scheme that was developed as a result requires trawler owners to apply for permissions on behalf of non-EEA workers they wish to bring in as crew. Previously there had been no legal route for African and Asian migrants to come for work. The government capped the number of permits available at 500, but the industry said at the time it would need at least 1,000. The permit requires employers to pay the legal minimum wage but ties migrants to their employers, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.ITF has collected testimony from dozens of Ghanaian, Egyptian and Filipino migrant fishermen which suggests that some trawler companies are paying a fraction of the legal minimum wage, and are regularly requiring migrants to work dangerously long hours, with repeated cases of industrial injury. “Migrants on trawlers here are working up to 20 hours a day and paid as though they were working eight. Rules designed to protect them go unenforced. Fishermen are afraid to leave exploitative employers for fear of arrest and deportation,” Fleming added. The union said it had been drawing attention to the exploitation for over 10 years but had been ignored by the government so was now taking it to court, explaining: “It’s an act of desperation because we have nowhere else left to go.”Some trawler owners also appear to be bypassing the new permit scheme altogether, according to the union. Very few permits have been applied for in 2018, and ITF has collected evidence that owners and recruiting agents are bringing workers in to Ireland illegally via the Northern Irish land border.The Irish government said: “This government abhors any abuse of proper employment conditions, in any circumstance.”The department of justice and equality, which is subject of the union’s action, pointed out that the permit scheme was administered by several departments. It added that it did not comment on third party correspondence. “Any changes to the scheme would be a matter for the relevant Departments with the approval of government,” it said.The problem of trafficking of workers is not confined to the Irish fleet. Arrests have been made in the UK in recent months for suspected cases of modern slavery on fishing vessels.High street retailers, who are required under the Modern Slavery Act to assess potential exposure to slavery in their supply chains, have also acknowledged the risk of trafficking for labour exploitation in the UK and Irish fishing industry. The prawn, scallop and white fish sectors are all affected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3515b9c4cc0b9c7942e83d695a7f77c218789e38/0_236_4730_2838/master/4730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657aecb249c9f0992bfabb9f317b3e8b","title":"radical kindness belgian town fostering vulnerable people tradition","story":"Residents in Geel have been taking in mentally ill strangers for hundreds of years. Now academics are looking to the small Flemish town for social care ideasMaria Lenaerts was seven years old when she came home from school one day to find a stranger at the kitchen table. It was September 1942 in Nazi-occupied Belgium. The young man looked afraid. He did not say a word to her. “He was sitting at the table like this,” she recalls, hiding her head in her arms. “He didn’t understand anything.”This was her first encounter with Jefkae Harbant, then an 18-year old with a learning disability and no place to call home. He was born in the French-speaking part of Belgium and did not speak a word of Dutch. Neither Maria nor her parents knew any French.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theDespite the language barrier, Maria’s parents, who were cattle farmers in the Flemish lowlands, had decided to take the young man in. This was not only an act of wartime charity, but came from a centuries-old tradition of stretching out a hand to people on the margins of society.For hundreds of years, residents in the Belgian town of Geel have been giving a home to strangers with severe mental health problems or learning disabilities.This is not a bed for a night or a few weeks. Many boarders stay with the same family for years, often decades. Somehow a tradition from the age of Chaucer has survived and evolved into part of Flanders’ state healthcare system. In 2018, 205 people are Geel boarders, although home care is now only for those with mental health problems, not learning disabilities.In an age that is more aware of the crushing toll of mental illness, the homecare system has made this small town near Antwerp a curiosity. One in four people will experience mental health problems in their lives, according to the well-known World Health Organisation estimate, while a majority say their pain is deepened by stigma.Geel’s model of acceptance and “radical kindness” – to cite one medical journal – has stirred interest around the world. Academics and journalists have flocked to the small Flemish town searching for inspiration from an “innovation” that is 700 years old.Geel traces its boarding tradition to the 13th century, when people with all kinds of illnesses made a pilgrimage to the local Saint Dymphna’s church. According to the brutal legend, Dymphna was an Irish saint who was murdered in the town. Pilgrims travelled many miles to her church in Geel, searching for miracle cures. When there was no more room in the church sick bay, locals gave them a place to stay.The Geel homecare tradition was incorporated into the state in the 19th century, eventually ending under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Care Centre (OPZ). Most boarders have severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or personality disorder. “They have a long history of disease and referrals. They are not capable of living alone,” says Mieke Celen, a psychiatrist at OPZ, who oversees the matchmaking process between foster families and patients.Foster families are never told the patient’s diagnosis, although they do get warning about behaviour that they might expect: can they live with someone who smokes or walks around the house during the night? Dr Celen says few relationships break down.One study of 17 foster relationships over five years, by the Belgian academics Eugeen Roosens and Lieve Van de Walle, found that only two families dropped out of the programme during the period. Geel’s medical professionals say the system makes a lot of sense. Boarders have better outcomes than patients in hospital: they take less medication and have fewer acute episodes, says Celen. Success means “having a life as normal as possible”, says Wilfried Bogaerts, an OPZ psychologist. “The programme is about life. It is not a miracle cure, it is not a magic system, but it is about finding this person the right place to live at the right time. “Very often there is a severe chronic problem that cannot be cured completely, so we try to make the best of it. We accept the limitations but then try to make the life of a boarder as good as possible.”For advocates, Geel’s forte is seeing the person, not a bundle of stigmatised labels straight from a medical textbook. Boarders are given responsibilities in the household, says Bogaerts: “They take care of the dog, go to the shop, do the dishes … so patients are needed and wanted.”For some observers, there is not enough evidence that the scheme really works. “There has been very little evaluation about the impact of this,” says Professor Sir Graham Thornicroft at King’s College London. “In terms of outcomes for iniduals, we don’t know about readmission rates, or satisfaction rates, or quality of life, or things we would normally want to assess for people with long-term needs.”Jefkae Harbant is exceptional, even by the standards of Geel family care. When the  visits, his 94th birthday is only a few days away. A cake has been ordered. Friends invited. There will be a family party.He still remembers the day he arrived on the family farm nearly 76 years ago. “He was not afraid, but it was difficult for an 18-year-old boy who came to an unknown environment,” recounts his care worker, Michelle Lambrechts, who acts as an interpreter.Maria is now 82 and has lived with Jefkae nearly all her life. When her father died in 1982, she became his foster “mother”, even though she is younger.After decades under the same roof, legal formalities have melted away. He is really a brother, she says, speaking through an interpreter, sitting in the house she has lived in all her life. There was was never a question that he would leave the family.Harbant’s foster father is Maria’s husband, Jules Teunkens, a retired glass-factory worker, now 86. Maria and Jules married in 1957. A 60th wedding anniversary mug bearing their black and white younger selves is sitting on a shelf crowded with bric-a-brac. While her husband worked at the factory, Maria Lenaerts brought up their three children and worked on the family farm. And Jefkae helped, milking the cows and tending vegetables.The family are rarely apart. Although social services offer respite care for holidays, Harbants does not like to stay at the hospital, recounts Lambrechts. “When Jefkae went to the ward, he cried a lot. He cries and he cries for hours because he doesn’t want to sit on the ward – he wants to be at home.” The number of families who take in boarders is in sharp decline, as Geel’s rural, churchgoing traditions fade into the past. More women are working. Fewer people farm the land. The traditional foster family is disappearing. Demand from patients is also falling. People with severe mental health problems no longer face the stark choice of hospital or boarding many are opting for other kinds of residential care.Geel reached its peak on the eve of the second world war, when 3,736 borders lived in the town. The numbers have been falling ever since and the decline has accelerated in the last two decades: in 2006 there were 46o borders, today 205. Younger families are proving hard to attract.The OPZ thinks the Geel model can survive, but would like the state to increase payments to families from the current maximum of €600 (£535) a month. “The openness of the community is pretty high,” Bogaerts says. “We should compensate families more so it is more attractive.”Maria Lenaerts would recommend taking in boarders, yet she doubts that the system fits with how people live now. “It won’t last,” she says. “People have a lot of activities and recreation – they don’t have time.”None of her children or grandchildren have taken in any boarders.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Assange has been holed up in Ecuador’s London embassy since 2012.Among his guests were senior staff members from RT, the Moscow TV network described by US intelligence agencies as the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet”.The visits by RT’s London bureau chief, Nikolay Bogachikhin, who is Russian, and Afshin Rattansi, a British citizen, are likely to attract attention.WikiLeaks’ publication of the emails, which painted an unfavourable picture of Clinton, is a central focus of US federal investigators conducting a criminal inquiry into possible collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin.Speculation has swirled as to how the hacked emails reached WikiLeaks and who was aware that WikiLeaks had the emails. It is unclear if WikiLeaks obtained them physically or remotely, with delivery to Assange in person only one possibility. The logs do not provide answers.Assange’s visitors also included well-known WikiLeaks supporters such as the designer Vivienne Westwood, the journalist John Pilger and the German hacker Andy Müller-Maguhn. Müller-Maguhn told the Washington Post that he once delivered a thumb drive with personal messages to Assange in 2016. He said he was never in possession of the hacked Democratic emails and never transported them. WikiLeaks published the first tranche of Democratic party emails on 22 July 2016. A declassified US intelligence assessment released in January 2017 found the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had ordered an “influence campaign” to undermine Clinton’s candidacy and boost Trump. The assessment singled out RT and referred to it as a “partner” of WikiLeaks.RT told the  that the broadcaster had been invited in June 2016 to participate in a WikiLeaks Brexit special, and that arrangements to participate in the show were made during the visits to the embassy. It said its journalists had no prior knowledge that Assange was in possession of the Clinton emails and never discussed the issue with Assange.The visitor logs were drawn up by an international firm brought in by Ecuador’s then president, Rafael Correa, to provide security for Assange. The secret programme was called Operation Hotel.Among the journalists, activists and artists who visited Assange in June and July 2016 were two Russian citizens, Bogachikhin and Yana Maximova, 28, a Russian émigré to the US who has worked as a volunteer journalist for a community radio station in Portland.Assange has a longstanding relationship with RT. He has regularly appeared in interviews with the Russian broadcaster and hosted a programme on RT in 2012.According to the logs, Bogachikhin visited the embassy twice in June 2016: once on 4 June, when he entered and left within a five-minute period, and again on 8 June, for a 22-minute visit. In an interview with the New York Times last year, Bogachikhin, the head of RT in the UK, dismissed claims that it was controlled by the Kremlin, and said the broadcaster was regulated as a “reputable news organisation” by Ofcom, the British media watchdog.Bogachikhin was described by a former colleague as a journalist who had quickly risen up the ranks at RT and wholeheartedly adopted the more aggressive pro-Russian editorial line that was established after 2008. His Twitter feed mirrors Moscow’s official view. Assange was also visited twice by Maximova, who was born in St Petersburg and moved to the US when she was 18. According to the visitor logs, she visited Assange for about two hours on 8 June and for half an hour on 9 June. The 8 June meeting coincided with a visit by Sarah Harrison, who was a close Assange adviser at the time.When she was contacted by phone, Maximova declined to discuss the meetings, and said an attorney in Washington DC would provide a written statement to the , which she described as “protocol”. The attorney’s statement never materialised and Maximova did not respond to repeated follow-up phone calls.While many of Assange’s visitors are well known in professional circles, Maximova is not. On LinkedIn, her occupation is described as “Dreamer”.She volunteered as an independent journalist with the Portland community radio broadcaster KBOO, a left-leaning station, from February to October 2014, according to another former volunteer there. Maximova, who said she was in Germany, declined to answer questions about the circumstances of her emigration to the US. Rattansi made three visits to Assange in June, including one that ended at 4.30am. The RT journalist has been a staunch defender of Assange and of Putin’s government. One of the visits, on 23 June 2016 – the day the UK voted to leave the EU – Rattansi hosted a broadcast at the Ecuadorian embassy.He returned with an RT camera crew on 2 August 2016 to interview Assange about his DNC email release. Rattansi’s broadcast was titled: “Do WikiLeaks have the email that will put Hillary Clinton in prison?”RT said: “At no point during those visits was there a discussion with either Mr Bogachikhin or Mr Rattansi about emails that related to the Clinton campaign. RT learned about those emails at the same time as everyone else – when WikiLeaks began publishing them.”Assange first declared that WikiLeaks was in possession of new Clinton material on 12 June 2016, in an interview with ITV’s Peston on Sunday. A lawsuit filed last month against WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign by the Democratic National Committee claimed Russian intelligence agents hacked into DNC servers in April 2016. WikiLeaks began publishing the material on 22 July 2016. Assange told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that the source of the material was not a state actor.Trump has denied that his presidential campaign colluded with Russians and called a criminal investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, a “witch-hunt”.Speculation about WikiLeaks’ publication of Clinton-related emails and whether anyone had advance knowledge of the leak has circulated around key Trump campaign advisers and friends of the president, including Roger Stone. Stone tweeted about WikiLeaks having further damning information about the DNC in August, before it was released in October. He has denied any involvement and said he communicated with the organisation through an intermediary.Additional reporting by Fernando Villavicencio and Cristina Solórzano."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3499431.1526583565!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"are we sending too many young people to third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlmost a quarter of students from Trinity College Dublin (above) and UCD are from fee-paying schools. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The fact that we send more students to third level than any other country in the EU is often seen as a badge of honour.The proportion of school-leavers going on to higher education ballooned from about 10 per cent in the 1960s to well over 60 per cent nowadays.Ireland now has the highest proportion of young people with third-level qualifications across the EU.But a new study released by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on the volume of of students failing to progress beyond their first year of college highlights a flipside to this achievement : are we now sending too many to higher education?Overall, some 5,800 students – or 14 per cent of all new entrants to third level – did not move on to their second year of their course.These are encouraging figures when set against higher education systems across Europe.Despite a decade of falling investment by the State in the sector – with reduced staff-to-student ratios and depleted student support services – third level colleges have managed to reduce non-progression rates overall in recent years.However, dig a little deeper and there are alarming numbers of students who have scored lower Leaving Cert points and are falling through the cracks in the system.For example, half of all students studying higher certificate courses in construction at institutes of technology failed to make it past their first year. These numbers reached as high as 80 per cent in some institutions. There is a similar pattern in engineering and computer science.This is undermining the self-confidence of young people and has a huge cost to the iniduals, their families and wider society.These figures also raises questions about the adequacy of careers guidance and challenges us to reconsider the suitability of third level for a significant minority of school leavers.Surely, many of these students would do better in other options such as apprenticeships or further education?We all learn in different ways. We are not all suited to traditional academic approaches. Apprenticeships, for example, offer excellent “earn and learn” options with on-the-job experience, decent starting salaries and high chance of employment.However, they still suffer – wrongly – from a status problem. Parents – and students – - remain obsessed with third level to the detriment of other options.There is a big job of work ahead on the part of policy-makers, guidance counsellors and the media in promoting these alternative options, boosting their standing and encouraging more students to consider them.These latest non-progression figures also highlight another stark side to the education system: how glaring inequities in society extend into academic performance.Students from disadvantaged schools are almost twice as likely to fail to make it past their first year in college compared to those from fee-paying schools.For all our talk of promoting access and equality, it is clear that students from more affluent backgrounds have a significant advantage over those from less-well-off homes.There is also evidence of a class ide across many of our universities and institutes of technology. Almost a quarter of students from Trinity College Dublin and UCD are from fee-paying schools. The comparable figures for Athlone IT, Galway-Mayo IT and IT Tralee, for example, are below 1 per cent.Geography is, of course, a factor given that most fee-paying schools are in south Dublin.However, at IT Blanchardstown and IT Tallaght, between 4 and 8 per cent of students are from fee-paying schools.Education, we know, has a unique capacity to break down cycles of disadvantage. If anything, our system seems to be replicating privilege.The Government has spoken often about its aim of building a fair and compassionate society. The rhetoric of equality, however, can flow freely off the tongue.While there are various strategies to improve the representation of working-class young people in higher education, they are modest by any measure. Much more ambition will be needed to tackle this class ide, backed up by proper funding and political will."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3499214.1526574657!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poorer students twice as likely to drop out of college in year one","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe proportion of students who did not complete their first year varied significantly across different sectors. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Students from disadvantaged schools are almost twice as likely to fail to make it past their first year in college than those from fee-paying schools, a new study finds.In all, some 5,800 students – or 14 per cent of all new entrants to third level – did not move on to their second year of their course.The research by the Higher Education Authority shows almost one-in-five students (19 per cent) from Deis or disadvantaged schools did not progress beyond first year. This compared to 10 per cent of students from fee-paying schools.These figures relate to students who began college in the 201415 academic year.Overall, a student’s Leaving Cert points are the strongest predictor of their performance in college.Students entering with lower points are much more likely to drop out or fail to complete their course compared to those with higher points.The findings are likely to reignite a debate about whether too many students who are ill-equipped to cope with the academic demands are moving on to higher education.Ireland sends more students to third level than any other country in Europe, which is seen as a badge of honour by most policymakers.However, some commentators feel more students should be encouraged to explore alternative options such as apprenticeships.The profile of student most likely to progress is a female studying education or healthcare in a university or college, with relatively high Leaving Cert points.The student most likely not to drop out is male, with relatively low Leaving Cert points, studying a level six (advance certificate) or level seven (ordinary degree) course at an institute of technology in computer science, construction or engineering.In total, the study tracked 41,441 new entrants to higher education. The non-progression rate (14 per cent) was a slight improvement on the previous year’s figure (15 per cent).The numbers who fail to make it to their second year of study vary across different fields of study. Construction and related programmes had the highest non-progression rate (23 per cent). However, this is down five percentage points from the previous years.Medicine, by contrast, had the lowest non-progression rate of all new entrants in profession-oriented courses (2 per cent) while architecture had the highest (20 per cent).The proportion of students who did not complete their first year varied significantly across different sectors.Highest rates were recorded in diploma (27 per cent) and ordinary degrees (25 per cent) in institutes of technology.This compared to lower rates in honours degree courses at institutes of technology (15 per cent), universities (10 per cent) and smaller colleges (8 per cent).Dr Graham Love, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, said overall there were positive trends.However, he said high non-progression rates on some diploma and honours degree courses in computing, engineering and construction remain a worry.“The majority of these students are male. They may learn in a different way and I am glad that the new apprenticeships model is responding to that way of learning,” he said.While rates of non-progression are generally higher in institutes of technology (IoTs) than in universities, after controlling for factors – such as academic attainment of the student and socio-economic background – some IoTs performed better than universities.Dr Love also said there needs to be adequate guidance and information at second level.“There is a personal and financial cost to the inidual student if he or she does not complete their college course there is also a cost to the State.

He asked about €2 million being spent on a plan, later shelved, to make it mandatory to have a public services card in order to get a driving licence.Mr Ross then accused Mr McGrath of blocking “every f***ing thing I do”, taken to be a reference to the Road Traffic Bill.

Almost as many (29 per cent) say they are not sure. Better-off voters are more likely to approve of the Government’s performance on Brexit, as are voters in Dublin. Urban voters in general have a better view of the Government’s performance.Other questions show similar isions. Asked if the Border is the most important issue, 45 per cent of respondents agree, but 42 per cent disagree, with 14 per cent declining to express a position.Farmers (55 per cent) and voters in the Connacht-Ulster region (49 per cent) are the most likely to prioritise the Border.Just under a third (32 per cent) of voters expect there to be a hard border, but more voters (42 per cent) say they expect Brexit to result in a soft border. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) say they do not know.Voters are almost evenly ided on the best approach to the Brexit negotiations in the coming weeks.Asked the following question: “If there is no progress on the Border issue, should the Government insist that the EU halts negotiations with the UK, or should it let negotiations continue?” In response 40 per cent of those polled favour halting the negotiations while 41 per cent say the negotiations should continue.The Government has repeatedly threatened to block progress on the withdrawal treatment if it does not see sufficient progress on dealing with the Border issues before the June summit of EU leaders.At present, the Government expects the British government to advance new proposals for some sort of customs partnership in the coming weeks. At that point the Irish Government will have to decide whether these proposals form a basis for future progress to ensure a soft border, or whether to insist that the UK comes up with a viable text for the “backstop” agreement before June.The backstop agreement, agreed by the British prime minister Theresa May last December and confirmed at the most recent summit of European leaders in March, promises to maintain the same regulations for trade and customs on both sides of the Border even if there is no agreement between the EU and the UK on ways to avoid a hard border.At the time Ms May also pledged to unionists in the North that any plan would maintain the UK’s single market. When the EU produced a draft wording that would have kept the North effectively in the EU customs union, it was rejected out of hand by Ms May, though the British government remains committed to the principle of maintaining a soft border with no new barriers or infrastructure.Yesterday in Sofia, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stuck a tough note, saying that the Withdrawal Agreement could be in jeopardy with progress on Border issues. However, the poll suggests that public opinion is ided on the Government’s approach.Previously, the Government saw a boost in its fortunes after securing the British agreement to the backstop at the December summit, so the apprehension as seen in the Ipsos MRBI opinion poll about the Government’s approach is likely to cause concern in Government Buildings. Ministers are also likely to note that while the Government has made the Border its red-line issue in the Brexit talks, public opinion is more equivocal. In addition, voters are clearly unsure about the wisdom of holding the Brexit talks hostage on the Border issue.The poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week in face-to-face interviews among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 eligible voters. Interviewing took place at 120 sampling points across all constituencies.

Photograph: Virginia MayoAP. Theresa May has set out in broad outline to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar long-awaited new British proposals on post-Brexit customs arrangements.The British prime minister is expected to put them in written form to EU negotiators within the next couple of weeks. Mr Varadkar refused to be drawn on the details of the proposals which have been the source of major disagreements in the British cabinet.However, the Taoiseach welcomed what he called the new insights into UK thinking. “Any move on customs that brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed,” he said. Mr Varadkar said he told Ms May he could not comment on the proposals until she put them in writing. After that, he said, “we can give an intelligent or measured view of it”. He put down a clear marker on the single market which suggested that Ms May’s proposals were narrowly limited to customs issues and would have some way to go to meet Irish and EU requirements. “Customs is a huge part of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” he told journalists in Sofia, Bulgaria. “While it’s a huge part of securing free trade between Britain and Ireland, it isn’t the only part of it. The single market is important as well as aspects related to regulation.” The pair met on the fringes of a European summit where Ms May also had meetings with the presidents of the European Council and Commission, Donald Tusk and Jean Claude Juncker. The former is also reported as having declined to pass judgment on Britain’s new plans insisting Ms May would have to put them in “black and white”. Mr Varadkar said that ahead of the European Council summit in June “a lot of work is still to be done if we’re going to make the ‘substantial progress’ that we need to see in June, particularly around the issues of customs and the customs element of the backstop”. Irish sources have been suggesting that a clear vision of how the UK sees the backstop being implemented needs to be on the table in June yesterday’s proposals may form part of that, once elaborated on. Asked if Ms May understood Irish concerns about regulatory alignment, the Taoiseach replied: “She does, yes. Certainly after today....” He said that the British prime minister “reaffirmed once again her absolute commitment to delivering on those commitments that were made in December, and I once again emphasised our absolute red line around our need to have those commitments reflected in the legal text. “I said to the prime minister that any move that the UK might make that would help to align all of the UK and the EU in terms of customs into the future would be beneficial, would help solve some of the problems in relation to the Border but not all of them. It would certainly help us continue to trade between Britain and Ireland much as we do now, but it wouldn’t solve all the problems.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3499060.1526568043!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"team no try to clock up wins door by door in clondalkin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNo vote campaigners canvassing  in the Westbourne area of Clondalkin, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillOn a hot Saturday morning, in the carpark of small modern church in Bawnogue in West Dublin, a group of ten people meet up. The preparation ritual is a little like togging out for a football game. The kit is taken out of the boot of a car. They all don their “ganseys” - scarlet vests emblazoned with Save the Eighth.The “pep talk” begins with a prayer led by Brian O’Flynn. He then talks the Life Institute canvassers through the development of the foetus across the weeks of pregnancy before dealing with the preferred response to any questions on rape (a woman is the victim but if aborted the baby becomes the second victim). O’Flynn also tells them to be polite, and not to get involved in prolonged debates with those on the other side. Another member of the group sprinkles them with holy water before they start moving towards Westbourne, a newish estate of neat semi-Ds about a kilometre way. Before reaching the first house they pose for a social media photograph. “Clondalkin is pro-life proud and pro-life,” they chant in unison. Is it really? Well, not numerically. Like the rest of Dublin, the No side will always be playing against the wind here. This canvass will involve hard work, some long conversations and an uncertain outcome.There has been some feedback from the No side that it is making headway in Dublin, particularly in more traditional areas with an older demographic. But in this estate, with most parents either in their 40s or younger, it is harder work.“I am more for a Yes vote,” a man tells the canvassers. He is not from Ireland and does not reveal where he’s from. “In my country there is no restriction,” he informs them.When they start talking about the unborn child, he simply says “it is sad” and shrugs his shoulders.A few doors down O’Flynn and Ruth Foley have a long exchange with David McCarthy. He is pleasant and chatty but he has already said he intends to vote Yes. “It’s important that people have a choice,” McCarthy tells them. “It’s up to them to choose for themselves. Ireland has to change and the choice has to be left to the inidual.”O’Flynn and Foley make counter-arguments in a ten minute exchange of views. McCarthy accepts the literature but he reminds them he has “definitely made my mind up”.Around the corner, a father in his 30s, is pleasant but firm. “Unfortunately I’m going the opposite way and will leave it to the woman to choose it for herself,” he says.It’s not all one-way traffic. There are a fair few straight-up Nos, including a couple originally from the Philippines.Robbie, a lone parent of a 12-year old is cleaning his house when they call. He says he has not thought about it too much and. He would be unhappy if he had a partner who had an abortion but at the same time he says he thinks it’s a decision for women. He remains in-between.At two or three doors, mothers in their 30s tell canvassers the same thing: they would not have an abortion themselves but would not prevent any other woman from having an abortion. “I want people to have a choice. Personally I will vote Yes,” one says. There is one ugly moment. A young woman relates how a friend of hers with a fatal foetal abnormality was forced to carry the foetus to term. “I think you Save the Eighth people are monsters,” she shouts at the canvassers before slamming the door rudely.But there are brighter moments for the team. A young woman, Shannon, is walking along the road with her two two young children, aged six and three.“I was No and then I was Yes,” she tells them. “I would never have an abortion myself. I have two kids.”She then asks: “If my daughter was older and if her life was at risk would they make her die?”She is told absolutely not, with the canvassers saying that the mother’s life would be saved ahead of the unborn child if it was at risk.Shannon asks for the literature and says she will read it again. “My partner and his mother are No,” she says, signalling that she may be moving back to No. A small battle won perhaps. But you still wonder, for all their team spirit, if O’Flynn and his colleagues will get the result they want in parts of Dublin like this.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3499447.1526584328!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former irish diplomat calls for backstop demand to be dropped","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer diplomat Ray Bassett has told a meeting at Westminster that the Government and the EU should drop their demand for a backstop agreement on the Border ahead of next month’s European Union summit in Brussels. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillFormer Irish diplomat Ray Bassett has told a meeting at Westminster that the Government and the EU should drop their demand for a backstop agreement on the Border ahead of next month’s European Union summit in Brussels.“I think the backstop should be dropped because the backstop can never be put into effect. It is being used as a threat. I have met nobody in Dublin who believes that the backstop will be implemented,” he said.“It’s not reality. There is no British government that could agree to that. There is complete silence from British politicians about this. I’ve heard nobody support the backstop.”Dr Bassett was speaking at the launch of his pamphlet Brexit and the Border: Where Ireland’s True Interests Lie, which is published by the Politeia think tank.The DUP’s Brexit spokesman at Westminster Sammy Wilson suggested that, if the backstop demand could not be abandoned, it should be put on ice until later in the negotiations.“I can understand from a political point of view why, having nailed their colours so firmly to the backstop mast that it is difficult for politicians to step down. And neither Leo Varadkar nor Simon Coveney are the kind of politicians who will step down easily,” he said.“I think the best we can hope for is that rather than insisting that this must go into legal language before June, it is simply left until the negotiations are completed. Because I believe that by completing the negotiations and getting a free trade agreement, many of the requirements around the backstop would disappear anyhow. That allows all the options to be explored.”Dr Bassett said Dublin was bluffing in its approach to Brexit and that the British government should make clear that Theresa May’s red lines are not negotiable.“I think the Irish Government is involved in a game of bluff. I think that they’re totally convinced that the UK is going to come in and say OK to going into the single market and the customs union. It’s all predicated on that and you have to get across to them that this is not going to occur,” he said.Asked at an EU summit in Sofia, Bulgaria about reports that London would ask to stay in the European Union’s customs area beyond the end of a post-Brexit transition period in 2020, Ms May denied she was “climbing down” on plans to leave.“No. The United Kingdom will be leaving the customs union as we’re leaving the European Union. Of course, we will be negotiating future customs arrangements with the European Union and I’ve set three objectives,” she told reporters.She said the objectives were that Britain should have its own trade policy with the rest of the world, should have frictionless trade with the EU and that there would be no hard border in Ireland.In talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk, Ms May reiterated her view that a backstop agreement put forward by Brussels to prevent a hard border was unacceptable.“The prime minister said the UK would shortly put forward its own backstop proposal in relation to customs,” her spokeswoman said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500079.1526636825!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"like an ageing rio drag queen a brexiteer mp goes through the motions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image of Isabelita dos Patins, a famous drag queen, attends  the Old Rio Fair, in downtown Rio de Janeiro.

A young woman popped up from behind a counter, silently tapped my name in, found what I was looking for and handed it to the young man.“Abstraction Raisonnée\u0026nbsp– how interesting,” he said, his eyes narrowing.\u0026nbsp“It feels so familiar and yet it’s extremely cheeky. Don’t you think?”As he described how the twist of rhubarb disrupted the calm of the vetiver, which in turn contrasted with a beguiling mix of nutmeg and tobacco, creating a paradox of austerity and licentiousness, I realised that we could talk all day, not least because there was no sign of any other customers to interrupt us.On every other block in this well-heeled corner of London, another shop is boarded up, its window advertising “an exciting retail opportunity” for anyone who wants to rent it. In a clothes shop on Sloane Square, a sales assistant listed for me all the standard enemies of retail, starting with the internet and ending with the weather.“And of course there’s the Russians,” he said, glancing over his shoulder.“They’ve disappeared. Well not exactly disappeared but they’ve gone, you just don’t see them anymore.”Many of the wealthy Russians who live around Belgravia and Chelsea have gone to ground since the latest financial sanctions from Washington made the cost of doing business with some top oligarchs insupportable. Now that we were established as confidential friends, the sales assistant leant across the counter and revealed another suspect for the decline in sales: Brexit.“To be honest, I didn’t vote. But if I had I’d have voted Out,” he said.“We didn’t understand what we were doing, they didn’t explain it. Now the City’s going to get hit and interest rates will go up. And the Europeans want to punish us for leaving, don’t they?”Spending on British high streets fell last month at its fastest annual rate in six years, down 5.4 per cent compared with April last year, and almost one in 10 shops lay empty.On the other hand, figures released this week showed that more people in Britain are in work than at any time since records began and wages are starting to outpace inflation.“Brexit Britain is booming! Remain doom-mongers talk down the UK’s economy . . . yet a record number of Britons are now in work and more foreigners have jobs than before the referendum,” trumpeted the Daily Mail. \u0026nbspA few hours after touring the ruins of high-end retail, I ran into a moderate Brexiteer Conservative MP at a party and asked him how he thought everything was going. \u0026nbsp“Everyone is just so bored,” he said, drawing out the vowel into a yawn.After an amusing display of disloyalty and a ritual warning about the folly of Ireland’s approach to the negotiations, however, he lapsed into a weary rehearsal of the promise of life outside the European Union and the wisdom of Theresa May’s approach.As I watched him go through the motions on Brexit, as so many of his colleagues on the Tory backbenches do every day, I recalled a moment last Friday night, when I found myself in a seedy nightclub in a sketchy district of Rio de Janeiro. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA fat drag queen was flanked by two skinny ones, dressed as majorettes in satin tunics and tall plumed shakos, gripping plump, crimson pompoms. The portly star and the majorette on the left were all vigour and enthusiasm as they stepped, stretched, shook and shimmied.But the figure on the right, a lugubrious senior citizen with a five o’clock shadow, could scarcely lift a leg, gazing ahead with an expression somewhere between determination and despair as she gave the pompoms an occasional, limp, desultory jerk.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500080.1526636864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prince charles to walk meghan markle down the aisle at royal wedding","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Prince Charles is to talk US actor Meghan Markle down the aisle when she marries his son, Prince Harry, on Saturday.

Markle said in a statement on Thursday she was sad he could not make it.Her mother was due to take tea with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, Harry’s grandmother, on the eve of the sumptuous wedding that will be watched by millions across the world.Outside the ancient stone walls of Windsor Castle, home to the English royal family for nearly 1,000 years, well-wishers mingled with tourists and swarms of television crews under swathes of British and American flags.Harry will marry Markle, a star of the TV drama Suits, in Windsor Castle’s 15th-century St George’s Chapel at a ceremony that begins at about noon on Saturday.The newlyweds will then be driven around Windsor in a horse-drawn carriage.Markle’s African-American mother, Doria Ragland, was due to meet the 92-year-old monarch on Friday after the yoga instructor charmed her daughter’s future father-in-law when they met on Wednesday, a source close to the royal family said.After the schism of Brexit ided the United Kingdom and triggered a wave of doubt about its future place in the world, the glittering union of one of the most popular royals and an elegant US orcee may offer some distraction.The British remain broadly supportive of the monarchy albeit with a sense of mild irony about the pomp and pageantry that accompanies it, though many have deep respect for the current monarch, Elizabeth, after her decades of dutiful service.For some black Britons, the prospect of a mixed-race royal princess has increased interest in the monarchy, which has so far been all white. A black American bishop is to give the address at the wedding.But for some other Britons, the event has as much relevance as the union of two distant super stars. Many will not even bother to watch the wedding despite massive media interest.After the hour-long ceremony, the couple will take part in a procession through the town’s ancient streets on a 19th century Ascot Landau carriage pulled by four Windsor Grey horses.Police are expecting more than 100,000 people to throng the streets outside the castle, the queen’s home west of London and the oldest and largest inhabited fortress in the world, and have said there would be tight security for the event.Harry (33), the younger son of the late Princess Diana, has always been a popular member of the royal family.A cheeky child who stuck his tongue out at photographers, he left a lasting memory in the minds of many when aged just 12, he walked solemnly behind his mother’s coffin as her funeral cortege made its way through London after her death in a car crash in 1997. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"With the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle just a couple of days away, the excitement is mounting.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend the Wedding rehearsal in Windsor.Eddie Mulholland for The Royal wedding live updates: Prince Charles to walk Meghan Markle down aisle but not give her away to Prince Harry - latest newsRoyal wedding guest list: Full details of who will be attending tomorrowPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: All the details for tomorrow\u0026#39s big dayRoyal wedding procession route: Map of Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s journey through WindsorWhat time is the royal wedding?

The beginning of the day will start off cold - around 6C (43F) or 7C (45F) - but will rapidly warm up.Temperatures will peak around 3 o\u0027clock at 21C (70F) and there will be light winds - all ideal for a wedding.The mercury is expected to have reached a summery 19C (66F) by the time the couple set off in the carriage procession.After lunch hosted by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall at the castle, the wedding party will then move on to the evening reception at nearby Frogmore House hosted by the Prince of Wales.Once again we are expecting clear skies during the evening it will be pleasant with sunshine, but temperatures will drop relatively quickly, Mr Bowles said.At 8pm it will be around 12C (54F), but once you get past midnight it will be 8C (46F) or 9C (48F) and minimum temperatures will again be around 6C.A royal fan waits behind barriers on The Long Walk leading to Windsor Castle The sun will set at 8.53pm on Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding day. A chilly night is in store on Friday for any die-hard royal watchers planning to camp out in order to bag the best spots along the route.The sun rises at 5.05am however, it will take an hour or two before things will begin hotting up ready for the day\u0027s festivities.The minimum we are likely to get will be about 6C (43F) at around 6am, Mr Bowles said. That\u0027s quite cold to be camping, but there will be low winds of maybe around 3mph and no rain is expected at all.The royal couple\u0027s ethereal tasting wedding cake will be displayed in a special installation, their baker has revealed.Claire Ptak, who is making the culinary centrepiece for the couple\u0027s big day, said the layered lemon and elderflower cake - in three parts of varying sizes - would be presented in a non-traditional way.The final design will be unveiled on the big day although Meghan and Harry are in on the plans.You\u0027ll have to wait and see on the day. It\u0027s an installation of the way that we\u0027re putting it out. It\u0027s the last thing that we\u0027ll reveal. It\u0027s a non-traditional layout, Ms Ptak said. It\u0027s a slight shift from tradition.The chef, who owns the small, trendy Violet Bakery in east London, has been working with her team of six bakers full time for five days in the large kitchens of Buckingham Palace.She described the flavour of the cake as being a balance of sweet and tart, combined with ethereal elderflower.Claire Ptak said the layered lemon and elderflower cake would be presented in a non-traditional wayThe cake, which is being decorated on the outside with a white, elderflower swiss meringue buttercream, is made of layered lemon sponge, drizzled with an elderflower syrup to a recipe specially created for the couple. The layers are sandwiched with buttercream and lemon curd.Some 200 Amalfi lemons are being used in the recipe, as well as 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial made using elderflower from the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, 20kgs of butter, 20 kgs of flour, 20kgs of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, and head baker Izaak Adams put finishing touches to the cakeMs Ptak said: It\u0027s a lemon sponge - a special sponge that I developed just for the couple, and we drizzle the layers with elderflower cordial from the Sandringham estate so it\u0027s really lovely and as local as you can get.We have a lemon curd made from Amalfi lemons which to me have the most delicious flavour.And then we\u0027ve got elderflower swiss meringue buttercream.The bunting is going up and the sun is shining (for now). Good morning and happy royal wedding eve!Excitement is building in Windsor as crowds gather ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s nuptials on Saturday.As The \u0027s Royal Correspondent Hannah Furness reports, Ms Markle has been left negotiating the last-minute dilemma of who is going to walk her down the aisle, as her mother settled in to life with the Royal family.Doria Ragland, who is now the most likely candidate to accompany the bride down the aisle, enjoyed tea with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall on Thursday, after Ms Markle’s father was confirmed as being absent from the wedding.  She will meet the Queen on Friday at Windsor Castle.Ms Ragland on Thursday spent time with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte as they took part in a full rehearsal of Saturday\u0027s service.The young page boys and bridesmaids were shown the ropes at St George\u0027s Chapel, with ten children aged between two and seven due to accompany Ms Markle.Meghan Markle Doria Ragland leaving Los Angeles on her way to LondonIn a heartfelt statement, Ms Markle asked for her father to be given “space” to recover after he contacted her to tell say he would not be able to come to the wedding, after taking medical advice.The bride-to-be was photographed with Prince Harry being driven down Windsor Castle’s Long Walk to undertake final rehearsals for their wedding at midday on Saturday.Smiling and fiddling with her engagement ring, Ms Markle appeared to be taking a difficult week in her stride as the Royal family rallied round to help.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry arrive for wedding rehearsals in Windsor on ThursdayMs Ragland, who only flew in to Heathrow on Wednesday, took tea at Clarence House with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.In what was described by sources as a “jolly” encounter, Prince Harry, Ms Markle and her mother joined the heir to the throne at home to enjoy a quiet moment in the middle of a busy day of meetings.Ms Ragland is said to have “thoroughly enjoyed” the gathering, feeling welcomed by the Prince and Duchess with whom she has much in common.The Duchess has recently taken on patronages of charities to support the elderly, Ms Ragland’s area of work, while both are known to be regular practitioners of yoga.The issue of who will walk Ms Markle down the aisle remains under discussion, with Ms Markle understood to want to delay announcing a replacement for her father too soon out of respect for him.Orders of service have already been printed, stating that the bride will be accompanied by her father. In fact, Thomas Markle is not well enough to travel, citing heart problems after it emerged he had colluded with the paparazzi for staged photographs in his home town in Mexico.In a statement issued by Kensington Palace on Thursday , Ms Markle said: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,” she said. “I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.“I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. “Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  Meghan Markle with her father ThomasBy Ms Markle’s side on the final days leading up to the wedding, her mother is helping finalise plans for the day.Already confirmed as travelling with Ms Markle to the castle for the service, she is considered the most likely candidate, reflecting their close relationship and the bride’s belief in gender equality.Ms Markle could still choose to walk alone, or be accompanied by a male friend of member of the Royal family such as the Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge, who already has duties as best man.The Duke of Edinburgh, who walked Princess Margaret down the aisle in 1960, is expected to attend after recovering well from a hip replacement operation. In Windsor, thousands of members of the public turned out to watch preparations outside the castle walls, where the armed forces carried out a dress rehearsal for their roles on the day.Video: Military in royal wedding rehearsal in WindsorSome 250 members of the armed forces are expected to take part in Saturday\u0027s festivities, lining the streets as the newlywed man and wife head on a 25-minute carriage ride through the town.There is a heavy police presence, with armed officers stationed around town and other officers on top of buildings looking over the crowds.The warm and sunny weather experienced by visitors is due to continue until Saturday when, according to forecasters, it will be 21C.

Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live updates: Prince Charles to walk Meghan Markle down aisle but not give her away to Prince Harry - latest newsRoyal wedding guest list: Full details of who will be attending tomorrowPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: All the details for tomorrow\u0026#39s big dayWhat time is the royal wedding?

May is on a tour with a promise to keep the country strong and united one year before Brexit.“This package of measures delivers on our manifesto promise to support shale and it will ensure exploration happens in the most environmentally responsible way while making it easier for companies and local communities to work together.”The motivation behind the support for fracking – or hydraulic fracturing – is to reduce the UK’s reliance on imported gas from continental Europe.In their statement, the ministers emphasised the strict regulations surrounding any new developments and their desire for an “environmentally robust onshore shale gas sector”.However, campaigners responded with anger to the announcement, citing the damage caused by fracking operations to the environment and the lack of support from local communities.Daniel Carey-Dawes, senior infrastructure campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “This announcement signals an outright assault on local communities’ ability to exercise their democratic rights in influencing fracking applications. “It reads like a wish list from the fracking companies themselves. The government may want to provide ‘sweeteners’ for communities affected, but nothing will change the fact that this will be a bitter pill to swallow.”Fracking is one of the least sustainable ways to produce electricityFracking in UK could be limited by lack of specialist waste facilitiesEnvironmental groups point to the water contamination and even potential seismic activity that can result from fracking, as well as the need to move away from fossil fuels altogether.“After seven years of fracking doing less than nothing to help our economy, the government’s still going all out for shale, and still trampling over democracy to prop up this collapsing industry,” said Rebecca Newsome, head of politics for Greenpeace UK. “Communities and their local councils across the UK have said no in every way they can, but the government have turned a deaf ear to everyone who doesn’t own a fossil fuel company.” If the proposed consultation that shale gas exploration development is treated as “permitted development” is accepted, companies would be able to drill without a planning application, environmental impact assessment or the approval of local governments.“The government’s plans pervert the planning process and could make England’s landscape a wild west for whatever cowboy wants to start drilling and digging up our countryside,” said Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Permitted development was meant to help people build a fence or a conservatory, not drill for gas.” A leaked report that emerged in February suggested the government and industry leaders had exaggerated the economic potential of future fracking operations in the UK.Fracking has previously been banned in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland due to the associated risks.Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, responded to the news by stating “fracking should be banned, not promoted”.“But the government is encouraging this dirty fossil fuel by making the planning application easier and creating a special fracking regulator.”Ms Dickinson added: “If there was a referendum on fracking, it would be banished to the dustbin of history – and that’s where these proposals belong.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitation\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – but\u0026#13Labour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.\u0026#13In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.\u0026#13Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.\u0026#13The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Spot the signs of forced prostitution:\u0026#13Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:\u0026#13Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is. He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn’t care about whether he’s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.”The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.\u0026#13Caroline Robinson, director of Flex, said: “When potential slavery victims are arrested during immigration raids then it plays into the hands of trafficking gangs, who use fear of the authorities as a way to control people. It also prevents people coming forward to report their exploitation.Without strong independent oversight of the modern slavery response, and a clear separation with immigration control policies, then many of the Prime Minister’s strong commitments to tackle modern slavery will be undermined and we will see more of society’s most vulnerable arrested instead of receiving the help they desperately need.”Efforts to combat modern slavery have spread into fields including nursing, business and public awareness campaigns to help people spot the signs of sexual and labour exploitation.More than 600 live police operations are currently underway and in 2017, over 5,000 potential victims of modern slavery were offered help under the UK’s National Referral Mechanism. Gang members who used teenager \u0027as a commodity\u0027 to deal drugs jailedA National Crime Agency report released in March revealed that British citizens had become the largest national group for the first time following a shift in the way police treat teenagers exploited to run drugs for “county lines” gangs.Other common countries of origin include Albania, Vietnam, China, Nigeria, Romania, Sudan, Eritrea, India, Poland and Pakistan, but 116 different nationalities are known to be affected.The majority of modern slaves identified are subject to forced labour, sexual exploitation or domestic servitude.Victims have been found in a range of legal and illegal trades in the UK, including nail bars, cannabis farming, prostitution, flower-picking and at hand car washes.Victoria Atkins, the minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, described the UK’s response as “world-leading”.“Kevin Hyland has played a pivotal role,” she added. “He leaves a strong legacy, and the Home Office is working with the Commissioner in his final months to see how this important role can be further strengthened. “Together we will do all we can to protect victims and bring perpetrators of modern slavery to justice.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting during the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria.People hold flags with the state coat of arms of Russia as they drive along a bridge, which was constructed to connect the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula across the Kerch Strait.Palestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFrench President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meeting during the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria.People hold flags with the state coat of arms of Russia as they drive along a bridge, which was constructed to connect the Russian mainland with the Crimean Peninsula across the Kerch Strait.Palestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Iran, for its part, has close links with the Hashd al-Shaabi and the group led by the former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki and will be wary of Mr Sadr’s Iraqi nationalism. Mr Abadi stays in power until the formation of a new government, which he may lead in an alliance with the Sadrists.Mr Sadr is perceptive about political developments in Iraq. When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen. Eternally grateful to President Trump for his courage and vision. pic.twitterpGVENzJlBtAbsorption Ministry spokeswoman Elisheva Cohen told the paper: “The ministry is working together in full cooperation with the relevant bodies in order to find an appropriate solution for the residents of the Diplomat compound and will make sure that no new immigrant will be left without a housing solution following June 20, 2020.”Meanwhile, the new embassy is inviting people to watch Monday’s opening ceremony live on its Facebook page. And Mr Friedman, visiting the site, tweeted: “Eternally grateful to President Trump for his courage and vision.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account. Our country is all the better for it.No one who values liberty would have it any other way.BRITISH politics has lost one of its good guys.The outpouring of tributes for Tessa Jowell highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.

Leaving ANY part of the EU is “Hard Brexit” now. It is laughable.Who do they imagine would tell 17.4million people their votes were to be ignored?Not Miliband, hiding in Manhattan.These Remain ultras are blind to the obvious: that the story has moved on.And that — while the nation is divided and Brexit negotiations are struggling — THEY are largely to blame, for laying siege to the referendum result itself.Their every word stokes division, helps Brussels and harms Britain.MPs must kill the second Leveson Inquiry.There is simply no case in this new, transformed media landscape — far more tightly regulated, yet dominated by UNREGULATED tech giants — for yet another public examination into alleged wrongdoing long ago.

The Kremlin, he says, is guilty of “criminal thuggery” and covers its tracks with “bare-faced” lies.This should be indisputable. But Labour is now run by the gangster state’s apologists.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Labour isn’t that voice for young black men. I’ve seen it, I’ve experienced it.He added: “Labour failed us, and London predominantly.“Yet we have a Mayor that seems to not recognise that his leadership is part of the problem in London.”Asked if he could run for City Hall himself, Mr Brooks said he was focusing on his community work but did not rule out a bid one day.The Conservative party declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They include the Windrush generation, victims of torture, refugees and victims of sexual exploitation.“Labour will take the millions that are used annually to fund Yarl’s Wood and Brook House immigration detention centres, and put this directly back into services to support the survivors of modern slavery, trafficking, and domestic violence.”Taking to Twitter, Home Secretary Sajid Javid stormed: “Labour’s new plans would demolish policies –under successive governments – that are vital for tackling ILLEGAL immigration. It’s completely the wrong approach.”The Sun last month revealed illegal immigration was so high police have arrested nearly 27,000 who have snuck across the Border into the U.K. over the past four years.The Labour announcement came a day after Mr Javid revealed up to 63 Windrush immigrants may have been wrongly deported since 2002.Ms Abbott said the Windrush scandal was a “direct consequence” of Theresa May’s policies when she led the Home Office.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not. Yet it’s all I’ve heard about on the news recently.I’m not being mean. I hope they all have a lovely day.But I couldn’t give a monkey’s if Meghan was led up the aisle by her dad, or Piers Morgan, or a flock of cackling greylag geese.In truth, Meghan and the royals aside, does anyone else?ISRAEL has over-reacted in trying to control the Palestinians rioting by the border fence.It’s handed a huge propaganda coup to the racist terrorists of Hamas. They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse. Now they run away from me.”His friend looks at his trunks and says: “I meant put the potatoes down the FRONT of your trunks, not the back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but others describing it as a missed opportunity for mum Doria.BBC royal commentator Dickie Arbiter said: Personally I would have liked to have seen her mum do the honours, but that might have been a walk too far.He added: Its an honour for Prince Charles and hell be tickled pink but maybe for mum it would have been a walk too far.Fellow commentator Victoria Arbiter wrote: No doubt it will be a proud and beautiful moment for Charles walking Meghan down the aisle but I feel an even bigger moment has been missed with Doria.She later told 9Honey: Prince Charles has long talked about the fact that he would have loved a daughter, so this gives him an opportunity to walk a beautiful young lady down the aisle to his waiting son.Its going to be a deeply personal moment for the father and son, not to mention Meghan.I also think its a lovely way of showing that the Royal Family is behind this marriage.Meghan has really faced an amazing amount of vitriol and abuse from certain areas - people saying that shes not worthy of the Royal Family, or that she shouldnt be marrying into the Royal Family.Its good news for Meghan and Harry, who have endured a turbulent week in the lead up to the big day.Meghan had yesterday released an emotionally-charged statement to confirm her 73-year-old dad Thomas Markle, who lives in Mexico, would not be able to attend her big day.In the statement, the bride-to-be said: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding.I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.It was an astonishing statement that seemed to be directed towards her family, who have been outspoken in their criticism of the US actress - claiming she has not properly cared for her dad.Meghans estranged family members - including her nephews and sister-in-law - also landed in the UK despite not being invited to the wedding - have regularly trashed the 36-year-old bride.The Royal Wedding plans had been thrown into chaos when 73-year-old Thomas Sr announced he wouldnt be attending - after being left embarrassed over staged paparazzi photos.While Meghan reportedly begged her father to attend - saying she still loved him - her reclusive dad eventually pulled out.This means that mum Doria, who will today meet the Queen over afternoon tea, will be the only direct relative of Meghans at the wedding.Pals flew into the UK to support Meghan, with best friend Jessica Mulroney arriving this week.The Canadian socialites children are among who will be bridesmaids and page boys during the ceremony.But despite the drama, Prince Harry and Meghan are now gearing up for the ceremony, with family including Kate Middleton - who was yesterday seen for the first time since the birth of Prince Louis - having headed to Windsor for wedding rehearsals yesterday.Meghan has endured constant criticism from her family who claim she has not supported her dad - including from outspoken half-sister Samantha Markle.Samantha lashed out overnight, saying she had even been forced to wire Thomas Sr cash to survive.Thomas Sr has previously blamed his health woes on his son Thomas Markle Jr over an open letter he wrote to Prince Harry - branding the wedding as a fake fairy tale."},{"url":null,"title":"lad slammed after setting up gofundme page to raise 1k to pay for his holiday","story":"Aiden Dugdale, from Burnley, posted on social media that he was sick of people on benefits being able to go abroad and I cant, so can people help?.He added: Why can people on benefits go on all inclusive 5 star hotel holidays abroad and I can barely afford a night out in Burnley?A friend then criticised him for his comments about people on benefits - so he posted: UPDATE: I have created a GoFundMe page so people can help pay for a holiday.The 19-year-old listed his fundraiser on GoFundMe in the emergencies category on the crowdfunding site.But while he says it is just a bit of fun, some friends havent seen it that way.One wrote: Nice try you tool!Another said: You scrounger, save up like other people and if a holiday is that important to you fund it yourself.But is has not all been in vain - as he has raised £10 so far.One supporter who donated £5 wrote: Proper made me smile this, good on ya.

I am happy with the way they are. I am the governor, no matter what.”His factory worker wife Marilyn, 64, joked: “He won’t do anything I say. He does what he wants.”But she admitted that she would “probably” pay for a dentist to improve her own discoloured teeth.The couple who have four sons and five grandchildren said they wanted to spend their win on decorating their home in Stowmarket, Suffolk.They are also splashing out on a trip Jamaica - which will be their first holiday in ten years - and a new sofa and giant TV, so Matt can watch the World Cup in comfort.Self-employed Matt insisted he would not quit his seven-days-a-week job because he liked being busy and would not let customers down.He also has no plans to replace his 22-year-old Vauxhall Corsa van, which he bought five years ago for £470.Matt said: “I have always been around old vehicles for work. I am used to old vans, and that is me.“At the moment we have commitments for people and we need to settle down and take it from there.“We are going to carry on and keep being normal people. It’s not going to be normal, but you want to keep yourself pretty straight and narrow.”Matt confessed that he had gone into work this week despite the win because he had promised a plastering job for someone moving home.He joked that he would now be limiting himself to working “just six and a half days a week”.Matt also insisted that he and his wife of 33 years did not want to move from their three-bedroom semi-detached house. He said: “We are happy where we are living.”But he added: “Like everybody, we have had good times and bad times, but now it could get a little bit better.”Tennis fan Marilyn who has never been to Wimbledon said she may buy herself a ticket for the mens’ final this year, as well as a new car to replace her 14-year-old Toyota Celica.She also plans to cut back her hours at her part-time job packing greeting cards at a family run factory in Stowmarket.Marilyn said she did not want to retire completely because she enjoyed working with her colleagues so much.Her jackpot winning Monopoly Classic scratchcard was one of two she bought for £5 each from the Esso petrol station last Sunday, at Combs Ford, near Stowmarket.She paid for the cards with a £10 win on another card, while on her way to pick up her son, who was travelling back to Stowmarket from Ipswich by bus.As she waited for him in her car at the town’s station, she scratched one card which won £20 and then did the other one which turned out to be worth £1million.She said: “I felt physically sick. I just didn’t believe it. I kept looking at the card until my son arrived, and I said: ‘Look at this.’ He just said, ‘Oh my God’.”Marilyn stopped at the same garage on her way home and had the win confirmed.Matt was on his mobile phone when arrived home from work and his son yelled: “Mum’s won a million.”The plasterer calmly told the caller: “I’m very sorry, I have to go. My wife has just become a millionaire.”Marilyn added: “We’ve no intention of moving house, but it will so nice to spend some money on renovations I’ve been wanting to do for years.“My front room will have a total overhaul with new furniture, including a whopping big telly so Matt can watch the World Cup in luxury.“Initially I was thinking I could watch Wimbledon on that massive TV too, but now I’m thinking I could actually go to Wimbledon. I rather fancy centre court for the men’s finals.“We want our boys to benefit from the win too, so well be giving them each a bit to help make life easier.We’ve all had tough times over the years, so it’s nice to know we have some fun times ahead.“It really is magic.

You could perhaps have Max Fac in 2085, but it’s not readily available now or even in three to five years. It would be the miracle solution.”The official said the UK and EU could agree to either change the end date for the transition, currently set for December 2020, or to roll it over until an answer is found.They said: “There’s no legal limit, so in truth it will be a political decision in the end. It would be a bit more complicated if it’s really indefinite in time.”And they insisted EU leaders will not let the UK crash out without a deal given the risks that would pose to their economies.They revealed: “Leaders won’t want to take any additional risk that would dampen growth even more.

on high alert after the UK was rocked by a series of terror attacks in the year, including members of the public targeted in sick attacks on London Bridge, Westminster Bridge and Manchester Arena.The wedding will be one of the most heavily guarded events in history, with police snipers perched on roof-tops, special-forces troops mingling with crowds and road blocks in place.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town - which has a population of 35,000 - to see Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle on Saturday.And security specialists will be ready for anything - planned for any possible disruption from protesters to a full-on terrorist attack.The huge bill, estimated by wedding planning service Bridebook, is said to cover the cost of a ring of steel perimeter around the castle grounds as well as regular patrols of armed police and sniffer dogs.Officers have also started using an automatic license plate recognition system to flag any known suspicious vehicles.Inspector Andy Amor, who has been coordinating the patrols, said: Our officers have been out and about in the town, on patrol, talking to members of the public and engaging with them.These patrols are very much business as usual for us, however, they are all part of our security measures to ensure that everyone coming to Windsor for the royal wedding on Saturday has a safe and happy day.Thames Valley Police is experienced at policing large scale events such as these and we want all residents, businesses and visitors to the town to know that we are here, and to approach us if they have any questions at all.He added: I’m really pleased and proud to be involved in policing this event.Windsor is a fantastic town in which to live and work, and our officers are very much looking forward to Saturday and focused on making sure that the event is secure and enjoyable for everyone involved.Other experts have also weighed in over the huge police operation, with security expert Will Geddes telling the Daily Star that operations would have been planned for months.He said that cops would be looking for a variety of threats, saying: Police will have mapped the area, established risk profiles, and worked out the modus operandi of high-risk groups.He added: The world will be watching — nothing can afford to go wrong.While a heavy presence on the streets will help to act as a deterrent, covert operations are expected to include plainclothes police, special forces, the SAS, and the military.A no-fly zone will also be in force during the service.The Royal Family already descended on Windsor yesterday for a rehearsal of Saturdays ceremony, with bride-to-be Meghan Markle appearing calm as she sat next to her future husband.The US actress could be seen smiling next to Prince Harry, despite having just hours earlier revealed that her dad Thomas Markle was not able to attend their big day.Instead, Thomas Sr will continue to recover in hospital after undergoing heart surgery just days before the Royal Wedding.He had earlier thrown wedding plans into chaos after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs -

Its May so theyre just opening this week.The website says the following recipe serves 12, takes 20 minutes to prep and 45-50 minutes of baking time.Reproduced with permission from Belvoir Fruit Farms.Its a kind of an ethereal, floral flavour which I think is very special, especially for a wedding.Slices of the cake will be served to the 600 guests at the lunchtime reception in St Georges Hall after the ceremony.Three types of Meghans favourite flowers peonies - Madame Claude, Bowl of Cream, and the aptly titled Duchess - in shades of white and cream will decorate the cakes, along with four different white and cream roses - Patience, Purity, Jeanne Moreau and Princess Miyuki.The flowers will be removed before guests tuck in to the cake, but the slices will be served with edible rose petals.The team from Violet Bakery, who were dressed in matching white polo necks, khaki trousers and cream aprons, have been working busily in the well quipped palace kitchen.Claire, who was on Thursday removing one of the circular cakes from its large tin, before beginning to ice it with buttercream, was helped by Violet Bakerys head baker Izaak Adams.She added of how the baking was going: Theres a few logistics of serving so many people at the same time. But its been a great process.She said Harry and Meghan loved the lemon and elderflower cake after trying a number of different samples.They loved it. They tried quite a collection. What they said to me is that they really loved the idea of the seasonality and the freshness.Claire is not making a back up cake in case of a disaster, saying: Its cake. It cant go that wrong.We have enough cake and we dont want to be wasteful. Anything that is left over, we were going to donate to charity.The chef had to call in some of her former workers to have enough staff to work on the cake and keep her bakery open.Part of the cake is still being baked and iced.It will be transported to Windsor Castle where the flowers will be added, and the installation assembled on the morning of the wedding."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406135572.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"locking britain into some customs pact is not brexit its the road to ruin","story":"We are told it would be “time-limited”.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We haven’t been able to get any detail on that yet but certainly any move on customs that brings the UK closer to the EU is to be welcomed. “But I very much emphasised that resolving the issue of avoiding a hard border requires more than just customs. It would help solve some of the problems related to the border but not all of them.”The prospect of remaining aligned with Europe alarmed Brexiteers.Jacob Rees-Mogg said that if Mrs May agreed to what Mr Varadkar appeared to be proposing, it would be “a failure” of her policy of making Brexit mean Brexit.“She would have to eat a very large quantity of her own words. I have trust in the Prime Minister and I believe that this will not happen,” he said. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004008816474.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle royal wedding prince harry princess diana harry","story":"Thomas Markle Jnr now insists the bride-to-be shares empathy and love for the common man.He told Mirror reporters outside Buckingham Palace: Perhaps Harry sees a lot of his mum in Meg, how she is with people.From the moment she could put her arms around someone, she always wanted to cuddle to them.She was an incredibly affectionate child who developed a tremendous sense of empathy and understanding for people.

And that is why today\u0027s announcement has sparked such outrage.On the one side there are those who think that controlling the scope of betting machines amounts to proof of a nanny state.The Government is meddling, they say, and it will cost jobs and destroy fun. If people want to waste their money on betting machines with a paltry chance at making a profit, so the argument goes, who are we to stop them.On the other side are those who point at the victims of gambling addiction, and who believe that the state\u0027s role is, basically, to stop people doing things that are bad for them, their families and, you might say, for society at large.Now it is hard to say that fixed-odds betting terminals do any social good. Yes, they raise money for the Treasury, and help bolster the profits of some - but not all - betting companies.It may be that some people find them fun, just as some people think fox hunting is fun, but social good? Hardly.The flip side is that it is hard to argue that they don\u0027t do harm - there are many stories of players frantically spending the family savings, of desperate addiction, and of the hapless inadequacy of the existing laws to stop repeat losers.One gambler lost \u0026#16314,000 in seven hours others have been convicted after smashing up shops in desperate fury.The industry will have us believe that these people will all drift to alternative locations - amusement arcades, casinos and shadowy back-street suppliers. The problem, they say, will just be moved elsewhere. What\u0027s more, so we are told, the collapse of these machines will also result in hundreds of shops closing, thousands of job losses, and a huge hit to the Exchequer.And yet sometimes Governments are there to make these sort of judgements.Presumably, somewhere, there are people who were laid off when the local land-mine factory closed.At the end of the First World War, workers were laid off from the factory in Avonmouth where Britain had been making mustard gas. It\u0027s not good enough, frankly, to defend something purely on the grounds that an industry supports jobs.As for the Treasury - that\u0027s a matter for the Government. But within the context of the nation\u0027s tax take, it\u0027s not a big loss, particularly when set off against the plans to impose a different levy on the betting industry.Our giant betting companies are all profitable enterprises, whose future is not dependent upon these machines.

Between 400 to 450 soldiers could be sent to the country which would bring the total UK deployment to more than 1,000. The US has increased its presence in Afghanistan since Mr Trump unveiled his South Asia strategy in August last year. Around 4,000 troops are thought to have been added to the 8,400-strong US deployment in the country, to bolster the Kabul government, train Afghan forces and fight the Taliban and other militant groups. And now Mr Trump is expecting the other NATO members to do their share after strongly criticising those allies like Germany who don\u0027t spend the required 2% on defence. He will ramp up the pressure ahead of the NATO summit in July with the ultimate threat that the US, which is the biggest contributor, could withdraw from the alliance which would in effect kill it off.   Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is understood to have written to the Prime Minister recommending the increase, although a decision is yet to be made.  The Ministry of Defence said the UK\u0027s contribution to the mission was kept under constant review. But former general Sir Richard Barrons warned that even more troops could be required. The majority of troops currently there are in a training capacity but Sir Richard warned they should be prepared to accompany Afghan forces on operations.  The retired officer said the decision to end combat operations in Afghanistan at the end of 2014 hasn\u0027t worked. He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today that 400 extra troops would send an important message to our allies that they should do more and would also signal to the Taliban they will never bring this fight in Afghanistan to an end by fighting, they have to resort to dialogue. But he suggested a greater military presence and an enhanced - and more dangerous - role should be considered, with troops leaving the relative safety of their bases to accompany Afghan forces on operations. I absolutely think, if we are going to make a meaningful contribution, we will have to find the courage to train, advise, assist and accompany them into action, Gen Barrons said.  With that comes some risks and consequences, but that\u0027s how you make a difference. Gen Barrons suggested that the UK should deploy around 10% of the troops sent by the US, which would lift the British contribution to more than 1,200. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: The support the UK provides Afghanistan on security, development and governance is crucial to building a stable state and reducing the terrorist threat to the UK. We remain committed to Nato\u0027s non-combat Resolute Support mission, in which we play an important role, and keep our contribution under constant review.

The heir to the throne stepped up to the plate two years ago to give away a best friend\u0027s daughter when her own dad was reportedly too ill. The society wedding was between Alexandra Knatchbull, 35, the great-granddaughter of Lord Mountbatten, and Thomas Hooper. The Queen and Prince Philip were also in attendance. There was speculation at the time Charles had given Alexandra away because of her own father Lord Bradbourne\u0027s ill health.  Alexandra wore classic white gown with an elaborate laced veil as she was walked down the aisle by Charles in a grey morning suit. Charles was best man at Lord Bradbourne\u0027s own wedding, 70, and he went on to become Prince William\u0027s godfather. The wedding at Romsey Abbey in Hampshire in June 2016 was attended by aristocrats from across Europe.  Queen Sophia of Spain, the former King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan were present. Meghan, 36, was left with a gaping hole in her Windsor Castle wedding plans after her own dad Thomas, 73, pulled out with just days\u0027 notice. It followed heart surgery and a row over posed paparazzi photographs. A statement from Kensington Palace read: Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her wedding day.    The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to the royal family in this way. Yesterday morning, the palace released a statement from the former actress revealing her dad would would not be attending. The statement read: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.

Now experts have worked out Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big day could come with a hefty price tag - a cool \u0026pound32million. The average person spends \u0026pound17,913 on their day, but the royal couple\u0027s comes with a lot of extras - from bespoke silver plated fanfare trumpets to a drone destroyer. Wedding planning company Bridebook has calculated the cost based on flowers, food, entertainment and the main attraction, the dress coming in at \u0026pound1,969,873, but there\u0027s also the \u0026pound120,000 honeymoon and \u0026pound30m security costs. It\u0027s unsurprising then that the wedding, which is being held at Windsor Castle on May 19 , is expected to make the list of one of the top ten expensive weddings of all time. The main cost is down to security, as Windsor will be locked down for the day, bumping up that security bill, including snipers, undercover police and a counter-drone system - it\u0027s estimated to all cost \u0026pound30million. The bill is expected to come in higher than brother Prince William\u0027s wedding, which cost \u0026pound20m - though it was a larger affair - because of the ongoing terrorist threat level. Venue - Free  The ceremony is taking place at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle while the reception will be in St George\u0027s Great Hall, within the castle.  Marquee - \u0026pound350,000 Later the party moves to the Upper Ward grounds of Windsor. While the pair don\u0027t have to pay for the venue, they will have to fork out for that marquee.  A luxury glass marquee, similar to Pippa\u0027s cost \u0026pound300,00- plus additional catering and staff.  Catering - \u0026pound286,000 There\u0027s the formal lunch reception for state guests and the dinner reception for their family and friends. This will end up being one of the more costly parts of the wedding. Sausage rolls and hot tea for the members of the public won\u0027t come cheap either, with 2,640 of them it could come in at \u0026pound26,000! Cake - \u0026pound50,000  Harry and Meghan are opting for a banana wedding cake (we know) as well as a second cake. The unique cake will be made by pastry chef Claire Ptak , - owner of London hipster hotspot Violet Bakery. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. Drinks - \u0026pound193,000 It\u0027s not a party, without a tipple or two! The drinks will most likely come from the Palace Cellars, but they\u0027re still worth a fair bit. If we\u0027re looking at the number of guests, they\u0027ll probably need 2,300 bottles to keep guests happy. Bridebook works out roughly 1,700 bottles of champers will be served throughout the day and 650 bottles of wine, whiskey and cocktails. A bottle of Bollinger, the family\u0027s favourite champagne, comes in at \u0026pound80 a bottle - that\u0027s \u0026pound136,000 overall. Prince Charles enjoys the 15-year-old Laphroaig Scotch and the multitude of bottles of Tignanello Wine (Meghan’s personal favourite according to her old lifestyle blog, “The Tig”) so the bill really adds up. Prince Harry\u0027s fav drink comes in a little cheaper - it\u0027s a Vodka Redbull. Dress - \u0026pound300,000 Meghan is expected to rack up quite the bill with her wedding dress , which is fair enough considering all eyes will be on her. Most of the budget will go on her first dress, which will be made just for her. There\u0027s a lot of rumours as to who will design it and what it will look like, but you can expect a clean, classic look with a modern twist. A dress like this, plus her second outfit for afterwards will come in at \u0026pound300,000 plus. She\u0027s teaming it up with a tiara .  Other sources have predicted that Meghan\u0027s dress will cost far less. Royal expert Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss and Love, told The : “Meghan is very mindful of wanting to send the right message with her gown. “It’s going to be iconic and fit the backdrop of Windsor Castle, but it would send off the wrong message to wear a dress that in cost alone would upstage Kate’s.” Kate\u0027s dress, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, came in at \u0026pound250,000. Flowers - \u0026pound110,000  This often costs more than you expect, and with two locations it\u0027ll cost even more. Flowers for the marquee alone cost cost approximately \u0026pound70,000. The flowers in St George\u0027s Chapel and at the formal reception which follows will be provided by self-taught florist Philippa Craddock. Photos - \u0026pound17,000 Cheap hey? Dorset-based Millie Pilkington, the private wedding photographer for the William and Kate’s wedding and Pippa Middleton’s, is expected to take the pics, though Hugo Burnand should also be around for the official snaps. Stationary - \u0026pound20,000  Kensington Palace has announced Barnard and Westwood made the beautiful bespoke invitations for the Royal Wedding. A 200 piece Bespoke Stationery set from Barnard and Westwood exceeds the \u0026pound10,000 mark. The invites, with the Three-Feathered Badge of the Prince of Wales printed in gold ink, could cost a total of \u0026pound200,000 for the circa 4000 invitees, including members of the public, or \u0026pound50,000 for the VIP guests alone. Music - \u0026pound300,000  That\u0027s the bell ringers, organist, choirs....then the music for the reception too. Rumours are flying around as to who will perform - from the Spice Girls to Elton John in the running, Coldplay\u0027s Chris Martin or Meghan\u0027s mate Rihanna...but there\u0027s still the church music to pay for. Trumpets - \u0026pound90,000 Yes, trumpets. The Ministry of Defence has made a request for 20 silver-plated fanfare trumpets stamped with the Royal Coat of Arms. Made in the same workshop where Will \u0026amp Kate’s wedding and the London Olympics’ trumpets came from, each bespoke trumpet costs between \u0026pound3,000 and \u0026pound6,000. Decorations - \u0026pound130,000 The lighting for the church, marquee and furniture all rack up the cost.  Wedding rings - \u0026pound6,000 Since 1923, it has been a tradition in the Royal Family to use Welsh gold for the wedding ring of the bride. Royal warrant holder Wartski, with ties to Wales, created Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge’s ring, so could be the same choice of Meghan’s.  Prince Phillip and Prince William chose not to wear a ring, but it\u0027s thought Harry will opt to follow in his father\u0027s footsteps and wear a band. Charles\u0027 is on a ring on his little finger on his left hand, but Harry may opt for the traditional fourth finger.  While Meghan isn\u0027t opting for adult bridesmaids she is having the kids as flower girls and the boys as page boys. A page boy outfit will cost around \u0026pound226 each, and flower girl dresses \u0026pound340. Groomswear – \u0026pound8,000 As a qualified Apache Helicopter Commander, Prince Harry is likely to be wearing a tailor-made Royal Air Force uniform to his wedding. He\u0027ll need to change later too, so a tuxedo or suit also needs to be bought. Hair and Makeup – \u0026pound10,000  Belgravia’s Neville Hair \u0026amp Beauty is a favourite of Meghan’s, or she may opt for Hannah Martin of Bobbi Brown and Richard Ward, who did Kate and Pippa’s wedding makeup and hair. Church Fees – \u0026pound175 The couple have to pay their fees just like everyone else.  Security - \u0026pound30m This is the most expensive elements of the day. A hefty \u0026pound30m was spent on Kate and Wills\u0027 big day so expect more of the same. While the wedding isn\u0027t in central London, there\u0027s still a huge number of members of the public attending. With the threats made against the couple ahead of the service, security is sure to be tight - with drones, snipers and undercover cops. There\u0027s a British counter-UAV system, costing \u0026pound1m, used to deactivate intruders and sneaky drones - including pap ones! Entertainment – \u0026pound55,000 This is mostly a guest. Expect the Royal Air Force to be in there somewhere, maybe some fireworks, entertainment for all those children... it all adds up The Honeymoon \u0026pound120,000  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly heading to the exotic country of Namibia for their honeymoon . Sources have also revealed that Meghan will be the one paying for the honeymoon as gift to the Prince and that the cost will be upwards of \u0026pound100,000.

Bronte Howard says her massive debt is already more than the mortgage her grandparents took out on their three-bedroom home in the 1970s.  And the amount will continue to rise each year due to interest.  The Wales Online reporter discovered she owes \u0026pound53,409.20 after checking her student loan statement for the first time this week.  She says MoneySavingExpert Martin Lewis told her to rip up the statement, saying it\u0027s totally irrelevant and shouldn\u0027t be sent.  But she questions whether it is as simple as that. Below, Bronte writes of her shock and the advice she has been given.   Her words first appeared on Wales Online .   I’m 22 years old and I already have a massive debt hanging over me. It’s more than the mortgage my grandparents took out when they bought their three-bed house back in the 70s. I’m not a frivolous shopper, I don’t have gambling debts and it isn’t from buying property. It’s the price I - and millions of others - have paid to continue studying since tuition fees were first introduced in 1998. For those of you who were lucky enough to be able to borrow from Student Finance Wales (which I believe has a slightly better system where the Welsh Government contributes towards tuition fees, meaning students only pay \u0026pound3,000 a year) or were able to pay the fees without needing to take out loans, I’ll briefly explain how the English system worked when I took out my loans in 2013 and 2016.  I paid \u0026pound9,000 a year to study a bachelor\u0027s degree in English Language and Linguistics at the University of Sheffield. This cost me \u0026pound27,000, which I borrowed. I was also given money in the form of loans (which I have to pay back), grants and bursaries to cover things like rent, food and books. I think in total I had around \u0026pound8,000 a year to spend. Some students studying now are even worse off after the Government scrapped grants and introduced a second loan for students whose parents are on a low income. But after added interest, which started being added to the already hefty bill in April 2017, I currently owe \u0026pound42,711.43 for my undergraduate degree - a lot more than my Welsh friends. I then decided to do a master’s degree in journalism at Cardiff University so I took out a \u0026pound10,000 from Student Finance England and it barely covered my tuition fees. So I actually ended up with overdraft debt and had to rely on my parents (thanks mum and dad) and savings.  At the time, Student Finance Wales didn’t offer a postgraduate loan, so in a way, I was better off than some of my coursemates. (Although now Welsh postgraduate students are entitled to borrow up to \u0026pound13,000). I start to pay this back when I earn \u0026pound25,000 and what I pay is based on how much I earn, not how much I borrowed. But after four years of university, I now have a debt that, unless I win the lottery, I doubt I will ever fully pay back. I didn’t really think about how much I owed and I didn’t know the exact figure until a few days ago when I checked my statement online. I’d almost forgotten that I owed money because it’s almost an invisible debt. I thought it would be somewhere in the region of \u0026pound40,000 because naively, I didn’t really understand interest rates when I took out the loan at 18. It’s actually \u0026pound53,409.20 and will continue to go up each year when interest is added.   The interest rate for my postgraduate loan has also been increased to 6.1%, which is higher than the interest rate for a lot of mortgages and is probably going to go up again. So, after seeing the huge figure I asked finance expert and MoneySavingExpert\u0027s Martin what I should do. After all, it’s a huge amount of money but it doesn’t seem like anybody really cares. He said: \u0027Rip up your statement - it’s totally irrelevant - and shouldn’t be sent. Just consider that you’ll pay 9% extra tax if you earn above \u0026pound25,000. Why on earth would you try and pay it off?” When I eventually start paying the debt, I’ll pay 9% of whatever I earn above \u0026pound25,000 until the bill is paid, or wiped clean.

Thomas Markle Jnr, 51, told how from an early age, the bride-to-be showed she “genuinely cares about people” and puts them first. Standing outside Buckingham Palace yesterday, he said: “Perhaps Harry sees a lot of his mum in Meg, how she is with people. “From the moment she could put her arms around someone, she always wanted to cuddle to them. She was an incredibly affectionate child who developed a tremendous sense of empathy and understanding for people. People wrongly think because she is an actress, it is fake.  I understand why they would. “You see this huge Hollywood smile with her big eyes, but, behind it all, she genuinely cares about people.” He added: “When I read she’d secretly visited the Grenfell Tower victims it came as no surprise to me. She’ll still be going, knowing her as I do.” The dad of two gave a unique insight into actress Meghan, 36, which he says the world will see after she marries Harry tomorrow. He told how the Suits star helped him nurse their gran Doris, with the aid of their dad Thomas Markle Snr, 73, after Doris was diagnosed with dementia in 2009.  Thomas Jnr said: “What people will learn is how unselfishly she puts others first. When our grandmother was ill, she was placed into a home. “Dad had grown increasingly worried after she was found putting things on the stove or wandering the streets, confused. For two years, every other weekend Meghan visited Gran without fail. She would read to her, show her books, watch TV with her. She did anything to make life appear normal as possible. “As she grew worse, Gran would often forget who my dad or I was. We were going every weekend. But when Meg walked in, an instant smile crossed Gran’s face and she knew she’d be OK.” He went on: “Meg has this ability to bring comfort to those she meets, and I truly think it’s something similar to what Princess Diana had.  She has a great warmth for people she meets, installed in her by [her mum] Doria and Dad.” Thomas Jnr yesterday toured Kensington Palace to see where his half-sister will spend her new life with Harry, 33. Recalling Meghan’s upbringing, he said their dad “doted” on her. The glazier went on: “She was his entire world. “Dad worked very long days as a lighting director in Hollywood. He was extremely well respected in his field and got paid well for what he did. It allowed him to provide everything Meg could wish for she wanted for nothing. “But despite the lifestyle she had, it was Dad’s affection she was richest in. There’s a picture of Meg as a baby lying on his chest. It’s the perfect picture of the two. They were inseparable.”  Thomas Jnr, who hopes to rebuild his relationship with Meghan after growing apart in recent years, was 15 when she was born. Several years earlier, his dad had met make-up artist Doria Ragland at a TV studio and they fell in love. Despite a 12-year age gap, the pair got married. They lived in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles when Meghan was born. Thomas Jnr would often be called on for babysitting. He said: “She was adorable growing up. When I was about 18 and Meg was three, I had a dog called Bo. She loved him like he was hers. The pair of them would never let each other out of their sights before curling up to go to sleep.”  Thomas Snr and Doria later moved with Meghan to Hollywood, but shortly after their relationship began to falter. They split by the time Meghan was six.

Now aged 96, George Johnny Johnson cruised in the cockpit of the heavyweight World War Two plane on Thursday.  He was flown by Tim Dunlop, bomber leader on the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and enjoyed spectacular lake and countryside views as the sun rose. The camera turns to Johnny, in the cockpit, who seems to be enjoying the special moment. The flight marked 75 years since RAF 617 Squadron attacked German dams using a purpose built \u0027bouncing bomb\u0027 on May 16-17 1943.  Many previous attacks had failed, so the specialist squadron was formed to utilise the opportunity to deliver a killer blow. At 9.28pm on Sunday May 16, 1943, as the sun was setting, the first of the 19 bombers rumbled off the runway at RAF Scampton into the Lincolnshire skies - and into the history books. Of the 133 men who took off on the secret mission - named Operation Chastise - only 77 returned. Fifty-three men were killed, three were captured and eight bombers destroyed. Now Johnny and Canadian air-gunner Fred Sutherland are the only two from the operation left.   Reflecting on the legendary Dambuster mission, Johnny told the Mirror this week : I’d lost a good friend, my room-mate Bernie, in a previous squadron.  His pilot overshot the runway on landing, went through a hedge and smashed the nose up. Bernie was still in the bomb-aimer’s position and was killed outright. By the time I got back, all his gear had been cleared away from our room. One minute he was there and the next minute, no trace of him. Just bad luck really, but you just had to go on and find another friend. That was how it was then. I just never thought it would happen to me.”  By the time Johnny arrived at his target, the Sorpe Dam, a number of planes had already been shot down or had crashed – killing many of his friends. The steep terrain, plus tall trees on one side and a church steeple on the other made it difficult to get low enough over the water for a successful bomb drop. He said: “We couldn’t make a head-on attack, so had to fly down one side of the hills, level out with the port outer engine over the dam itself, so that we were just on the water side of the dam, and estimate as best we could to the centre of the dam to drop the bomb.” Johnny ordered an astonishing nine runs at the target before, to the clear relief of the rest of the crew, he was finally satisfied with his aim and he released their bomb.

Emily de Luzy, 24, claims the former partner used to \u0027shame\u0027 her for her weight , despite her being only 12st, 8lbs, and a UK dress size 16.  She says she would do everything she could to hide her body away from the world after years of comfort eating left her unhappy with her looks. Known as the chubby one, she says mirrors were her worst nightmare, baggy clothes were her best friend and she would get called names. But after coming to terms with the fact she was using food to tackle her emotions, she has now dropped more than three stone.   Today, Emily worships and loves her body. She regularly trains in the gym, lifts heavy weights and has even become a bikini competitor.  I had a boyfriend who shamed me for my weight and openly admitted to me that throughout our relationship he fed me up deliberately because the fatter I got the less people would look at me, she recalled. I got called names in the gym when I was running on the treadmill at the beginning of my weight loss journey - I was always known as the chubby one. When I went on holiday with my friends, to get into the pool I used to get them to pretend to push me clothed so I didn\u0027t have to undress down into just my swimsuit.  I didn\u0027t have a relationship with my body before, we didn\u0027t work as a team. I would hide my body from the world and even from myself, mirrors were my worst nightmare and baggy clothes my best friend. Emily, from Horsham, West Sussex, started her fitness journey aged 19. She now weighs 9st, 2lbs, and has dropped from a size 16 to a size 8. I was out of shape before and I was so determined to prove the school bullies and people who had shamed me for my weight that I could get in great shape, she said. I started my journey at the age of 19 when I came to terms with the fact that I was overweight, unfit and was using food to tackle my emotions.  She went on to describe what her aims were when she decided to start going to the gym - and how she made them a reality. I decided to lose weight then to push it even further to compete as a bikini competitor and then sustain the physique I\u0027ve always wanted, she said. I\u0027ve lost five-stone, gone down four dress sizes and have gone through every emotion possible through trial and error of many diets, dealing with breaking habits and genuinely sticking at it to get to where I wanted to be. Now that I worship, respect and love my body it allows me to run long distances, lift heavy weights and jump around in training classes. I am proud of the body I was born with now and I am no longer scared of mirrors nor fitted clothes.  I tend to train in the gym four times per week which includes one to two hours of weight training or a functional session including a mix of resistance-based exercises and high intensity cardio. My calories vary depending on my week and if I am dieting for shows. Right now, I am currently eating 2000 calories plus per day and I still get hungry. Calories and food are our friends and I see way too many diets going around which include such low calories, our bodies aren\u0027t designed to live off restricted calories especially if we want to build some muscle and have a toned, balanced physique. My calories come from good food sources and provide me with all the nutrients I need to fuel me for my week both mentally and physically.  You hit some serious lows and some serious highs, you push your mind and body in ways it has not been pushed before. You have to put up with being hungry and over worked and you have to love your soul and your body before you begin to start dieting for any show. For Emily, social media plays an important role in what she does. I started my Instagram account as it allowed me to communicate with like-minded people and it also spurred me on to keep going as I would write posts informing my followers of my plans, she said. For instance, I once announced that I was going booze free for three months and I swear to this day that because of that and promising others I didn\u0027t have a sip for a whole three months.  Posting my journey via social media has definitely enhanced opportunities for me. I\u0027ve managed to connect with people from all over the world and now have a great platform to speak to people in the same position I was before I started my weight loss journey. A lot of people ask me how I do it and I\u0027m always honoured when people do ask and always try to encourage and advise others if they show an interest in my journey. She added: I\u0027ve had some bad reactions too, mostly from people who don\u0027t understand nor want to understand why I go to the gym and why I eat clean and healthy. Normally this is from people that from the outside looking in aren\u0027t overly happy with themselves. In all honesty I only surround myself with positive and supportive people and this is one thing I\u0027m incredibly strict on, no one needs bad eggs in their lives, so I make sure I have none in mine.

Young Gian Chetan\u0027s celebration boasted stilt-walkers, magicians, decorative thrones and a henna tattooist. And proud parents Anil and Radhika Chintamaneni, who spent seven months planning the party, say it was worth every penny. Radhika, 34, said her son loved the extravaganza, which happened back in February. The devoted mum, from Johannesburg, South Africa, said: “We always planned to just have one baby, so we knew before he was even in my tummy that his first birthday would be a grand event.  “He’s too little to understand at the moment, but we took about 800 pictures to show him when he’s older. “We want him to see how happy he was that day, and how much his mum and dad love him. He had so much fun and was smiling and playing all day. He didn’t cry once. Seeing him so happy made it worth every penny we spent. Amil, 38, explained that, being originally from India, it was traditional to have a big first birthday celebration. He added: “It’s part of our culture for a child\u0027s first birthday to be a real landmark. We saw it as celebrating the gift of our baby from God.”  Virtually as soon a little Gian Chetan arrived into the world, his parents set about organising his first birthday. Scouring the internet, they eventually came across Outlandish Events, a luxury events service based in Johannesburg, and enlisted their help. Together, they decided on a royal theme and began meticulously planning everything from the colour scheme to the entertainment.  “Everything was co-ordinated. We even matched what we wore on the day,” Amil added. After picking their venue – The View, a boutique hotel set on top of a stunning hillside in Johannesburg – the couple worked tirelessly for months to make their son’s day perfect. Upon arrival, the 200 guests were greeted by Mickey Mouse and handed welcome drinks, before heading in to the main party room, which was decked out with around 100 balloons, as well as a 3D flower wall. Two royal blue thrones were placed on a stage, next to a giant, ornate plaque, bearing Gian Chetan’s initials. “We also had a magician and stilt walkers for the children, chocolate fountains, cakes everywhere and even a tattooist - doing henna tattoos, not permanent ones,” Amil laughed.  Given a taste for party planning, the couple are hoping to organise another \u0027no-expense-spared\u0027 bash for Gian Chetan, when he is old enough to remember it. Amil said: “Perhaps we’ll do one on his third and fifth birthdays, so he’ll be a little older and know what’s going on. “I don’t think they\u0027ll be as a big as the first, though. We still want him to have an amazing day, but things will wind down from here. “We had a great time planning everything and making it special this time round. It was a day fit for a prince.” Proud mum Radhika recalled how guests at Gian Chetan\u0027s celebration said they had never been to a party like it.

Page boy Prince George was pictured behind his father as they left Windsor Castle in a black 4x4 this afternoon. Four-year-old George was sat in the back seat as they travelled home to Kensington Palace with less than 48 hours to go until the big day. His sister, bridesmaid Princess Charlotte, also attended the social gathering along with their mum, the Duchess of Cambridge, who gave birth to a third child, Prince Louis, less than a month ago. Meghan was all smiles as she arrived and later left a wedding rehearsal - just hours after telling the world her father will not be at the wedding.  The 36-year-old grinned as she and Harry, 33, were driven into Windsor Castle where the Queen is in residence and final preparations for the wedding at midday Saturday are taking place. A source said about Meghan: “She is concerned for her father but is also excited about her wedding.  “She has her mother all her friends around her and is very much looking forward to it.” Joining Meghan and Harry at the rehearsal were best man William and wife Kate along with their children George and three-year-old Charlotte. Earlier, the bride-to-be issued a moving and personal statement revealing her sadness at the fact her father Thomas Markle Snr is too ill to walk her down the aisle.  He told US website TMZ that he had stents fitted following a heart attack and will be in the hospital for “a few more days”. Meghan, who has been in tears with worry, said: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. “I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.” She added: “Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  Meghan’s Mum Doria Ragland is now the favourite to walk her down the aisle of St George’s Chapel. The social worker and yoga teacher arrived in the UK yesterday from her home in LA and is staying at Kensington Palace with Meghan and Harry. Shortly after touching down she met Prince Charles and Camilla for tea at Clarence House, which sources said she “very much enjoyed”. She was introduced to William and Kate and their children at Windsor Castle today, and will be accompanied by her daughter and future son-in-law when she meets the Queen for the first time tomorrow.  Doria, 61, will join Meghan at the Cliveden House Hotel in Berkshire the night before the wedding and will travel with her by car to the chapel.    Meghan’s announcement that her 73-year-old father will not be attending comes after days of confusion about whether he would make it. On Monday night he told TMZ that he was pulling out after the embarrassment over his staging photographs with paparazzi. On Tuesday he said he wanted to come and hated the idea of missing the chance to walk his daughter down the aisle. However, later that same day he told the website that he needed surgery following a heart attack and would not be coming to London.  It has since been revealed that worried Meghan called and texted him, telling him she loved him and was not annoyed with him about anything. TMZ\u0027s Sean Mandell told Good Morning Britain: “She has called him, she called him on Monday, after our first story broke... “But he did not have his phone on him at the time. “She then texted him saying that she loved him, she was concerned for his health, and that she bore him no ill will over the controversy surrounding the staged photos.  Thomas told the website he had three stents fitted, adding: “I’m OK. It will take a long time to heal. Staying in the hospital for a few more days. “Not allowed to get excited.” Meghan, meanwhile, was surrounded by her mother, close friends and future in-laws as final preparations were made for the wedding. This morning she is understood to have spent time with her best friends including stylist Jessica Mulroney and author Lindsay Roth before being driven to Windsor for the afternoon rehearsal.

The layers are sandwiched with buttercream and lemon curd. Some 200 Amalfi lemons are being used in the recipe, as well as 10 bottles of Sandringham Elderflower Cordial made using elderflower from the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, 20kgs of butter, 20 kgs of flour, 20kgs of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk.

The 14-year-olds were inseparable and would spend hours chatting, watching TV and listening to their favourite music. So when Freya was given a pair of Ariana Grande tickets for Christmas, she knew immediately she was going to share the experience with Nell. But what started as a fun night on May 22 last year ended in tragedy. Nell was one of the 22 people killed in the Manchester Arena terror bombing, while Freya was left fighting for her life. Her family spent days in a bedside vigil before being told she would likely never walk again.  Freya has now made an amazing recovery – but the pain of losing Nell remains raw. “Nell was so funny. She was hilarious,” says Freya, now 15. “If we were just talking I would be on the floor crying. We both loved pop music. Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande were her favourite people in the world. “At Christmas, I got Ariana Grande tickets and I decided to take Nell and give them to her as a birthday present. Dad drove us and we sang all the way, screamed. We had lost our voices by the time we got there, we were so excited. “But after, I thought she was in the hospital with me. And then my dad told me she had died. It was the worst moment of my entire life.” Freya had to cope not only with her loss but her own horrific injuries. Every part of her body was affected, with multiple fractures, cuts and burns.  She was determined to recover and is not just back on her feet but joining Sunday’s Great North Run to raise cash for Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, whose staff saved her life. Freya has so far raised \u0026pound40,000 – a remarkable feat for which she was named NHS Young Fundraising Hero at the first NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror. The moment the Corrie fan was given her gong by Louis Tomlinson, Kym Marsh and some of her favourite stars from the soap at the ceremony will melt hearts when it is broadcast on Monday. First, Freya thanked the hospital’s medics, saying: “I owe my life to you.” And then she dedicated the award to Nell, saying: “I miss you so much but I continue to look up to you and I love you.” For mum Alison, who was in the audience, there are few words to describe her pride. “Freya is a remarkable girl and has shown the most incredible strength,” she says.  “The fact she’s still here is an absolute miracle. We owe her life to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, which is why we are doing everything we can to help them.” Freya has been a fighter since birth, arriving seven weeks early. “She spent a month in hospital and grew into a strong-willed child,” says Alison. Freya, who dreams of being an actress, loved drama and music from a young age and was five when she went to her first concert, by Hannah Montana. “Freya started to like Ariana a few years back and I took her to see her the first time two years before the attack,” says Alison. “That night was the first time we let Freya go to a concert on her own with a friend. It was Nell’s first ever concert. For Nell not to come back and for Freya to come back the way she did… it’s just unbelievable.” Dad Nick was waiting in the foyer when the bomb exploded. “Nick rang to tell me there had been a bomb,” says Alison, still shaken by the memory.  “We didn’t find Freya for an hour. The feeling of losing your child is unimaginable. So to find out she was alive we felt someone was looking down on us.” Nick told Alison and Freya’s sister, Georgia, to meet him in hospital and the pair arrived 10 minutes before the ambulance. “That’s when I got to see the state she was in and that’s why we are raising money for the hospital,” says Alison. Freya had 10 hours of major surgery and was put in an induced coma. The medical team supported the family and were on hand when Freya’s parents had to tell her about Nell. “We were dreading telling her,” says Alison. But the staff helped her come to terms with the loss. “A lot of nights I couldn’t sleep properly and one nurse, Jenny, sat next to my bed and listened to me just go on about everything,” says Freya. The family were so moved they started a JustGiving page to help the hospital. Freya faced op after op but a visit from Ariana really helped in her recovery.

The Poseidon will be able to carry a nuclear warhead with a capacity of up to two megatonnes, a source told TASS.  The source said: It will be possible to mount various nuclear charges on the ‘torpedo’ of the Poseidon multipurpose seaborne system, with the thermonuclear single warhead... to have the maximum capacity of up to 2 megatonnes in TNT equivalent. With its nuclear munition, the underwater drone is primarily designed to destroy reinforced naval bases of a potential enemy, the source said. The drone will have a speed of 60-70 knots and will be operational at a depth of more than 1km.  TASS has not been able to confirm the information. Rex Richardson, a physicist, told Business Insider: A well-placed nuclear weapon of yield in the range 20 MT to 50 MT near a sea coast could certainly couple enough energy to equal the 2011 tsunami, and perhaps much more. Taking advantage of the rising-sea-floor amplification effect, tsunami waves reaching 100 meters [330 feet] in height are possible.”  The project of developing the Poseidon drone was unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin in his State of the Nation address to the Federal Assembly on March 1.  The Russian leader said that these drones could be armed with both conventional and nuclear munitions and would be capable of destroying enemy infrastructure, carrier-led naval forces and other objectives.

That is deliberate.“There will not be a big fence, but there will be a secure entry – a single way in and out. If anything, the entrance looks like a health centre.“It’s going to be staffed and have security on site 24/7. There will be shielding in the way of existing trees and additional planting. It will look like a domestic environment.”CCUs will house female offenders who are serving shorter sentences, or coming to the end of longer ones.About a third of the inmates – five or six at most – will occasionally go out into the community for work placements or activities.Some of those trips will be accompanied, while others will not but will have licensing conditions attached.Mr Fox made it clear there would be “consequences” for those who breach their conditions.Visitors will also have to abide by prison-style rules on visiting hours at the complex, which will close to the public at night, and locals will be able to call a 24-hour helpline, Prison Watch, should they have any concerns.SPS bosses hope that today’s information event will allay residents’ fears about the CCU, amid concerns about it bringing more crime into the area and denting house prices.Locals have also questioned the wisdom of placing a custodial unit next to a school – in this case, the Coldside Community Campus under construction.However, Mr Fox said that he had seen no issues in the area surrounding Cornton Vale women’s prison in Stirling – the predecessor to the CCUs.He said: “At Cornton Vale we’ve never had any problems with women going out into the community.“I also don’t think there is any evidence of facilities having an impact on house prices.“There has been an expansive range of housing built beside Cornton Vale after it was built. There’s a school beside it, which offenders walk past every day.“Do we recognise that people have concerns? Of course we do.“But letting people see what we are proposing is not what they expect is quite crucial. People get concerned when something new and unknown is proposed to them – that’s perfectly reasonable.“The fact we’re talking with the community, I think, means these concerns can be assuaged.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game.

This is why we ultimately all hear the same sound differently.“It’s an illusion that truly demonstrates that hearing is believing.”If you are tuned to more high-frequency sounds, or are primed by preceding softer vowels, you choose Yanny, if you are a liar you choose Laurel.\u0026mdash Tom Whipple (@whippletom) May 16, 2018Dr Elliot Freeman, a senior lecturer in psychology at City, University of London, says it is well known that we each have our own individual frequencies to which we are sensitive, which some refer to as “ear print”.He says: “Probably quite accidentally, this lo-fi synthesised voice contains sounds consistent with several different phonemes, like for example, ‘ya’ and ‘lo’, each occupying slightly different frequency bands.“Like a radio, our brains can selectively tune into them, once we know what to listen out for.“So even if both people are listening to the same sound, they might disagree because they just have different ear prints.”\u0026mdash Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) May 16, 2018And the device you are listening to might play a role, although Valerie Hazan, professor of speech, hearing and phonetic sciences at UCL, believes that’s only partly true.She says: “The reason that the illusion may vary according to how it is played can be because some speakers or headphones can boost the low or high frequencies favouring one or the other perception.”But she adds that perception can change, even in the same device.Prof Hazan says: “My own experience is that this morning I could hear 110% yanny and now, on same iPad and also via Twitter, I am hearing 110% laurel so the explanation is not as simple as a change in loudspeaker or headphones, although this could have an influence.”\u0026mdash Sherry Antonetti (@sherryantonetti) May 16, 2018Ultimately, she says, our auditory systems are flexible and individuals can vary in terms of which acoustic patterns they tend to latch on to.And because we were given a choice between yanny and laurel, our brain automatically narrowed it down to those two options.Prof Hazan says: “It is also the case that you are priming people to hear one word or another by telling them what the options are so that will also push them to perceive things they may not have without prompting.”So chances are, you may have heard a completely different sound or word, had those two options not been available.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7800652.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Major MOT test changes come into place this week -

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.
