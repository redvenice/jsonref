To avoid French inheritance taxes of up to 35 per cent. In a paper published in American journal Rejuvenation Research, Zak compiled a dossier of 17 pieces of biographical evidence supporting his \u0027switch theory\u0027, including inexplicable physical differences between the young and old Jeanne.         A Russian mathematician called Nikolay Zak recently alleged it was not Jeanne (right) who had died in 1997, but her daughter, Yvonne (left)He certainly has a point that Jeanne always seemed bizarrely youthful. Even at 90, she was slim, fit and lithe. When she hit her century, she was still cycling everywhere in smartly cut suits, heeled shoes and seamed stockings.It was only when she reached 110 — after climbing on to a table to try to unfreeze the boiler with a candle and starting a small fire — that she moved out of her grand apartment and into a nearby retirement home.Unsurprisingly, the French are very protective of Jeanne\u0027s memory. How dare this Russian upstart besmirch their homegrown \u0027Doyenne de l\u0027humanité\u0027 (oldest woman in the world).In fairness, it was a matter of pride rather than any fondness for the woman concerned. For Jeanne — a strident, bossy, haughty woman — had never been hugely liked.The daughter of a shipbuilder, she had led an unremarkable, cosseted life: she went to school, learned the piano and \u0027prepared for marriage\u0027 to her cousin, Fernand Calment, heir to a large drapery business in town.She used to recall that, when she was a teenager, van Gogh — who was painting in Arles — came to her family\u0027s store to buy canvases and her father waited on him.(Zak makes much of this — for Jeanne\u0027s father was a shipbuilder and the dry goods store in question actually belonged to her husband\u0027s family.)Meanwhile, marriage brought comfort, a houseful of servants and time to pursue her hobbies of tennis, roller-skating, cycling and hunting wild boar.But her daughter, Yvonne, was sickly and, in 1934, died — or not, as Zak would have it — leaving a husband, Colonel Joseph Billot, and a seven-year-old son, Frederic (Freddy), whom Jeanne and Fernand took in.         Zak insisted that Jeanne (pictured) seemed far too youthful to be 122Eight years later, Fernand died, too, and Jeanne and Freddy moved in with her son-in-law.(By Zak\u0027s reckoning, this was Yvonne moving back in with her own husband!)In 1963, she lost them, too. In January, Joseph died after a long illness and, in August, Freddy was killed in a car crash.In 1969, when she was 94, Jeanne sold her apartment to her lawyer under the French en viager system, where the buyer makes regular payments on a property in which the seller continues to live until they die.Or not, in Jeanne\u0027s case. She lived on, and on.When the lawyer died in 1995, he\u0027d paid more than £150,000 — far more than the property was worth — and never moved in.Even then, Jeanne didn\u0027t let his family off the payments, simply saying: \u0027In life, one sometimes makes bad deals.\u0027In the nursing home, where she was nicknamed \u0027La Commandante\u0027 by nurses, Jeanne insisted she be treated as though she were a guest in a hotel.As every birthday passed, so her fame grew worldwide. And she embraced it with enthusiasm.\u0027I waited 110 years to be famous. I mean to make the most of it,\u0027 she once said.She quit smoking when she was 117, declaring that, after nearly 100 years, it had \u0027become a bit of a habit\u0027. But she never gave up her daily glass of port.Finally, on August 4, 1997, after 122 years, five months and 14 days, Jeanne ran out of steam.She went to her grave having burned all the family documents two years previously, and was buried with Yvonne. She was the oldest validated human in history, finally at rest. Or perhaps not.Zak\u0027s theory can certainly be challenged. To start with, Yvonne would have had to pretend to be her own father\u0027s wife. And Frederic, her seven-year-old son, would have to have been in on the lie. And all for the sake of inheritance tax the family could surely have afforded?Team Jeanne counter that an official verification of her age confirms her truth. Conducted over the course of a year in 1995, when she turned 120, she was asked questions about documented details concerning relatives, and about people and places from her early life, and passed with flying colours.But there is room for doubt.Jeanne\u0027s eyes were documented as one colour in the Thirties on an identity card, but were reportedly green in later life.She was always petite, but didn\u0027t lose height as the very elderly — especially women — do as their bones weaken.And, possibly most intriguing of all, there was the strange decision to have all her papers and family photographs burned in 1994 when Arles officials asked to include them in the city archives.Perhaps more convincing is Zak\u0027s refusal to believe anyone could live that long. After all, in the two decades since Jeanne\u0027s death, no one else has come close to her record.Team Jeanne insist their heroine was simply unique.She lived well, they say, was never ill or overweight, regularly exercised her mind and body and attributed her youthful complexion to a daily dab of olive oil and a puff of powder.But, in truth, it\u0027s a mystery that will endure for ever."},{"url":null,"title":"Chocolate company bosses planning launch vegan friendly version classic Dairy Milk bar","story":"Share this article But it has yet to find a dairy substitute that also caters for people with nut allergies, the Sunday Telegraph reported.It comes as more consumers opt for vegetarian diets and baker Greggs introduced a vegan sausage roll last year to great acclaim.Cadbury\u0027s dropped its decades-long \u0027glass and a half\u0027 slogan – the amount of milk in each bar – in 2010 to comply with EU metric regulations.US firm Mondelez, which also owns Toblerone, admitted it was looking at a plant-based version.          It comes as more consumers opt for vegetarian diets and baker Greggs introduced a vegan sausage roll last year to great acclaimA spokesman said: \u0027We\u0027re always listening to our consumers, so we can develop and provide people with a greater choice. \u0027This includes looking at a plant-based Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. However, we have no immediate plans to launch.\u0027We are only interested in launching a new vegan product that retains the texture and taste that our consumers love.\u0027It brought out a version with 30 per cent less sugar last year.

People go on retreats, join religions, cushion themselves in headphones or lose themselves in novels. We counter the rush-hour stampede with a walk in the park, and against the public squall of political debate we set the private consolation of poetry. In an age of mayhem, everyone needs ballast and, for most people, I would guess, that ballast is made of several different things. Near the top of my personal list: photobooks. I take a photobook off the shelf and spend 20 or 30 minutes with it, and this brief immersion provisionally repairs the world.It might be a book I’ve already looked at many times – which is even better. I’m not talking about simply looking at photographs. There are photos everywhere, and most of them are like empty calories. Many photos, even good ones, tend simply to show you what something looks like. But if you sequence several of them, in a book, say, or in an exhibition, you see not only what something looks like but how someone looks. A sequence of photographs testifies to a photographer’s visual thinking, a way of seeing revealed through choices of colour, subject, scale and perspective. The photographs encountered in an exhibition might be beautiful new prints or vintage ones imbued with the aura of originality. But there are disadvantages to exhibitions: they can be noisy and crowded, open during inconvenient hours and have closing dates. With a book, though, the images and the photographer’s arrangement of them are yours for all time.The photobook was born, by one account, when Anna Atkins made an album of her cyanotype studies of British algae in 1843. Henry Fox Talbot began to issue The Pencil of Nature, with tipped-in calotype images, the following year. It did not take other photographers long to seize on commercially distributing their photography in book form. The middle of the 20th century saw the publications of Henri  Cartier-Bresson’s The Decisive Moment (1952) and Robert Frank’s The Americans (1958), and those two books, in strikingly different ways, became the looming influence against which almost all subsequent photobooks were measured. Even today, ask photographers what sent them down their chosen path and one or both of those books is likely to be mentioned as exemplars. The strength of the inidual pictures is central to the success of a photobook (The Americans, like The Decisive Moment, is almost nothing but winners), but there are photographers of genius who have never made a truly great photobook at best, they have made books of their great photos, which is a different matter.What makes a photobook great is how well it combines a large number of variables: the paper print quality stitching and binding the weight, colour and texture of the cover the design and layout of the interior the size and colour balance of the images the decision to use gatefolds or to print across the gutter the choice to include or exclude text and, if so, how much of it, where in the book, and in what font the trim size and heft of the book even the smell of the ink! Every great photobook is a granary of decisions, an invitation into the realm of the senses. If a poem is great, I’m indifferent to the design choices made for the book in which it is published, unless the design is particularly atrocious. But I can tell whether a photobook has been meticulously made, or is merely a pile of pictures printed one after another. Truth be told, not all photographs in a photobook need to be great, and the real artists of the form know how to aerate their stupendous images with less forceful transitional ones.But what a joy it is when all of those decisions seem right, when the print quality is meticulous, when a book crying out for matte paper is made with matte paper, when the colour profile favours magenta over yellow, or cyan over magenta, depending on what the pictures need. The experience becomes multidimensional, and the memory of the work becomes idiosyncratically specific. I think not only of certain photographers’ styles, but also of the tactile and sensory trace of their books. The luxuriously uncut double pages of Rinko Kawauchi’s Illuminance are as much a thrill to the hands as her glimmering images are to the eye. Liz Johnson Artur’s self-titled book has a flawless combination of colour images with those in black and white, the better to convey the effervescent generosity of her vision. The stippled deep purple cover of Gueorgui Pinkhassov’s Sightwalk is a braille-like prophecy of the delirious scatter of light within. These qualities are more enduring than whether a project is “important” or not. Investigative reports are important, but in our intimate moments it is sensibility that best restores us to our human selves. This is not to downplay the ethical dimension of photography, but to suggest that the ethical flourishes best when the formal conditions are in place to protect it.Of all the elements that make a photobook truly special, the most important is the order of the images. Look at this, the photographer says, then look at this, then look at this one. All books are chronological, but the feeling of being guided, of being simultaneously surprised and satisfied, is particularly intense in photobooks. I think of Masahisa Fukase’s legendary Ravens (1986), which is largely about the titular birds. It is gloomy, making great use of blur and nocturnal shooting, with a black and white palette, and set entirely in Japan. I thought about Ravens a lot when I was preparing Fernweh, though my book is superficially very different: set in the Swiss landscape, shot mostly in clear bright colour in summer weather. I was aided by the way Fukase looked and looked again at the ravens, finding remarkable new ways to think about those unsettling birds. In one magical sequence, an image of a congress of ravens in the snow is followed by one of a single wing against a white field, followed by a photo of numerous corvid footprints on a lightly snowy surface, the footprints startlingly like the shapes of the birds themselves. And so, black on white was followed by black on white, which was followed by black on white – a virtuoso display of analogical thinking. This is language without words. Elsewhere, among many pictures of ravens, a sinister-looking cat suddenly appears and then a nude sex worker, and later an almost abstract closeup of a plane in flight. The trust in variation is wonderful. I tried to keep that trust in mind in making Fernweh.In a world of deafening images, the quiet consolations of photobooks doom them to a small, and sometimes tiny, audience. They are expensive to make and rarely recoup their costs. In this way, they are a quixotic affront to the calculations of the market. The evidence of a few bestsellers notwithstanding, the most common fate of photobooks is oblivion. But it is precisely this labour-intensive and financially unsound character that allows them to sit patiently on our shelves like oracles. Then one day, someone takes one of them off the shelf and is mesmerised by the silent and unanticipated intensity. (The experience of reading a novel, by contrast, is not so silent, for the reader is accompanied by the unvocalised chatter of the text.)Time with a photobook is a wander off the beaten path, and hardly a day goes by that I don’t reach for one. This enjoyment cannot be dispatched with a “like” button. The photobook won’t send you ads based on how long you linger on a given page. It doesn’t track you. (No one knows, for sure, how many times I have looked at Guido Guidi’s Tomba Brion.) It is resistant to gossip and allergic to snark. Sitting with it, you have to sit with yourself: this is a private experience in a time when those are becoming alarmingly rare, an act of analogue rebellion in an obnoxiously digital world. Sure, one could look at a sequence of pictures on a digital device, but to do so would be to indulge a poor facsimile like frozen pizza, instant coffee, or artificial flowers.The book, the actual book, is the thing. From your library or from someone else’s, you might pick up Dayanita Singh’s Museum of Chance or Stephen Shore’s American Surfaces, Rebecca Norris Webb’s My Dakota or Gilles Peress’s Telex: Iran. The book you choose might be by a little-known photographer it might have been printed by a small press or a large publishing house it might be a limited edition, an out-of-print classic or a surprising newcomer. But now you’re holding it, and what it promises is relief: the outside world falls away, the eye scans the image, you sense the paper on your fingertips, you feel the optical information spreading into your brain, you hear the sound of the turning page, you see the next image, you become aware of your own calm breath.• Fernweh by Teju Cole is published by MACK, £35."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81afe0f1e0681fe822edac39928492fdc3e69682/108_0_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a16f5320bbeeeeb69fc90e4324241759","title":"the mirror and the light hilary mantel review","story":"The long-awaited final part of the Booker-winning trilogy is a masterpiece that will keep yielding its richesSo the trilogy is complete, and it is magnificent. The portrait of Thomas Cromwell that began with Wolf Hall (2009) and continued with Bring Up the Bodies (2012) now concludes with a novel of epic proportions, every bit as thrilling, propulsive, darkly comic and stupendously intelligent as its predecessors. “Concludes” is perhaps not the word, for there is no tone of finality. Cromwell, Lord Privy Seal, deputy head of the church in England, chief minister, second man of the realm, Cremuel, my Lord Cromell, Crumb to friends, has a great deal of business to do, through 900 pages, before we contemplate endings. The heights of his power are all before us, and though he likes ladders he prefers to think of wings.Bring Up the Bodies closed with bloodshed and wreckage. “But it’s useful wreckage, isn’t it?” and now Cromwell uses it, strenuously remodelling catastrophes as opportunities. Over four years, 1536-40, his tasks include the seemingly impossible. He must reconcile Lady Mary to her father the king, bring down two of the most powerful families in Europe, turn monks into money, prevent imperial invasion, organise a new queen. Taking opponents in his grasp like the snake whose poisoned bite he once survived, he must manoeuvre his arch-enemies the Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner. Cromwell lives these years with henchmen at his back, and guards at every door. “The times being what they are, a man may enter the gate as your friend and change sides while he crosses the courtyard.” As for clothes, best try a reversible garment: “one never knows, is it dying or dancing?”We can already tell the shape of this book. We see that the crowd dispersing after Anne Boleyn’s execution in the opening pages (“time for a second breakfast”) will gather again at its close. Working with and against our foreknowledge, Mantel keeps us on the brink, each day to be invented. “Scaramella’s off to war,” hums Cromwell, a tune from his Italian youth. You need a war-song to go into dinner. This is what it’s like to be at the centre of power in Tudor England, and also a particular understanding of what it is, anywhere, to be alive.The Mirror \u0026amp the Light is generously self-sufficient – to read this alone would hardly be skimping: it is four or five books in itself. But it also continues, deepens, and revises its forebears, negotiating with its past as does Cromwell with his. A spring lightly touched opens corridors into earlier books. Unlock the “room called Christmas” now and its past leaps out: this is where the doomed lutenist Mark Smeaton shrieked through the night among festive decorations that appeared, in his terror, as implements of torture. We know our way around Austin Friars and what these walls have seen. “My past pads after me, paws on the flagstones,” thinks Cromwell, who builds new houses and watches old ghosts enter. He knows the power of palimpsests. His Reformation involves the whitewashing of walls, but he sees how old faces show through from underneath. The Mirror \u0026amp the Light is startlingly fresh in every moment, a new-made story with predecessors close enough to bleed through the pages.Mantel’s Cromwell, now in his 50s, keeps the same daunting schedules as ever through 18-hour days. Lawyer, banker, chief diplomat, he is master of the grand scheme and every last memorandum. “Bear in mind,” he tells a friend and spy, “my field of interest is very wide.” He knows the price of wool and alum, and market values in the court’s “inner economy” of gossip and shame. He has drained the roads, reintroduced beavers, grafted better plums. And still his life depends entirely on Henry’s favour. Should the king die, or withdraw his love, all is lost. A moment’s inattention and the structure falls: hence the difficulty of sleep, hence the disaster of illness in which, through absence, one loses the advantage. “You are one man,” says Margaret Pole: “Who follows you? Only carrion crows.”She is restating the terms of class warfare. The central conflict between the self-made blacksmith’s son and his aristocratic opponents (Norfolks, Courtenays, Poles) intensifies along with Cromwell’s power. As his chief of staff Wriothesley correctly observes, “The higher you rise in the king’s service, the more you mention the low place you come from.” His country, too, is obsessed by the relationship of class and power. The labouring rebels who march in the Pilgrimage of Grace uprising cry vengeance on the “vile blood” of any lowborn who tries to rule them. In Cromwell’s rearrangement of hierarchies, intelligence is all those not clever enough to save themselves are not worth sympathy. Yet if he is the figurehead of a new meritocracy, he badly compromises his position as he funnels influence into his own family, bringing a new dynasty into being.Though many readers have responded to the modern secularity of her fictional Cromwell, Mantel has always been firm about the strength of his religious conviction. Here she puts the evangelical cause at the centre of his life’s work. He is a heretic, and acts on it, risking everything for the gospel translation he wants to see in every parish and for his country’s alliance with Europe’s Protestant centres. Among the book’s most complex and fascinating subjects is the character of the Reformation that he passionately apprehends.Modern times may sharpen our sense of Cromwell’s internationalism. If his England is to prosper, it must join every conversation across the courts and marketplaces of the continent. He employs in his household the best linguists to be found. As a boy in the kitchens of the Frescobaldi banking house, he was promoted upstairs for his quick wits and knowledge of the English used on the docks and streets Wolsey employed him for his Italian now he calls on ruffians and survivors from across the world to work for him.As much as this is a book about statecraft, international relations, class, faith and power, it must count, too, among the most penetrating studies of professional friendship: the complicated, unequal relations of masters and servants, tutors and proteges, kings and their ministers. “Henry and Cromwell. Cromwell and Henry”: they step apart from the court to talk alone, needing each other in desperate though different ways. Cromwell’s most vehement love and loyalty, however, belongs to a dead man, Thomas Wolsey: his teacher, employer and elected father. It is the quietest but perhaps the most acute calamity of the novel when Wolsey’s ghost ceases to talk, leaving him “without company, without advice”. He can but turn to those he in turn has sponsored. Rafe Sadler, Thomas Wriothesley: “he has trained them, encouraged them, written them as versions of himself”. Watchfully, appreciatively, quelling hindsight, the novel asks what they have learned.“There is nothing against the recreation of the dead,” Cromwell says, “as long as they are plausible.” He has just employed Holbein to paint the past kings of England, inventing their unknown faces. It’s as if he is glancing towards Mantel, signalling permission. Where evidence survives, she uses it where there is silence, she offers deeply informed guesses about the world as it looked to him. It’s characteristically bracing of her to consider the horror of finding that one’s life is wrongly told: Cromwell has forced on many victims an “estrangement of self” and suffers in his turn from contortions of evidence, wilful misreadings. Of the book’s many mirrors, this is the most disturbing: the glass in which the truth of your life is stolen away and reconfigured. Mantel’s project is to offer a clearer reflection, a more plausible hypothesis, a more telling illumination.She is still exuberantly rethinking what novels can do. Not since Bleak House has the present tense performed such magic. The narrative voice rides at times like a spirit or angel on thermals of vitality, catching the turning seasons, the rhythms of work and dreams, cities and kitchens and heartbeats. Mantel did not have much to learn about scene-setting or dramatic timing, but her involvement in the staging of Wolf Hall, and the experience of watching the television adaptation, may have contributed to an ever-finer honing of dialogue. In a room at the Tower, in the time it takes to burn two candles, a prisoner’s silence mounts towards confession. On a thundery midsummer night, talking quietly in a garden tower at Canonbury, eating strawberries while the moon comes up, two men arrange the future “a hair’s-breadth at a time”.Endings, insists Cromwell, are opportunities. What begins now is the rereading. For this is a masterpiece that will keep yielding its riches, changing as its readers change, going forward with us into the future.• The Mirror \u0026amp the Light is published by 4th Estate (RRP £25).

It was originally published in Pearl in the Silver Morning (Poetical Histories, No 49, Cambridge 1999). The new selected poems also includes a substantial number of the earlier Pearl poems, and this context makes Daft Patter all the more moving.Although MacSweeney wrote it towards the end of his life, the reader soon discovers it is not some throwaway, self-mocking, self-pitying, alcohol-heavy exercise in nostalgia. “Daft” of course means “silly” and “patter” is a word we connect most frequently with the comedian’s clever shtick. It’s a title ostensibly shrugging off the lure of romanticism, and at first the gloom deepens as MacSweeney summons Pearl’s own “sullen loneliness”. There’s a kind of reduced pastoral, as if the Northumbrian landscape were stripped of its earlier physical and emotional riches. “Yet there’s a grin in the wind …” The defiant assonance (grinwind) already warms what is “heartless and cold”. Affirmation begins to ironise the irony of the title.The diction throughout is a reminder of the vivid idiolect of the MacSweeney voice. It doesn’t use the full Geordie dialect, but is steeped in vernacular colour. This poem asks to be read aloud. The punctuation is purposefully erratic: the rhythmic exchanges of pause and flow are always audible. A grammatical “slip” in the last line (“the lights of all you didn’t say knots my life and all dreams”) works brilliantly to multiply the light and the knots.Darkness becomes visible in the witty tautology of the third line, and what I think is the metaphorical vehicle for the speaker’s work of difficult remembering, mining. His hands-on process is luminously enacted in the line “I low my beams to you, from tunnel to tunnel”. The transitive use of the verb “low” instead of the conventional “lower” reminds the ear of the mournful sound of cattle, and jogs the eye to see an act of deep stooping, a humbly adoring “bow”. The presence who emerges, or surfaces, “as if the frozen air had a distinct personality” seems at this point to be both the speaker and the addressee. “Pearl” has been identified with the young woman who, deaf and unable to speak, was taught by a very young MacSweeney to read and write. The proud and sturdy assertion against his lover’s muteness, “But you had sound  all sound”, gains from our knowing that background.Pearl’s looks and sounds clarify through brief observations, tenderly amused comments, and a tone of lovely, forthright realism. The mood intensifies, the diction glows. And sounds, sharp, heavy, hard, and very unlike the ripple of “patter”, form into one epiphany after another: “You sawed my glance  in half with yours”, “I now know why you took the sickle hook  backing the beasts into their shutdown shed”. The narrator also rejoices in the sounds the woman makes with her own mouth and tongue – “my purr mistress  my fantastic slaver merchant”. The dialogue shared by the lovers fuses his (so-called) “patter” and her “slaver”. There’s also a dialogue between the colloquial and the slightly more literary voice, the latter influenced perhaps by a much earlier Pearl.MacSweeney ends by building a crescendo of affirmation. Another tautology adds a subtle chord: the couple are “together”, and “together” they possess “togetherness”. One of those flaky, dullard words, “togetherness” is seriously redefined and made honest.As the poem gains energy, it tells us that intense experience may take shape in the mind again and again: it’s never lost. Memory, for ever young and volatile, stamps its immediacy on to the hesitation and disintegration time and suffering bring. While hints of struggle can be felt in the poem’s efforts both towards and against logical structure, the voice comes through, fiercely plain despite the orchestration of sound, triumphantly alive in the “frozen air”.The 20th anniversary of Barry MacSweeney’s death will fall in May this year. It’s high time for a new generation to discover his work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6acbc6086367c8739b1a4c7d0ba0ca3dcbad008d/36_0_4652_2792/master/4652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ef49ad360772d4b8dc72f57481ab18c","title":"female superyacht captains our mission is to rewrite the narrative","story":"Top women sailors launch drive to help schoolgirls choose careers that take them to the helm of the sailing industryJenny Matthews and Natasha Ambrose are embarking on an unusual world tour: encouraging schoolgirls to consider careers as superyacht captains.“I wanted to know if there were any other women officers out there,” she said. “It took a long time to find any official statistics, but research by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency shows that just 60 women have qualified as senior yacht seafarers since 2006, out of a total of 1,210 people. Our mission is to rewrite the narrative of women in maritime by raising visibility and awareness.”Matthews, who is from New Zealand and joined the superyacht industry as a stewardess when she was 18, said: “I’ve got to be honest with you – it’s tough to get a job, full stop. This industry is highly competitive with so many people wanting to work in it. And being a female wanting to work in a more male-dominated role can be very challenging.”Matthews said raising awareness that women can be captains and chief engineers was a key part of the campaign. “Some people may say, ‘Why would I consider a woman to be my deckhand? I’ve never seen it. She is obviously a stewardess.’ It all comes back to the core perceptions people have about what jobs people should do based on their gender, not what they could be good at.“It’s unconscious bias. It can even happen to me when I see a female captain – I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s so cool.’ But it shouldn’t be, it should be a normal thing.”The women said their campaign was inspired by Kate McCue, the first woman to captain a “mega” cruise ship, and similar efforts to raise the visibility of female commercial airline pilots.McCue has built up a following of more than 100,000 people on instagram detailing her life as captain of Celebrity Edge, a $1bn 130,000-tonne cruise ship with capacity for 2,900 passengers.Ambrose, 32, from Chichester, West Sussex, said a core part of the She of the Sea campaign was to let schoolchildren know that working as an officer or engineer on a superyacht sailing the world was a viable career no matter their gender – if they worked hard at maths and science.“The only way to really change things is to get people enthused when they are young,” Ambrose said. “Our phrase is, ‘If she can see it, she can be it,’ and we’re planning our own roadshow to schools in the UK and across the world to encourage girls to study science, maths and engineering so that they can take career paths like this.”The She of the Sea campaign also aims to connect and support women already working in the industry. “It’s about letting people know that they’re not alone, and we are here for each other,” Matthews said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c611be3cc600b1f506aab54b08bc7445fd681e8/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91468650c4b41a0751836070002c34b","title":"estate agents countrywide lsl merger hamptons your move","story":"Tie-up between owners of Hamptons International and Your Move could result in job lossesTwo of Britain’s biggest estate agency groups are in talks over a possible £470m merger that will bring together well-known brands such as Hamptons International and Your Move and could also mean job losses.In a brief statement to the stock market, Countrywide said that “it is in discussions with LSL Property Services regarding a possible all-share combination”.

There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.The group, which maintained its overall financial guidance for the full 2019-20 year, said it was working closely with its suppliers in China to assess the impact of the virus on their factories and supply chains and their ability to fulfil its current orders.“If delays to factory production are prolonged, the risk of supply shortages on some lines later this financial year increases,” it said.“We are assessing mitigating strategies, including a step up in production from existing suppliers in other regions.”The ABF finance director, John Bason, said Primark was talking to suppliers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Turkey and eastern Europe to fill the potential gap, although he said some items manufactured in China could not be replicated.“There are in accessories or whatever, areas like that, that China is very good at that are harder to source from elsewhere ... So I’m not guaranteeing that we can replace all of the shortfall from China,” he told Reuters.ABF also owns major sugar, grocery, ingredients and agriculture arms. Several of its food businesses have operations in China.It said the China sugar processing campaign was completed in January before the coronavirus outbreak developed significantly.However, its AB Mauri, AB Agri and Ovaltine factories are operating at reduced capacity because of labour and logistics constraints caused by the virus outbreak.Bason said the impact was not material to the overall group.For its first half to 29 February, ABF forecast sales and operating profit ahead of the previous year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47b93509cd6f468e33c21d151587a289d475c1d/0_342_1454_872/master/1454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9748f67e9d38c21620a0b51443527244","title":"tesco launches range of plasters to match different skin tones","story":"Supermarket’s own-brand product available in light, medium and dark shadesThe UK’s largest retailer Tesco is introducing a range of plasters to match different skin colours and better reflect racial and ethnic ersity.In a supermarket first, its new own-brand fabric plasters, available in light, medium and dark shades, go on sale in all 741 Tesco stores nationwide and online from Monday.Tesco developed the plasters after a member of staff spotted a now-viral tweet last year, when a black American man described his emotional response when he first used a plaster on his cut finger that matched his skin tone.His tweet prompted a flurry of comments from other users, highlighting how significant the issue of representative plaster tones is for those in black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Some said their memories of putting on plasters as children were when they were first made aware of race.The thread, which received more than 500,000 likes, even attracted the attention of actor John Boyega, who posted his own experience of “nude” plasters while filming Star Wars.The product idea was brought to the attention of senior Tesco team members who accelerated its launch. The development of the plasters was supported by the BAME at Tesco staff network, who helped with testing and feedback and had an input into the product’s final design.Paulette Balson, the chair of the network, said: “No UK supermarket had ever stocked plasters in a range of skin tones before and we saw this as an opportunity for Tesco to lead the charge and make a genuine difference. Through our research, we know how emotive a product like this can be. For example, one colleague reported that their child had felt self-conscious wearing a plaster on their face to school recently, because it didn’t match their skin tone and stood out.”In the UK, there is little product choice from mainstream retailers. Boots does not stock plasters in multiple tones, although it does sell transparent ones, which can be used on all skin colours. Specialist brands can be bought online but they are relatively expensive, while the Stickyskin range was launched in the UK nearly 10 years ago.Nicola Robinson, health, beauty and wellness director at Tesco, commented: “As one of the largest retailers in the UK, we understand that we have a responsibility to ensure our products reflect the ersity of our customers and colleagues.“We believe the launch of our new skin tone plaster range is an important step and a move that we hope will be replicated by other retailers and supermarkets across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43889542fdcbbdd48498a2ab03198999ea5f0a2/0_39_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcc979ea215e6b84fd0de21cc2cd1081","title":"uk public spending to top 1tn a year thinktank forecasts","story":"Boris Johnson is planning to ramp up government borrowing to spend more than £1tn a year, increasing the size of the British state to make it bigger than at any point under the 10-year premiership of Labour’s Tony Blair.Analysis from The Resolution Foundation predicts government spending will rise above the £1tn mark for the first time in history by 2023-24. The report, published on Monday, comes as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to deliver what is widely expected to be one of the most expansionary Conservative budgets in a generation.Jack Leslie, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the plans marked a major shift for the traditionally small-state Tory party. “The chancellor’s big-spending plans to ‘level up’ the country through infrastructure projects will lead to a bigger state than at any point under Tony Blair,” he added.However, the thinktank warned that the money for extra spending would probably require tax increases unless Sunak broke budget rules drawn up by his predecessor, Sajid Javid, before the former chancellor’s dramatic resignation earlier this month.The drive by Johnson’s government to increase spending to close gaps between the richest and poorest regions of the country with greater investment in transport and major public works follows promises made at the election. Johnson’s party attacked Labour’s spending plans as reckless during the campaign, warning that the “cost” of a Jeremy Corbyn government would have been £1.2tn.Any extra spending would still not undo a decade of cuts under the Conservatives, according to the foundation. Setting aside the department for health and social care, reversing even half the cuts to other departments would cost around £24bn. Extra spending on welfare to prevent further increases in child poverty would cost around £5bn more.Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of activity in the economy over a given period of time.\u0026nbspPut simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.\u0026nbspGDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.\u0026nbspThe ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number.• The value of all goods and services produced – known as the output or production measure.•\u0026nbspThe value of the income generated from company profits and wages – known as the income measure.•\u0026nbspThe value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas – known as the expenditure measure.Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation.Britain\u0027s government statistics body, the\u0026nbspOffice for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.\u0026nbspThe ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.\u0026nbspThe most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year for the three months to March, June, September and December.The figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here. GDP per capita shows whether we are actually getting richer or poorer, by stripping out the impact of population changes. Richard PartingtonHe added: “We all know what happens when those facts are ignored: more borrowing, more debt.”With just over a fortnight until the crucial first budget of the new parliament set against the backdrop of Brexit, the thinktank said Sunak would probably be handed a modest boost from the Office for Budget Responsibility.While suggesting Sunak could just about stay within these constraints while lifting government spending beyond the levels seen under Blair’s Labour government between 1997 and 2007, the thinktank warned it would leave the chancellor with little room for manoeuvre.It said the headroom would be less than a third of the buffer earmarked by former tory chancellor Philip Hammond. Should public borrowing rise by more than expected, the government may need to raise around £19bn of additional tax income, it added. Leslie continued: “If the chancellor wants to increase spending on day-to-day public services in a fiscally responsible way he will have to change another of his party’s traditional priorities – lower taxes.He added: “Higher spending will require higher taxes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3d403745378cdc83aedf4d00bc3836840a6c32/0_126_5193_3115/master/5193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb93f427e7a97d92f7e47067f4d82e04","title":"the guardian view on irans elections a closing door","story":"Iran’s election on Friday was a blow to moderates, a disappointment for conservative rulers and bad news for the region too. The result was largely ordained before anyone could cast a ballot. Hardliners appear to have swept the parliamentary contest – taking all 30 seats in Tehran – because the authorities ensured that they would.  Council, which is loosely under the control of the supreme leader, had disqualified around half of the thousands of candidates for the 290-seat body, including 90 serving members. While parliament’s powers are limited, it can impede the president and shape the political environment with a presidential race due next year, the result sets a course for conservative control of every branch of government – as seen during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s grim tenure.The frustrations found an outlet in November’s brutally suppressed protests – the third outbreak of unrest in as many years – and have only grown since then. The shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane, which Iran denied for days before admitting responsibility, prompted fresh protests and further exposed the rifts between and within the country’s institutions. Now a coronavirus outbreak, the deadliest outside China, is spreading in a country where the health system is already under immense strain due to sanctions. It will also deepen economic woes: on Sunday, Pakistan and Turkey announced they were closing their borders and Afghanistan said it was suspending all travel to and from the country.Domestic incompetence and corruption have unquestionably contributed to the hopelessness that so many Iranians feel today. But it is above all the Trump administration’s choices – in walking out of the JCPOA, imposing punishing sanctions and assassinating General Suleimani, arguably the second most powerful man in the country after the supreme leader – which have tightened the grip of hardliners and strengthened the belief that cultivating its nuclear programme and its proxies is a better bet than counting on meetings with western diplomats. A vital opportunity has been squandered, and Iranians are paying the price. Others may do so too.

But there are no quick fixesSince Labour’s election defeat in December, the party has managed to agree on one thing: that a “period of reflection” is necessary. But while everyone accepts reflection is required, there are, predictably, wildly varying ideas about what form it should take.One option is to lament the kind of party Labour has become. On BBC’s Politics Live, communications consultant Deborah Mattinson asserted that Labour, apparently once the “pie-and-a-pint party”, was now beholden to the whims of north London quinoa munchers. (Never mind that you can get a quinoa salad in any Wetherspoon pub.) Well-worn as this spiel is, Labour’s base still consists of the kind of people you’d broadly expect: workers, students, renters, the disabled and unemployed.All this has been part of the pageantry of Labour election defeats for decades. When Labour lost three successive elections in the 1950s, its revisionist right wing sought unsuccessfully to drop Sidney Webb’s clause IV, with its famous reference to “the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange”. Another generation of revisionists finally did away with it, after a string of four election losses, in 1995. Heavy on symbolism, Tony Blair’s “clause IV moment” entered the political lexicon but probably had less to do with Labour’s landslide win two years later than Black Wednesday, which had already wrecked the Tories’ reputation for economic competence.Demands for Labour to move right are a perennial reflex reaction in the wake of election losses. They often bear little relation to the concrete circumstances of specific defeats: after the 2015 election, for instance, Labour was again being urged to shift right, this time on public spending, migration and social security – even though the party had spent the previous five years emphasising its toughness in exactly those areas. And the party responded to its defeat by abstaining on the Tories’ welfare bill at its second reading that July – in order to show voters, as Harriet Harman, the interim leader at the time, put it, that the party was “listening” to them.The Labour left’s idea of reflection following the defeats of 2010 and 2015 differed greatly from that of the right. It meant defending the more progressive achievements of the Blair and Brown governments – rejecting Tory fallacies about their supposed fiscal profligacy and, in the case of 48 MPs, defying the whip to vote against the welfare bill. But it also meant faulting other aspects of New Labour such as private finance initiatives, the introduction of university tuition fees, and the catastrophic invasion and occupation of Iraq. The left argued that during 13 years of Labour government an opportunity for a more far-reaching transformation had been passed up and that the party had become dangerously remote from its supporters, a diagnosis borne out by the events of subsequent years.Genuine reflection today, after yet another defeat, requires a good-faith assessment of what Corbynism did right and wrong – how its failings might be addressed and its positive achievements built on. Jeremy Corbyn had some success in challenging pro-austerity narratives, forcing the Tories to abandon their own position, at least rhetorically. But after 2017, when Labour almost made a shock breakthrough, the party’s left wing tended to assume that the hard work of persuasion was done – badly underestimating just how far popular political expectations had been lowered over the preceding 40 years.No one can be in any doubt, then, that Labour has to earn public consent for any ambitious programme of social reform. The party thus needs to consider how it builds support for such a programme among the people it aspires to represent, and how to make it relevant to their specific needs. The reversal between the elections of 2017 and 2019 was sudden, but long-term trends were also at work: for four decades, the labour movement has been steadily disappearing from everyday working-class life across much of the UK, with old loyalties dissipating. Nandy seems to see the significance of this, but she appears more comfortable with identifying problems than proposing solutions.Labour’s community organising unit has made a tentative start on repairing Labour’s links to its base, and may have helped stem some losses in December. However, its success cannot be judged in electoral terms alone: community organising is also about facilitating a direct dialogue between the party and the people, one that isn’t conducted via the distorting prism of media preoccupations.The danger now is that the party neglects its fledgling community work and instead, traumatised by its recent treatment in the press, tacks right in the flailing pursuit of more favourable headlines. A bruised party membership, still stinging from a bad defeat, may be tempted to go along with this. But having lost under leaders from the party’s right, centre and left in the past decade, there are no quick fixes for Labour’s present predicament.• Tom Blackburn is a founding editor of New Socialist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7e4bd3dd3473480ea26b7dd15c9cce552af878/3_0_1697_1018/master/1697.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4005fced70034cb6521918d265b7b011","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of luck","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘luck’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘luck’.Share your photos of what luck means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 February at 10am.

But is the audience for them drying up?Dark Waters must be the least Todd Haynes film Todd Haynes has ever made. Based on the true story of a corporate lawyer (played by Mark Ruffalo) who switches sides to expose pollution by the DuPont chemical company, it is powerful and creditable, but does not feel like the work of the man who gave us the lush, stylised likes of Carol and Far from Heaven. It feels more like an Oscar-bait issue movie in the mould of Erin Brockovich. Except with Dark Waters, the awards panels didn’t bite and neither, going by US box-office numbers, have the public. The formula has stopped working, but the films keep coming.Which is why we need to talk about Participant Media. Participant was founded in 2004 by eBay billionaire Jeff Skoll with the noble intention of producing movies with “socially relevant themes”. By many measures, it has succeeded. Participant has received 74 Oscar nominations and 19 wins. Its documentaries have included An Inconvenient Truth, Citizenfour and this year’s Oscar winner, American Factory. It has also had a hand in hits from Good Night, and Good Luck to Lincoln to Roma, and often backed up its movies with campaigning on the issues they raise.At its best, Participant hits that sweet spot between commercial appeal and “social relevance”. At its worst, it has become an issue-movie production line. Its technique is well established: take a true story, ripped less from the headlines than the features section of the New York Times attach a respected director and some well-meaning A-listers and churn out an earnest, liberal-leaning dramatisation. Before Haynes, there was Richard Linklater (Fast Food Nation), Gus Van Sant (fracking drama Promised Land), and the man behind Brockovich itself, Steven Soderbergh (Matt Damon whistleblower movie The Informant!). This awards season, as well as Dark Waters, Participant had a hand in fact-based legal drama Just Mercy, starring Michael B Jordan and Jamie Foxx. It has met a similar fate.Perhaps Participant’s formula has polluted the issue-drama waters, but indifference to films such as Dark Waters is also a symptom of a blockbuster-saturated marketplace. That sweet spot between commercial and worthy barely exists now. Instead, Participant has been supporting schmaltzier fare such as The Help and Green Book. It is not as if interest in socially relevant stories has waned, but they are now made as straight documentaries or small-screen series.Maybe they are not what cinema does best. For comparison, 25 years before Dark Waters, Todd Haynes made a brilliant film about health and paranoia: Safe, starring Julianne Moore. It was too vague and unsettling to tick the “social relevance” box, but it somehow encapsulated its time. That is what great film-makers can do, when they are trusted to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3019111ff814273f8d2e148d0fcce5cb814516e/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976b13a129e28d5e5951cc9c7c1db60b","title":"premier league talking points weekend action","story":"Burnley discover depth up front, Manchester City take care of business and Southampton unearth a potential gemMikel Arteta is entitled to be pleased with three wins in eight days, but must also reflect on the sloppiness which gifted Everton two goals. Though Arteta said that in the first 65 minutes they played exactly as he wants them to, the reality is that Arsenal flowed for perhaps half that time, hanging on to the points not because of any great discipline and organisation their opponents just finished poorly and Bernd Leno had a good second half. And Leno’s response, when asked about his mistake which led to Everton’s equaliser, was telling: Richarlison, its scorer, was “lucky” he, its unwitting victim, was “unlucky” and it didn’t matter in the end, because Arsenal won. This is not how winners think, and this is the mentality Arteta must change, but if he is as delighted with his team’s performance as he intimated, he would do well to re-evaluate his own too. Daniel HarrisMatej Vydra is currently only playing because Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood are injured, but with two goals in two games the Czech striker is going to be hard for Sean Dyche to leave out, particularly as he plays so well alongside Jay Rodriguez. Burnley actually have four effective strikers at the moment, and that does not include Dwight McNeil who is becoming noticeably better at playing through the middle, but Dyche maintains whoever plays up front must have an understanding with his partner. “If you are going to play two up front they cannot operate as iniduals, they have to connect,” the Burnley manager said. “I’m really pleased that Matej has come in and done well, because he’s been waiting and waiting for his chance. He’s stretched the pitch and connected well with the others. He puts in a lot of work and his finishing is sublime.” Paul WilsonIt has not been easy for Olivier Giroud to accept his diminished role at Chelsea this season. The striker has not even made the bench at times and it was difficult to understand why Giroud ended up staying at Stamford Bridge last month. Against Tottenham, however, the Frenchman showed he is a better deputy for Tammy Abraham than Michy Batshuayi. It was only Giroud’s third league start under Frank Lampard, and his first since he struggled in the defeat to West Ham in November, and he was outstanding in a crucial Chelsea victory. He bullied the Spurs defence, scored a cracking goal and combined with Ross Barkley and Mason Mount for Marcos Alonso’s decisive strike. Now Lampard has a tough call to make: does Giroud keep his place when Chelsea side host Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday or should Abraham return after shaking off an ankle injury? Jacob SteinbergSteve Bruce’s admission that he may have to consider a change of approach following the abject defeat to Crystal Palace could be good news for Newcastle’s forgotten man Dwight Gayle. The former Palace striker made his first appearance for six weeks at Selhurst Park having recovered from a hamstring injury and Bruce is now hoping he can finally get the opportunity to show his ability after being sent on loan to West Brom last season by Rafael Benítez. “I don’t know how many times I’ve said in the last few months – I’ve gone on record to say I tried to buy him three times,” said the Newcastle manager. “Unfortunately, since the day I walked into the club he had a calf injury which never got any better. Then he did his hamstring. Dwight is a very good player and a natural goalscorer. It would be a welcome boost for us if he was available to us for the rest of the season.” Ed AaronsAfter a week of endless public arguments about every facet of the club aside from the actual football, Manchester City took things back to basics on Saturday by executing two of their defining features to near perfection: they missed a penalty and they suffocated a top rival with their possession. City grew into the game and they created numerous opportunities in the second half until Gabriel Jesus finished a lovely move created by Riyad Mahrez, wrapping up a sufficiently positive performance before a meeting with Real Madrid that carries even greater importance after the Champions League ban. “Do you still doubt about what they’ve done?” asked Guardiola after questions about the team’s attitude. Cutting through all the noise to focus on winning is part of the job description of professional players, but to see it in motion is impressive all the same. Tumaini CarayolMason Greenwood’s rocket of a finish was his 11th goal of the season in all competitions and fifth in the Premier League – making the 18-year-old one of Europe’s most prolific teenagers. As Ole Gunnar Solskjær said after the game the boy from Bradford is only going to improve. “He is the best finisher we have and one of the best I have seen, right foot, left foot, doesn’t matter,” the United manager said. “He knows how to score. He is just so sharp in and around the goal. What pleased me more is his link-up play, his switches of play he found Daniel James from right to left. The whole season he has had says a lot for him. He is just going to be better and better. He is only 18 and is not fully grown. Not like Wayne Rooney was at 18. In a couple of years’ time he will be more or less the complete No 9 or forward.” Jamie JacksonCompromise is sometimes seen as a dirty word in football but Graham Potter is far too shrewd, and sensible, to fall into that particular trap. Potter’s Brighton have played some aesthetically very enjoyable stuff this season but results have not always matched performances and relegation fears are rising. On Saturday he recognised the need to dust down his, much more pragmatic, predecessor Chris Hughton’s old playbook and grind out a precious point against dynamically dangerous opponents chasing an unexpected European dream. Aided by the use of three different formations– all based on a back three – during the 90 minutes, plus some untypically direct passing and in depth defending, Brighton duly achieved their aim courtesy of Neil Maupay’s equaliser at the end of a classic route one move. There were spells when Sheffield United had them on the ropes but the resilience of Potter’s players suggests survival should be secured. Louise TaylorArguably the biggest boon from Southampton’s win over Aston Villa was the performance of Will Smallbone on his league debut. The midfielder, who turned 20 on Friday, was assured, unfazed and quietly knitted things together for a dominant Southampton side, delicately shifting possession and almost opening the scoring when he hit a post. James Ward-Prowse was excellent at full-back, Michael Obafemi arrived off the bench and Matt Targett lined up against his former club at St Mary’s, but Smallbone, who joined Southampton as an eight-year-old, was the academy graduate on the lips of supporters at the final whistle. “I knew before this season that he would play a few Premier League games, that was clear,” said his manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl. “It’s good for him and for every young player at the club. If they are good enough we won’t be scared to let them play. This must be our way for the future.” Ben FisherIt would be fascinating to sit in on a recruitment meeting at Wolves. Not one that discussed inidual targets, rather the strategy that has brought the club such success. The sort of meeting that Jorge Mendes might dial into. When hiring from Portugal, as Wolves have been inclined to, what marks out a player who could make the transition from there to here? A Ronaldo and not a Renato Sanches? Diogo Jota is an intriguing case in point. The 23-year-old is now in his third year in England and with five goals in three days he is Wolves’ man in form. Against Norwich he ran the regarded Ben Godfrey ragged with his pace and close control, while his first strike was superbly executed. But as with his strike partner Raúl Jiménez it is often his strength and determination in the challenge that makes the difference. Finding that sweet spot between technical gifts and physical graft is one of the secrets of Wolves’ success. Paul MacInnesThings could have been very different in the career of Kasper Schmeichel after he left Manchester City back in 2009 to recently-monied Notts County in League Two, as City looked away from homegrown stars to more expensive acquisitions. In Nottingham, Schmeichel got games under his belt, even if the club went nowhere. It was easy to see such a level was way below the Dane’s talents ever since he has been a beacon of quality and consistency for whichever team he played for, proving it once more with a stunning performance against his first club on Saturday, including a fine penalty save. Not only is he one of the league’s best goalkeeper’s but also the most inspiring of leaders and he would not be out of place as Manchester City’s No 1 over a decade after leaving but he looks very content with his lot.

A recent conversation over drinks with Mike Dean convinced the veteran of more than 600 games to realise that referees are human just like the rest of us, rather than unthinking, emotionless, card-brandishing cybernetic androids who simply materialise, fully formed like some sort of buzz-killing fun-assassins dispatched Terminator-style from the future.A man who does not so much polarise opinion among football fans of various teams as pull off the impressive feat of completely uniting it, Dean once found himself the subject of an unsuccessful petition signed by more than 100,000 Arsenal fans calling for him to be forbidden from refereeing any more of their team’s games. Renowned for his showmanship, occasional pomposity and apparent desire to be the centre of attention in any match he is tasked with officiating, he has for some time now been the best known and most unpopular of England’s top-flight refs.It wasn’t ever thus, however. As an overweight, teenage couch potato on the Wirral in the mid-80s, Dean decided to take up the whistle, cards and notebook in an effort to shed some excess weight. Working his way through the ranks while holding down a full-time job as a mass-executioner of chickens in a processing plant, he swapped fowls for fouls on a full-time basis after 16 years. He has since gone on to become one of the most disrespected match officials in the country, the prevailing opinion of football fans being that he is truly terrible at his very difficult job. He isn’t, of course, but that’s beside the point. Despite the occasional high-profile rick, the very nature of refereeing suggests you don’t become as well known and reviled as Dean has over the years without doing plenty right.“I’m sort of seeing the person behind the ref, y’know,” said Crouch to his co-presenters following Dean’s guest appearance on the most recent episode of the BBC’s That Peter Crouch Podcast. “I never really thought about what he did. In 1985 he started his referee’s journey when I was four years old and he’s still reffing at the highest level now, at 51. You have to give him some kudos for that. I never thought of the journey, or how he’d got there and I’m a little bit ashamed of that, honestly.”Given the infrequency of public utterances from match officials, getting Dean to appear on his podcast was quite the coup for Crouch and his backroom team even if one could be forgiven for suspecting their guest didn’t take much persuading. Premier League referees are currently forbidden from speaking to the media immediately after games, on the grounds that their boss, Mike Riley, head of the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, believes they could be too emotionally involved in “what they’ve just been through” and might say something ill-advised.In a world where Dean’s colleague Jon Moss recently came under fire for mildly mocking Bournemouth’s Dan Gosling, it is difficult to imagine the more garrulous Dean being reluctant to pass up the opportunity to grab the microphone firmly with both hands to explain himself in the wake of a contentious match. He certainly wasn’t backwards in coming forwards with his opinions on That Peter Crouch Podcast, although the convivial, laid-back tone of the show meant he was unlikely to be subjected to a particularly tough grilling.Having originated as a vehicle for its likeable star to provide his unique and amusing insights into life as a professional footballer, the show’s decision to provide a working referee with the opportunity to lift the lid on his day-to-day life proved something of a masterstroke. Invited to demonstrate he is not the show-stealer bloated with self-regard many perceive him to be, Dean did not exactly go out of his way to disabuse listeners of any such notions.“There’s a touch of arrogance about me when I walk out on the pitch I know there is,” he said. “But it’s also a lot of confidence in myself because I believe in my own ability.” Moments previously, having explained that the passing of time means he is no longer able to run as far or as fast as he used to, Dean had explained “without being big-headed” that he can “make decisions from 30 yards away and the players turn around and because it’s me I’ll get away with it”.Despite his high opinion of himself, Dean did come across as being extremely likeable, good naturedly detailing – among other vicissitudes of the job – the tedium of constantly being “booked” by beermat-brandishing pub-goers when trying to enjoy a night out with the wife. As Tranmere’s most famous fan, he made headlines last May when footage emerged of him ostentatiously cheerleading in the away end at Forest Green after his side secured their place in the League Two play-off final. For all his grumbling about lack of originality, one suspects he will be even more forlorn when the beermat-waving stops.In recent years it has become fairly customary for many live-match broadcasters to have a former whistle blower on hand to explain contentious decisions, albeit cloistered alone in what looks like a cupboard all the better to emphasise their pariah status. Fitness permitting, Dean hopes to put next season behind him before retiring but revealed his dread at the prospect of no longer being able to do his job. “God knows what I’ll do when I can’t referee again,” he told Crouch and his cohorts, although – like the man on whose podcast he guested – it’s difficult to imagine a man of his high profile remaining sidelined for very long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbea0790edcc41c1d224328f52546678870a0277/0_82_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=febe02f66b55ebb29e4e4e31a1f17f52","title":"coronavirus china wuhan lockdown economy south korea npc annual parliament","story":"Communist party expected to reveal whether it will delay annual parliamentary sessionAn announcement that the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak would relax some of its travel restrictions and allow some people to leave was made without authorisation and has been revoked, the local government said on Monday.Authorities in Wuhan had said healthy residents could begin to leave the city, which has been under strict quarantine measures since 23 January. But later on Monday afternoon, a new statement declared the previous notice “invalid” and said all relevant personnel had been “severely criticised and dealt with”.The contradictory statements will cast doubt on attempts by officials at the national level to assure the public that the virus is being contained. The later notice called on Wuhan to “firmly implement” Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s “important instructions” on preventing the export of the virus to other parts of the country.Wuhan’s government said it would continue to impose strict controls over its borders in order to prevent the virus from spreading further. At the national level, China’s National Health Commission reported its highest number of deaths in 11 days on Monday, with another 150 dead and 409 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China to 77,150. All but one of the fatalities and 11 of the new infections were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak.Elsewhere, South Korea reported 70 more cases of the virus, bringing its total to 833, and Afghanistan identified its first case, as reported cases outside China jumped.In Italy, authorities have implemented draconian measures to try to halt an outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas, as a fourth person was confirmed to have died there. And Iranian state TV said the death toll in the country has risen to 12, after four more people died.Chinese officials had delayed the daily announcement of the data, a day after a major speech and meeting held by Xi, who warned the Covid-19 crisis was “both a crisis and a big test” for the country, according to Xinhua News agency.Xi said the virus was a major public health emergency, which had spread quickly, causing the most extensive and difficult-to-contain infection since the founding of the People’s Republic of China.“The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,” Xi said, but added that the impact would be temporary and generally manageable.Some observers greeted Monday’s figures with scepticism and as part of efforts to project a sense of control over the crisis. Chinese officials have twice changed the criteria for confirmed infections, making the data harder to parse.An announcement on whether the party will delay next month’s annual parliamentary session as a result of the crisis was expected on Monday. If it is moved, it would be the first time the meeting has been postponed since the Cultural Revolution.On Monday, the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Shanxi lowered their alert levels , following Gansu and Liaoning over the weekend.China has allocated 99.5bn yuan ($14.16bn) to curb the outbreak, China’s assistant finance minister Ou Wenhan said in a Beijing press briefing on Monday.Officials from the World Health Organization visited Wuhan on the weekend for the first time since the outbreak, inspecting two hospitals and meeting officials at the centre for disease control in the province.There is growing alarm among economists and investors that the impact on global growth is going to be much worse than has previously been estimated.Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP wealth management in Sydney, said it was likely the Chinese economy will have contracted in the March quarter.There is no official data about how the Chinese economy has fared in the past three weeks, but trackers of coal consumption and traffic congestion show that the world’s second-biggest economy is still paralysed despite claims that many manufacturing areas are back to work.“The presumption was that we would see intermediate supply chains quickly reconnected and I think the market’s had to go through a period of questioning that logic” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.The new spike in cases in South Korea on Monday, which brought the national total to 763, prompted shares to fall in Australia and Hong Kong. One of the nation’s largest cities, Daegu, has been placed under semi-lockdown, its national assembly session has been cancelled, and the start of school postponed. Other nations have also begun to suspend flights into the country. South Korea’s K-league postponed the start of the new football season in the face of the growing outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3451bb991d97cc7a3e14c831d851f1f2961dd98f/0_363_3702_2221/master/3702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18120b8c54fe49cfaa505409356f7a3e","title":"somalia edges closer to first democratic election in half a century","story":"Landmark law expected to replace clan system and lay groundwork for long-awaited ‘one person, one vote’ pollThe president of Somalia has signed a landmark federal law, paving the way for the country to hold its first popular election in half a century.A long awaited “one person, one vote” election could be held by the end of the year.“It is such a historic time for Somalia, this bill will give Somali people the right to political participation, which they have been denied for 50 years,” said Halima Ismail, chair of the national independent electoral commission.The law is expected to replace the existing clan-based, power-sharing model, which gives the country’s main clans equal representation in government.The proposed system would still ensure clan representation in parliament, however, which has raised concerns about the potential for continued marginalisation of minorities and women. Analysts have questioned whether the country is ready for a popular election.The last time Somalia had a universal suffrage election was in 1969. Following that were decades of dictatorship, civil war and relentless terrorist attacks.In a desperate attempt to stop the bloodshed and restore law and order, Somali leaders – with backing from the UN – agreed on a clan-based form of governance known as the “4.5 system”. Under this system, parliamentary seats and most government positions are ided equally among the four major clans, with the remainder allocated to a cluster of minority clans.This model, which was meant to be a temporary measure to mitigate clan conflict, has become a never-ending problem.“It is unfortunate that we are still talking about 4.5 clan elections,” said Ismail. “It is not a viable option. People should be free to elect the person they want based on merit, someone they can hold accountable, but this primitive clan system is taking us back whenever we try to move forward.”Somali women have long struggled to navigate a male-dominated culture where traditional tribal elders select their representatives in parliament, excluding them from decision-making.But there has been significant progress in recent years thanks to sustained campaigns by Somali women and pressure from the international community, which has been supporting the country’s nascent democratic progress.“Women are powerless only when they are outside the political space,” said Ikraam Hirsi, who was among a wave of young politicians who dared to challenge the status quo in the last election.“But once we are in the parliament we have equal votes and have even proven to be more capable and more committed than men.”The passing of the law is seen as a milestone by the government and its international partners but many critics, including major opposition leaders and federal member states, say they have not been fully consulted on the changes. “Given the current political and security situation, a one person, one vote election does not seem feasible,” said Abdimalik Abdullahi, a Somali political analyst. Of particular concern to the opposition parties is article 53 of the electoral law, which says elections will be postponed in the event of a national disaster such as floods, famine or armed conflict. The article is seen as a mechanism that the government could use to extend its term.Earlier this month, the regional government of Puntland closed the offices of the national independent electoral commission and called for a meeting of the federal member states to discuss critical issues about the elections and the country’s federalism project.“Puntland administration had closed our offices but they have not boycotted Somalia’s general election,” said Ismail. “They have called for an inclusive dialogue and we hope something good will come out of the expected talks.“As a commission we have made all necessary preparations for a general election. Every technical detail has been put in place, but it is up to the Somali political leaders to come together and reach consensus on the way forward. If only there is political will among the Somali elites, then it is possible to hold a one person, one vote election by the end of the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37639810605f77c273d38c41296f22437dfefe70/0_220_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ff4844196d88066867201a31a0c315f","title":"venezuela children minors brazil migration","story":"After six years of economic crisis in their neighboring country, Brazilian officials say more and more unaccompanied minors are arrivingJesús Pérez was 16 when he crossed into Brazil in June, fleeing a life of hunger on the streets of his disintegrating homeland.In Pacaraima, the Brazilian border town that is the main entry point for fleeing Venezuelans, he told social workers he hoped for a fresh start.Those dreams were short-lived. Less than four months later, on 7 October, Jesús’sdisfigured corpse was found dumped in a wheelbarrow near an army-run shelter for refugees in the Amazon city of Boa Vista.Police have yet to catch his killers but suspect he was murdered by members of Brazil’s biggest drug faction, the First Capital Command (PCC), after racking up a debt of just over £50 ($65).Nonato Souza, who runs the government refuge where Jesús had lived, said the murder was an extreme example of the dangers facing young Venezuelans escaping into Brazil.But after six years of economic meltdown in Venezuela, Brazilian authorities say they are witnessing the arrival of more and more unaccompanied minors such as Jesús.Between July and December last year, at least 422 Venezuelan children and teenagers entered Brazil through its northern border without their parents or s, according to the public defender’s office. Some were as young as 11.A recent report by the Venezuelan investigative news website Armando.info said 25,000 unaccompanied minors had left since 2015, mostly for Colombia and Brazil.The surge in arrivals has been such that the UN’s agency for children, Unicef, recently opened two homes in Boa Vista, the nearest major city to the border, to cater specifically to young migrants.“They come to Brazil hoping to find some kind of work, to survive and to help their families back in Venezuela,” said Ligia Prado da Rocha, a public defender who monitors incoming minors at the Brazilian border.Rocha said most of the underage and unaccompanied arrivals were – like Jesús – boys aged 15 to 17 who often ended up being exploited on the streets of Boa Vista.But younger children were also coming as Venezuela’s economic implosion intensified.“In December, an 11-year-old boy and his 14-year-old cousin came over on their own to Pacaraima,” Rocha said. “They said they’d been living on the streets in Venezuela for a while and wanted a better life in Brazil.”Venezuela’s teenage refugees are impossible to miss on the streets of Boa Vista, a small city in Brazil’s Roraima state that has borne the brunt of the worst migration crisis in modern South American history.Officials say a total of 60,000 Venezuelans have arrived here since the global collapse in oil prices in 2013 sent their country into an economic nose-e.On a recent evening half a dozen teenage boys battled for the attention – and charity – of drivers near the city’s bus station, their nationality betrayed by their Spanish pleas for help: “Una ayuda, patrón!”Luis said he had abandoned Venezuela last October, leaving his 11-month-old son, Esdras, at home with his mother in order to seek food and work in Brazil.These days he sleeps on a sliver of cardboard on a wasteland by the bus station. “What’s my biggest dream? I’d never thought about it,” he said. “Probably to see my son and my mom doing OK.”Daniel, 16, arrived at the Brazilian border last August, penniless and starving, having been robbed of what few possessions he had while hitchhiking there on a truck.He grew up in the city of San Félix, but was forced on to the streets at the age of 12 by the collapse of both his family and his country.After three years of living on the streets, he headed for the lawless gold mines of south Venezuela, where he spent six months before deciding it was too dangerous.In January, with the help of social workers, he managed to enroll himself in a Brazilian primary school where he, too, is hoping for a new start.“The thing I most want to do now is study,” Daniel said. “I want to make up for all the time I have lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b573f96b2cdf763721e1802e26259f2a795305/0_122_5620_3374/master/5620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2100f62355d5c4cddb91dfb5271a675f","title":"five ways improve flexibility","story":"Try tai chi, pilates or yoga to boost strength, eat enough protein, and dissolve tension in a warm bath. And give it time – make it part of your lifeYoga, pilates, tai chi and stretching are all recommended for improving flexibility by the NHS. While pilates and yoga concentrate on building strength and flexibility, yoga is generally regarded as having a deeper focus on increasing the range of joint motion. “Within the physical movements, there are lots of opportunities to elongate the muscles,” says Chris Magee, head of yoga at Psycle London. Tai chi loosens muscles and stretches the whole body. It is especially useful for people with limited mobility, recovering from injury or balance problems as it can be adapted to suit a range of abilities.There are no direct links between diet and improved flexibility, says Claire Fudge, clinical dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, but including good-quality protein post-exercise, as part of a balanced diet, is a good move. When collagen, which is made from the building blocks of protein, is combined with vitamin C, it may help to decrease joint pain, supporting tendons and aiding recovery, says Fudge. “While it won’t be a wonder cure for making someone more flexible, it may help reduce muscle soreness after exercise.”Stretching is crucial, but not doing it for long enough is a common mistake, says Dr Tony Kay, professor of biomechanics at the University of Northampton. “Most people only hold a stretch for five to 10 seconds, but if you want to affect the stiffness of the tissues, it needs to be for quite a bit longer.” Dr Polly McGuigan, senior lecturer in biomechanics at the University of Bath, agrees, explaining that there are differing opinions on the duration of a static stretch, but she recommends around 30 seconds.“Flexibility is not something you can change quickly,” says Mcguigan. “It takes time and a concerted effort with a static stretching programme.” How flexible you need to be depends on your lifestyle. Generally, for day-to-day activities, repeated essential tasks, such as bending down to put on socks, is enough. In a sporting environment, it depends on the type of exercise, says Kay. Tennis, squash, running, gymnastics and martial arts are among the sports in which an increased range of motion helps to reduce the risk of injury.While a warm bath or shower may have more of a psychological benefit, Mcguigan believes it is worth a try. “One of the things that you have to overcome in stretching and increasing flexibility is the muscle’s natural protective response. So if you can relax the muscles via a warm shower or bath, you could potentially get more out of your stretches because you are starting with nice, warm, relaxed muscles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88acb8a71beaa58b2cc2c131286167ea5ad7f8ca/0_351_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a834c5ce8ba7619896a6dbaa4d3fa335","title":"10 biggest myths in fitness scales are pointless","story":"With new exercises invented every week, new gurus trending by the day and a fresh study that contradicts all the other ones released every time you think you’re getting the hang of things, it’s easy to think that fitness is confusing – but it isn’t.The fundamentals stay the same, and the science is pretty well agreed – so by simply arming yourself with a few basic facts, you can step into any gym forewarned against whatever fresh nonsense the #fitstagrammers are preaching. These are the 10 biggest myths in fitness – exercise your synapses for a couple of minutes by memorising them, and do your curls with confidence.Yes, there’s something masochistically satisfying about limping your way down a flight of stairs the morning after a big legs workout, but delayed onset muscle soreness – Doms to its Insta-buddies – isn’t actually a convincing indicator of progress. It’s thought to be caused by micro-tears in muscle, and tends to crop up when you do movements you’re not used to, when you deliberately slow down the “eccentric” (or muscle-lengthening) part of whatever move you’re doing (such as the downward bit of a squat) or just do a ridiculous number of reps. Conversely, then, you can eliminate soreness almost entirely by keeping the reps low, or doing moves that don’t have an eccentric, such as throws and sled pushes. There is such a thing as pain-free progress.There are two key ways to get stronger: increasing the size of your inidual muscle fibres, and recruiting more of them to fire together when you need to use them. The first is what bodybuilders aim to do, but the second is what your body would do – automatically – if you had to lift a car off a loved one. In sports where excess size is a negative, it is what competitors teach themselves to do. This is how female Olympic weightlifters in the lighter weight categories can outlift larger men. Getting big requires specific, targeted training, including lots of volume and extra calories and protein – and it almost never happens by accident.This one’s been popularised by modern fitness gurus, who will (fairly sensibly) point out that weight isn’t a true measure of progress, as fluctuations in the amount of water being retained can lead to day-to-day shifts in the numbers, and putting on muscle can lead to the numbers going up while you’re making progress in the right direction. This doesn’t mean you should toss away your scales entirely. “Yes, you have to understand that short-term fluctuations are inevitable and don’t represent changes in body fat,” says Emma Storey-Gordon, the trainerowner of ESG Fitness. “But, over time, changes in scale weight are predictive of body fat. Even if you are also building muscle, the rate at which you can lose fat will be much quicker than the rate at which you can build muscle.” Don’t become overreliant on them, but scales can show whether you’re moving in the right direction.Actually, it’s more like the opposite: properly done squats will strengthen the stabiliser muscles around your knee joints, safeguarding you against injury as well as making you a bit more capable of bounding up escalators. As for running, a 20-year study conducted by Stanford University found that consistent runners (many of whom were well into their 70s by the time the research period ended) showed a lower incidence of arthritis than non-runners as they aged. It also showed that runners have a lower risk of osteoarthritis and hip replacements, suggesting that pounding pavements isn’t actually as bad for you as advertised.While we all lived in the offline wilderness, the myth persisted that you could, for instance, target the fat around your midriff by doing hundreds of situps. That myth has been mostly wiped by the ubiquity of the internet, but replaced by the more subtle half-truth that it’s possible to single out problem areas by thinking hormonally: that since, for instance, the stress hormone cortisol causes belly-fat buildup, a bit more sleep and a few sessions on the Calm app should see your abs emerge. And while this is technically, sort of, true, deliberately messing with your hormones is tougher than advertised and not really advisable. “The truth is, we all have stubborn fat areas that seem to take the longest to get lean,” says Storey-Gordon. “There are various reasons for this – hormones and sex both play a role, for instance. These can’t be easily changed, so you can’t really choose where you lose fat from. Don’t give up, though. Stubborn areas will get leaner alongside everything else. Patience is the key.”CrossFit and endless neon-tinted, EDM-soundtracked fitness classes have made “rest” a four-letter word in the fitness industry, but constant movement for the sake of it could actually be hindering your gains, not helping them. “For most people – especially beginners – periods of recovery between sets or intervals allows for higher-intensity, better-quality movement, lower risk of injury and a greater training stimulus that is likely to lead to superior results,” says the performance and wellbeing coach George Anderson. Or, in other words: if you push yourself for an hour straight, you’ll be forced to lift lower weights, go slower and generally put in less work than you might with some strategic downtime. And the optimum varies – for fat loss, anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds between sets is ideal, but for strength you might spend five minutes preparing for ultra-intense efforts.As sparse-and-spartan gym spaces emphasising basic barbell movements have proliferated, so, too, has the idea that using machines to train is at best inefficient, at worst dangerous. Machines force your body into awkward, over-linear movement patterns, goes the theory – reducing the input from important stabiliser muscles and stopping you from moving naturally. But while there is some truth to this, not every machine is the enemy. “Whether you’re a time-poor, technique-free novice or a more advanced lifter, machines can involve less setup, allow more work and provide extra stimulus to isolated muscle groups,” says the trainer Dan Osman. That said, the leg press is no substitute for learning to squat properly.Once, the four-minute Tabata – 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest, repeated eight times – seemed the logical endpoint of the workout-shortening craze, with claims that it could replace much longer training sessions while offering roughly the same benefits. Now it seems almost glacial, with three, two, and one-minute workouts promising to harness high-intensity interval training’s (HIIT) mystical powers and leave you more time for Candy Crush. The truth? Anything is better than nothing, and it’s certainly possible to make some gains in whatever limited time you have, but longer workouts have effects that no micro-workout can mimic. Oh, and by the way: in the original Tabata study, the test subjects – who were professional cyclists – worked so intensely that some of them refused to countenance trying the protocol again. If you’re not doing that, there’s no guarantee it will work as advertised.Is running better than lifting for longevity? Do you need the mobility yoga offers more than a really jacked set of quads? Is Zumba just a waste of valuable time that you could spend boxercising? “Whatever training style you experiment with, you’ll find someone ready to argue that everything else is useless and stupid, that you should stick with them or go home,” says Dr Michael Banna. “This kind of absolutism risks deflating people by telling them that their efforts have been pointless. The reality is, any physical activity has health benefits the right type is the one that doesn’t injure you, make you sad or make you want to stop.” Ideally your physical activity should include a mixture of cardio, resistance and mobility work spread across the week – but do what you enjoy. • Joel Snape is a former editor of Men’s Fitness and runs the website LiveHard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87d356d42c534d96d506ff0f649ebf1e044772d/0_472_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebbab276015f897d41807f3eda0820a7","title":"my boyfriend wedding dress unveiled shortcomings masculinity","story":" I’m quick to blame men for their toxic behavior, but in this case, I, the woman, was part of the problemMy gaze scanned the colorful racks of clothing and stopped abruptly on something I’d never expected to see: my boyfriend was clutching a wedding dress – that he wanted to buy for himself.“Emily!” he cried with victorious glee. “I’ve found the one!”Ian thrust the white garment into the air like a Nascar trophy. Its lace sleeves sashayed from the tapered bodice and fluffy tulle grazed the dirty tiles of the thrift store floor. A smile stretched across Ian’s scruffy face and his blue eyes danced with the giddy excitement of a bride saying, “I do!”“Oh, wow,” I managed to spit out.We were at Goodwill searching for dresses to wear during the annual Mother’s Day Climb up Mount St Helens, a decades-long tradition in which everyone scaling the volcano that day sports flowing garments in honor of female mountaineers and mothers everywhere.I knew Ian would be among the most outrageous on the mountain. My boyfriend is aggressively fun and a flair fanatic, which I find wildly attractive on most occasions – like when he’s scaling technical slopes in jorts and a cat shirt or skiing the steepest lines in the Pacific north-west in space tights.But I found myself unexpectedly uneasy with his new fondness for feminine frocks – a reaction that challenged the progressive ideals I’d prided myself on for decades. I’d long thought I was contributing to a progressive shift in how we define masculinity, finally allowing men to be emotional and vulnerable, or to ask for help, or to hug their male friends … or to wear dresses.Ian giggled. “Isn’t it beautiful?” His chest hair battled the sheer neckline. The skirt fanned out as wide as a beach umbrella – a garment fit for a Vegas chapel.I imagined him skiing down Mount St Helens in it, the lengthy rag concealing his chiseled calves and hardened quadriceps, and strained to find it an appealing vision. It was too much – even for him.This was not the first time I’d found myself a little uncomfortable with the sight of Ian in women’s wear. It’s not an unusual sight to spot him sporting a skirt, dress, or sarong at a party, picnic, or trailhead. He uses his unconventional apparel as a display of his iniduality and a reflection of his fondness for fun. I adore both of those qualities, but I was realizing I was less fond of seeing them exhibited through floral numbers or tight sequined garments or wedding dresses.While it was attraction-at-first sight with Ian, his closet full of feminine gear put a tiny dent in his desirability from the very beginning of our relationship. Not enough to stop me from acting on my huge crush, but enough to notice there was an unexpected disconnect between what I thought I was OK with a man wearing, and what I actually found appealing on his body.On the first weekend we hooked up, I had to yank a green sparkly dress over his head to unclothe him. Foreplay involved palming his glittery glutes while dancing to Kesha’s Woman and caressing his furry thigh along a hemline so tight you could almost see the outlines of each and every hair follicle beneath it.“That was the first time I’ve undressed a man – from a dress!” I shrieked the next morning. My palms slapped the concrete countertop as I regaled my housemate Eli with stories from the night before.“Oh girl, what an exciting milestone! Congratulations!” hollered Eli, an effervescent gay man who dons many dresses himself and is supportive of any man excited to do the same.Intellectually, I enjoyed that Ian was rejecting gender norms and expectations. But physically, my desire didn’t match.Those feelings illuminated some unanticipated boundaries of where I define attractiveness in men and when I still crave traditional masculinity. I realized I wanted less dress and more flannel shirts, trucker hats and sandstone Carhartts.When we left the store that day, Ian had a big bundle of wedding dress and I had some big questions to consider.It was skiing that introduced us – we met on the snow-smothered summit of a mountain. He peeled back his Gore-Tex glove to plug my number into his phone, where it still lives under the contact “Emily Let’s Ski!”One of our first dates was skiing on that same mountain. The 75-minute drive to its base was filled with surprisingly open dialogue about relationships, values and family matters. He told me about the companionship he sought through dating, the Tinder dates he endured in hope of finding meaningful connection, and the struggle of forging deep friendships such a great distance away from his family on the east coast.When he asked me how it was to live 3,000 miles away from my family in Vermont, I choked up and revealed how challenging it’d been in the wake of multiple cancer diagnoses that had slammed my immediate family in recent months.“I – I don’t know how to be wholeheartedly supportive from across the country,” I stammered. “I’m missing so much time with my family and it’s so hard to be caring and helpful from so far away.”“I’m so sorry, Emily. I can’t imagine how hard that must be,” Ian’s voice softened and dropped to a compassionate whisper. He pressed his fingers deeper into my fleece jacket.My last relationship had crumbled after my mom’s diagnosis. My ex-boyfriend had the emotional depth of a paper airplane and couldn’t engage with the deep pain I was enduring – or any other emotion, period. When I started hanging out with Ian and he immediately wanted to talk about feelings, it was a gulp of ice-cold lemonade on a 98-degree day. I’d been craving this vulnerability and openness from the men I dated. Conversations like that one in the car drew me to him like a charged magnet, as did hisemotional openness, his fondness for communication, and his public displays of affection for close male friends.My boyfriend’s wedding dress pushed me to perform a scrupulous inventory of my deepest ideas about masculinity and helped me identify my shortfalls as a woman who wants to help rewrite gender norms. As I went through this exercise, I chatted with a handful of girlfriends about it, who could all identify their own small hang-ups with masculinity: their need for men who are bigger and taller than they are, or who are better than them at sports, or who don’t cry in front of them.As we interrogated our feelings about masculinity, we recognized gaps between our ideals and reality.

It was a beautiful day for a wedding dress.On our procession up the mountain, Ian lingered back from our group of friends to check-in with me about my emotional state, aware of the added pain of coping with a sick mother on a holiday dedicated to moms. He wrapped his lace-doused arms around me and pulled me into folds of white fabric.“I’m here if you need anything, babe,” he reminded me.After we reached the summit, Ian plunged down the frozen slope, his long, white train flowing behind him, whipping from side-to-side like a lacy windsock.“Do you find your boyfriend as attractive as I do?” whispered Eli, as we watched Ian plant his poles confidently in front of his flowing skirt, his hairy and silky chest beaming proud against the horizon, his laughing smile nearly detectable through the back of his floral sunhat.My eyes chased my boyfriend down the mountain, my sensitive, silly, affectionate, emotional, vulnerable boyfriend – skiing in his wedding dress.“I do,” I promised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fe2995ae3fb0a82396f7054bb77ddf47ba9e22/0_39_5242_3145/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=850a05b5721d1142c1491b82976fdcf2","title":"julian assange supporters set out stall as extradition hearing begins","story":"US lawyers to give opening arguments for deporting WikiLeaks founder to face charges of espionageJulian Assange is set to face off with the US government when his extradition hearing begins on Monday.A judge at Woolwich crown court in south-east London is due to begin hearing arguments from lawyers for US authorities, who want to try the WikiLeaks founder on espionage charges that carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.After a week of opening arguments, the extradition case is scheduled to be adjourned until May, when the two sides will lay out their evidence. The judge is not expected to rule until several months after that, with the losing side likely to appeal.If the courts approve extradition, the British government will have the final say.Assange, 48, is wanted on 18 charges over the publication of US cables a decade ago. He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents.US authorities say WikiLeaks’ activities put American lives in danger. Assange argues that he was acting as a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and says the leaked documents exposed US military wrongdoing.Journalism organisations and civil liberties groups including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders say the charges set a chilling precedent for freedom of the press.Assange’s father, John Shipton, who visited him in Belmarsh prison on Sunday, claimed his son was “harassed” by a prison cell search ahead of the hearing at the nearby court. Speaking to reporters outside, Shipton demanded Assange be released on bail.“For the life of me I can’t understand why Julian Assange is in jail having committed no crime, with family here that he can come and live with,” he said. “Bail ought to be given immediately if the extradition order isn’t dropped.“Julian had a harassment today. He goes to court tomorrow. They searched his cell this afternoon just before he came down to see us. This plague of malice that emanates from the Crown Prosecution Service to Julian Assange must stop immediately.”Shipton was accompanied on his visit by Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis. They were met by representatives from Reporters Without Borders as they left. Varoufakis said Assange was in a “very dark place” due to spending more than 20 hours a day in solitary confinement.Shipton said it was “distressing” and “very upsetting” to see his son in jail, adding that he had told him his whole family would be supporting him. Last week Shipton warned that his son’s extradition would be akin to a “death sentence”.He addressed hundreds of Assange supporters after they marched through central London to Parliament Square on Saturday to protest against his son’s potential extradition.On Sunday evening, Assange supporters were setting up tents outside the court building."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/387fdbda5a1789904be9b5961e474714138d9497/0_311_3328_1996/master/3328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4392bbc5aa06feb92a646dff30fd00c2","title":"samira ahmed and bbc reach settlement over equal pay claim","story":"Settlement comes after tribunal ruled that Ahmed should have been paid same as fellow presenter Jeremy VineThe BBC has decided not to appeal against the equal pay case involving Newswatch presenter Samira Ahmed after she won an employment tribunal against the broadcaster, giving hope to other women currently seeking back pay from the national broadcaster.Ahmed, the presenter of viewer feedback programme Newswatch, successfully claimed she was owed almost £700,000 in back pay because of the difference between her £440-an-episode rate and the £3,000 an episode Jeremy Vine received for hosting the similar Points of View programme.An employment tribunal unanimously concluded in January that the BBC had failed to provide convincing evidence that the pay gap was for reasons other than gender discrimination.The BBC had argued, among other issues, that Vine deserved a higher pay packet as he was more famous and had a “glint in his eye”, but the tribunal said they did not provide sufficient evidence that this was the case.The BBC initially objected to the ruling but has now declined to appeal against it, reaching an undisclosed financial settlement with Ahmed.The presenter, who was supported by the National Union of Journalists, has not commented on the settlement but after the tribunal verdict she said: “I love working for the BBC. No woman wants to have to take action against their own employer.”In their verdict the tribunal judges said there were only “minor differences” in the work the Ahmed and Vine did presenting the two comparable viewer feedback programmes.They wrote: “Jeremy Vine read the script from the autocue. He read it in the tone in which it was written. If it told him to roll his eyes, he did. It did not require any particular skill or experience to do that.”The decision not to appeal provides hope to the many other women still pursuing the BBC over historic equal pay cases, while the corporation could now face a substantial legal bill as as a result of its decision to fight the case.Equal pay – which covers gender discrimination between iniduals doing the same or equivalent work – is different to the wider societal issue of the gender pay gap.A BBC spokesperson said: “Samira Ahmed and the BBC are pleased to have reached a settlement following the recent tribunal. Samira is a highly valued BBC presenter and now these matters have been concluded we all want to focus on the future. We look forward to continuing to work together to make great programmes for audiences. Neither the BBC, Samira or the NUJ will be commenting further on this case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0932de808b869a1a1119dd8ffd8f38c4513fbe4/0_181_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b5666ea8bc910c8cdc7fbf5d029eb3e","title":"does being married stop me from being a first time buyer","story":"I’ve never owned a property, but we’re living in a house my wife bought several years agoQ My wife and I live in a house my wife bought several years ago before we were married. I have never owned a property. If I were to secure a mortgage solely in my name to buy a new property would I get any stamp duty reduction for being a first-time buyer? The plan would be to sell the house we are currently living in as soon as we’ve moved in to a new property.RKA Contrary to what some solicitors and conveyancers have told other readers asking similar questions to yours, being married does not stop you from being defined as a first-time buyer and so qualifying for stamp duty land tax (SDLT) relief. Provided your spouse doesn’t already own property and you are buying in your name only, you can get relief on the first £300,000 of the purchase price of a property costing up to £500,000 (there’s no relief if it’s more than that).However, being married to someone who does already own property (which he or she is not planning to sell) means that you can’t claim first-time buyer relief. That’s because, according to John Shallcross, an experienced property solicitor and expert in SDLT at law firm, Blake Morgan, “the availability of first-time buyers’ relief would be overridden by the rules for higher-rate SDLT”. Because the SDLT rules treat a married couple as a single entity, you buying a property – even in your own name – would mean that as a married couple, you would end up owning two properties and so be liable for higher-rate SDLT on the purchase of the second. However, provided you sold your wife’s house within three years of moving into yours, you’d be able to claim back the higher-rate surcharge.So your plan to buy your property and then sell your wife’s would totally scupper your chances of being able to claim first-time buyer’s relief and also land you with a bill for the higher rate of SDLT. You can get round this – as so be eligible for first-time buyer relief – by making sure that your wife’s property is sold before, or on the day, that you complete the purchase of your property."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1add1456bda86d7538044e40a13684680b2985aa/0_688_4192_2516/master/4192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf1c6a6da748b641fc40bece878668d7","title":"miles davis bitches brew 50th anniversary film","story":"On the 50th anniversary of Bitches Brew, one of the contributing musicians and the director of a new documentary share their thoughts on the recordGuitarist John McLaughlin, who helped electrify Miles Davis’s music, describes Bitches Brew as “Picasso in sound”. Stanley Nelson, who directed a new documentary on Davis, calls it “an all-out assault”, while Davis’s official biographer, Quincy Troupe, labels it “a cultural breakthrough: it sounded like the future”.Fifty years on, it still does. Next month will mark the 50th anniversary of Bitches Brew, a pivotal album that altered the trajectory of jazz, messed with the boundaries of funk, and pushed psychedelic rock to new heights of exploration. A double set released in March 1970, Bitches greatly advanced a pattern of progression in Davis’s music that snaked back to the start of his recording career in the 1950s. The full arc of Davis’s sound, and life, forms the basis of Birth of the Cool, a two-hour film created for the PBS series American Masters. (The film, which debuts on 25 February in the US, opens in the UK on 13 March and also spawned a new soundtrack on Legacy Records.) It covers everything from Davis’s ravenous creative development, to his ever-evolving fashion sense, to his complex relationship with women. But a key part of the drama centers on what led up to, and followed, the creative Vesuvius that was Bitches Brew.McLaughlin found himself a central figure in that drama immediately after arriving in New York from his home in Europe at the start of 1969. “I was nervous as anything, with sweat running off me,” the guitarist recalled, with a laugh. “I’d only been in New York for 48 hours and I was with my hero!”McLaughlin had come to America to join Lifetime, a new band led by Davis’s drummer, Tony Williams. But before he could even start working with Williams, Davis snagged him, despite the fact that the trumpeter hadn’t heard any of McLaughlin’s solo albums, several of which planted the seeds of what would become the fusion movement. Davis seized on the young McLaughlin purely on the strength of Williams having hired him, as well as on his interest in using an electric guitar on the album he was starting to record, In a Silent Way. It was an album that would become nearly as legendary as Bitches. McLaughlin calls the Silent Way sessions a “baptism by fire”.As soon as they started recording, Davis gave the young player cryptic instructions, such as “play like you don’t know how to play guitar”, McLaughlin recalled. “I just closed the score and started playing: no rhythm, no harmony, just playing the melody and casting my fate to the wind. He loved it.”Silent Way – which also featured key players like Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul – represented Davis’s first all-electric album, following dalliances in that direction the year before on the Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro albums. Though a contemplative and inward work, Silent Way made a deep impression when it came out in July 1969, encouraging Davis to expand his electric forays exponentially with Bitches. McLaughlin’s guitar proved crucial to that expansion. “Miles took me under his wing,” the musician said. “I used to go over to his house on West 77th Street and he always wanted me to bring my guitar. I lost count of how many days I spent there, just hanging out. He would hit a couple of chords on the piano and say: ‘What do you hear? Do you hear a riff? A bass line?’ In England, I had earned my living playing rhythm and blues, funk and R\u0026ampB-jazz. So, Miles picked my brain for anything he could relate to.”“Miles was being influenced by everything around him,” Troupe said. “He was trying to move his music forward.”He was motivated, too, by the changing taste of the public. “1969 was the year jazz seemed to be withering on the vine,” Davis said in his official biography. “We played to a lot of half empty clubs. That told me something. I started realizing that most rock musicians didn’t know anything about music. I figured if they could sell all those records without knowing what they were really doing, I could too – only better.”Just six months separated the sessions between Silent Way and Bitches. The latter took place over three days in August 1969, one week after Woodstock. Still, the two sessions seemed a world apart, given the dense cultural, aesthetic and political changes of the time. “That period was very volatile,” McLaughlin said. “The Vietnam war was happening, the whole black-white thing in America … Things were moving very quickly.”When the musicians entered the studio to record Bitches, “it was clear that Miles wasn’t sure what he wanted”, McLaughlin recalled. “But he knew what he didn’t want. He didn’t want anything like what he had done before. He wanted it more rough and ready. We didn’t really have any scores, maybe just some chords he wrote down on a piece of paper from the bag he brought his coffee in. He’d set a tempo and we’d start. Every time we hit a groove, a really nice beat, he was happy and then he’d start playing. We just moved from one experiment to the next.”Along the way, Davis would throw more inscrutable instructions at the musicians – which again, included Shorter, Zawinul and Corea, along with the bassist Dave Holland. “‘Play the space,’ he told me,” McLaughlin said, with a laugh. “What does that mean? It was like hearing a koan from a zen master.”But it had a positive effect. “It obliged you to think differently,” he said. “You can get into musical habits the same way you get into daily habits. You have to beware of musical indolence. Miles was very much an overseer against musical indolence. He wanted blood and guts and heart all the time.”The subsequent throw-it-at-the-wall approach resulted in sections that went nowhere, with parts that had to be thrown out. Consequently, the final album was a collage, assembled from various segments overseen by Davis and producer Teo Macero. “Miles loved Teo,” said Troupe. “But, in the end, it was his name that was going to be on it: he’s the creator of this.”The musicians themselves were surprised by some of the final recording. “Sometimes in the studio, you don’t see the wood for the trees,” McLaughlin said. “But to hear the album, you hear it all.”And there was a lot to hear. Everything about the music amplified Davis’s earlier approach. He featured more musicians that he had ever used before, often doubling, or tripling, the keyboardists and drummers. “He was opening up from his strict little quartets and quintets,” Troupe said. “He had access to a lot of different musicians and he could plug them in anytime he wanted to. And they were all young, energetic and different.”The goal, Troupe said, was to create “a maelstrom of music. Everything swirling around him, going in different directions at once. And he was at the center, directing everything like a mad scientist.”“It was Miles painting with music,” McLaughlin said, “and we were all his brushes.”The result gave the music a quality at once unsettling and intriguing. In the long tracks – two of which occupy their own side – the musicians forever seem to be coalescing around something, moving towards a target without ever quite arriving. It’s the sound of perpetual discovery, without a final destination. “When you explore, you don’t know what you’re going to run into,” Troupe said. “It’s following your instincts. Music wasn’t a final resting place for Miles. It was a way forward.”At the same time, the music left some of the audience, and certain critics, behind. “There’s a whole group of people who talk about Kind of Blue as the be all and end all,” Nelson said of that 1959, landmark release. “But Bitches Brew was something new. It appealed to a whole new bunch of fans.”It helped that Clive Davis, the head of Miles Davis’s record company, Columbia, secured gigs for the band at the Fillmore East. There, on bills with the likes of Neil Young and the Steve Miller Band, Davis and his band wound up out-freaking the hippie freaks. While the trumpeter had taken inspiration from the energy of rock, the way it came out of his musicians bore no relation to the genre’s cliches. “We were looking for new forms of expression,” McLaughlin said.The name given to the result was fusion, and though some albums that predate Bitches experimented with that approach, Bitches became the movement’s lodestar. The album’s provocative title and cover didn’t hurt. The surreal, Afro-futurist image that graced the gatefold cover, created by the German artist Mati Klarwein, played right into the sensibilities of stoned-out psychedelic rock fans. Inspired by that image, Carlos Santana used a different one by the same artist for his smash album Abraxis. Santana also began to play music inspired by Bitches, as did acts from the Allman Brothers to King Crimson to Soft Machine. At the same time, the key players from Bitches got such a boost from their contributions to the album – which, in McLaughlin’s case, included a track named after him – some formed their own bands, including Mahavishnu Orchestra (led by McLaughlin), Return to Forever (with Corea and Bitches drummer Lenny White) and Weather Report (featuring Shorter and Zawinul). Bitches became Davis’s fastest-selling album, moving 500,000 copies in its first year, and more than 1m units since. It also pointed the way to even harder music by the star, like Music from Jack Johnson, whose sonic violence presaged punk-jazz, and On the Corner, which went deeper into funk and also brought in Indian influences.All of that experimentation was brewed on Bitches. “Ultimately, the album can be looked at in several ways,” said Nelson. “It launched a whole new way of thinking about jazz, and it was very influential with rock musicians. At the same time, it can be taken simply for the great sounds it contains.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81e3e02958e6da319353c3ab036db0b0a26c146d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a88dd4c7e70c374c0501f31769b3dd6","title":"the 100 year life how to prolong a healthy mind","story":"As concerns about dementia grow, more research is investigating how we can keep our brains fit and sharpLiving to 100 will soon become a routine fact of (long) life. Life expectancies have been rising by up to three months a year since 1840 and although gains in the UK began to slow in 2011, it is still estimated that more than half the babies born in wealthier countries since 2000 may reach their 100th birthdays.You do not have to be a newborn to benefit from this trend of increased longevity, though. A 60-year-old in the west today has an even chance of living to 90 and a 40-year-old can expect to live to 95.But the longevity boost is not done yet: it is generally agreed that the natural ceiling to human life is somewhere around 115. Others say that even without cutting-edge AI or other technological wizardry, we could live far longer. Opinion broadly ides into three groups: the “levellers” who say we are at peak life now. The “extrapolators” who argue that technology and education have made their biggest leaps but can squeak us up to a ceiling of 120 before levelling off for good. And the “accelerators” – those determined to defeat ageing, who believe we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in scientific and technological research that will increase longevity, pushing us into the realms of immortality.Life expectancy has been increasing since we cracked infant mortality in the 19th century. Economy, technology, healthcare and education have all combined with vaccines, safer childbirth and medical advances in the care of stroke and heart attack patients to keep the relentless pace of increasing longevity going strong.But the growth in life expectancy began to slow in 2011 in the UK and people live longer in more than two dozen other countries.There has not been a big medical or health gamechanger in the past couple of decades. While some argue that we should celebrate the longest lifes that humans have ever attained, others warn that illness and infirmity risk turning long lives into slow, miserable declines.In his essay on ageing, De Senectute, Cicero says there are four reasons why people write off old age: it stops you working, it makes your body weak, it denies you pleasure and every day is one step closer to death. Then he shows why each argument is wrong. “The old retain their wits quite well,” he notes, “so long as they exercise them”.Dan Buettner coined the term “blue zones” for five regions he identified as having populations who live healthier and longer lives than others (they are Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica, Loma Linda in California and Ikaria in Greece). The diets of those living in these regions, he discovered, consist almost entirely of minimally processed plant-based foods – mostly wholegrains, greens, nuts, tubers and beans. Meat is eaten, on average, five times a month. They drink mostly water, herbal teas, coffee and some wine. They drink little or no cow’s milk.Other scientists have added different ideas to the mix. Sufficient sleep and a sense of purpose are important but exercise is key – at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week, plus twice-weekly muscle-strengthening sessions, to reap health and longevity benefits.At conferences on longevity, it is immediately obvious during the morning breaks that the buffets remain largely untouched – and that everyone drinks their tea and coffee inky black, disdaining even a drop of milk. Most serious seekers of longevity also practice both calorific fasting and intermittent fasting.No one knows quite why intermittent fasting works. The best guess is that it has something to do with metabolic switching and cellular stress resistance causing the body to increase production of antioxidants.Repeated studies on mice going back a century seem to prove that it works – on rodents, at least. Last December, the New England Journal of Medicine reviewed all the studies in this area and concluded that a combination of fasting and calorific reduction does slow ageing, extend life and counteract age-related disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and stroke. “Animal models show that intermittent fasting improves health throughout the life,” the paper concluded.The problem with gauging its efficacy on humans is that, as the paper said: “It remains to be determined whether people can maintain intermittent fasting for years and potentially accrue the benefits seen in animal models.”US scientists are raising funds to launch a five-year clinical trial of a product called metformin, commonly prescribed for pre-diabetics and diabetics. Longevity advocates believe it may have a side effect slowing the development of age-related diseases.“I’m not telling everyone to go out and take it until our clinical trial proves it does what I believe it does,” said Dr Nir Barzilai, the director of the Institute for Ageing at New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine. “But if our trials come back with the results I expect then, yes, I believe everyone should take this drug.”Even more niche are the the promises of Dr Aubrey de Gray, a gerontologist who founded the Sens (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) Research Foundation with the goal of “undoing ageing”.“Sens is defined by a focus on repairing molecular and cellular damage rather than on merely slowing down its accumulation,” he said. The logistics of indefinitely healthy ageing will, he believes, be simple and affordable: “Mostly it’ll be injections once a decade.”The latest epigenetic clock, DNAm PhenoAge, will shortly hit the shelves. Epigenetic clocks – a form of molecular augury – were first developed in 2011 and claim to offer a glimpse into the future. By analysing the pattern of chemical chains that attach to the DNA in your cells, these clocks apparently reveal how swiftly you are ageing – and perhaps even how much longer you will live.The big sell with these tests is that while DNA is fixed at birth, our epigenetic patterns change according to our lifestyles. The promise of those who produce these clocks for commercial use is that they enable us to calibrate our ageing.The tests haven’t been independently evaluated and do not need to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but that has not stopped some life insurance companies using the tests to predict lifes. Researchers have jumped on board, too, using the clocks to test anti-ageing drugs and to look for an anti-ageing diet.Talk of immortality was “outlaw science” until a couple of decades ago but now it is attracting serious interest and big bucks: in 2013, Google invested $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in an entire ision, Calico, which is devoted to “solving death”. The PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to De Grey’s foundation.Instead of focusing on why, say, we get cancer or have a stroke and how to treat each distinct condition, this branch of medical research argues for all these conditions to be regarded as symptoms of one far larger and deadly disease: ageing itself. Instead of trying to treat all these different diseases that develop as people age, the argument goes, we should be trying to treat that one big disease. If we can do that, all the so-called age-related conditions that currently harm so many and cost so much will be – by definition – eradicated.No one is saying it is going to be easy. This branch of research attempts to tackle ageing inside every cell of the body. In other words, change the whole genetic makeup of the human species. There are plenty of claims that we can already slow down the ageing of cells – or senescence – but the most radical adherents claim that the first person to live to 1,000 has already been born.The Miracle of Fasting, Paul and Patricia BraggHow Not to Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease, Michael GregeThe Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who’ve Lived the Longest, Dan BuettnerLife: Why We Age – and Why We Don’t Have To, David SinclairThe Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, Dr Elizabeth Blackburn and Dr Elissa Epel100 Days to a Younger Brain, Dr Sabina Brennan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_57_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754ec7244d9f5063ed8030bd5cf53d6f","title":"manchester city following the money","story":"Manchester City’s fortunes changed dramatically with the takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.

It starts here.And here is his conclusion. He thinks Jonathan Reynolds or Anneliese Dodds, both shadow Treasury ministers, could get the job.Sir Keir Starmer was interviewed this morning by Kay Burley on Sky News, by Mishal Husain on Today and by Nick Ferrari on LBC. Here are the main points from all three interviews.The position the government has just taken is completely wrong - where they are equating the worth of an inidual coming to this country by how much money they earn. I think that’s profoundly the wrong approach ... I think the idea that if you don’t earn a certain salary you’re not bringing anything of any worth to this country is offensive.When asked if that meant he would do away with salary thresholds, he replied:I would - I do not think they are the right measure for the worth of an inidual coming to this country.You’ve got to distinguish between the advocacy of certain things that are right, whether it’s about gay rights, transgender rights, whatever it is - you’ve got to distinguish between that and launching yourself politically into a kind of culture war with the right. If you go, ‘Transgender rights is our big thing’, and the right goes, ‘Immigration control is our big thing’, you’re going to lose that war.Asked about this, Starmer said:I actually think that the way that a potential leader of the Labour party deals with the LGBT community matters hugely, and it is about the values we bring to this. So I disagree with Tony Blair about that.I think this is one of those things that is swirling around. So far the candidates themselves have avoided taking lumps out of each other. I think some of the outriders are trying to stir things up a bit now.I’ve done lots of exciting things. You know, well, with playing football, going to football with my kids. He eventually came up with a story about how, when he got stranded in Newcastle one day during the campaign, on Valentine’s night, he checked into a hotel and went to his room to find someone sleeping in the bed. Asked if it was a man or a woman, Starmer said he did not stay long enough to find out.One of Priti Patel’s Home Office ministerial colleagues has dismissed claims that she is bullying officials, as the home secretary pushed for an inquiry into a series of damaging leaks about her approach in the department, my colleague Peter Walker reports. After the Home Office released a statement denying a rift between Patel and her most senior civil servant, and MI5 rejected reports it is witholding intelligence from her, James Brokenshire called the reports “absolute nonsense”.Today ballot papers start going out in the Labour leadership contest (or, in most cases, emails - people are generally expected to vote electronically) and this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and the clear favourite in the contest, has doing a round of interviews. On the Today programme he was asked if there would be space for Jeremy Corbyn in his shadow cabinet if he won and, although he dodged the question, listeners might have concluded that the answer was no. When Mishal Husain asked Starmer if he would give Corbyn a job, Starmer replied:Look, there’s been so much speculation. I have not discussed that team with anybody. I’m totally focused ...Husain then pressed him again, saying he must have a view on this. But Starmer stuck to the same line.If you can believe it, given that we have been at this for weeks, the ballot is only dropping today, no votes have been cast yet, I’m focused on winning this race and getting as many votes as I possibly can through my argument about unity, effective opposition and focusing on winning the next general election. I have not discussed the shadow cabinet with anybody. And therefore whatever is swirling around, because there are names everywhere, it is all rumour, I can tell you. Although Starmer may not have discussed specific shadow cabinet jobs with anybody, at a Labour hustings yesterday he did say that there would be top jobs for both Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy if he won. Previously he had declined to make that commitment.In truth, most Labour members would probably expect Corbyn to leave the frontbench whoever wins - not least because that is normally what outgoing leaders do (although some do later return to cabinet or shadow cabinet roles, like William Hague). Long-Bailey herself said less than two weeks ago that Corbyn had done his bit and that it was time for a new generation. But she has also said separately that she would offer Corbyn a job because she likes him so much, and the leftwing deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has said the “ideal” outcome would be for Corbyn to stay on as shadow foreign secretary. Last week Corbyn did not rule out taking a shadow cabinet post if offered one.I will post more from the Starmer interviews shortly.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Prof Sir Michael Marmot publishes a report on health inequalities across England.9.30am: David Gauke, the former Tory cabinet minister, speaks at the launch of a Resolution Foundation report on the outlook for next month’s budget. As Richard Partington reports, it says the government is set to increase borrowing to spend more than £1tn a year, increasing the size of the British state to make it bigger than at any point under the 10-year premiership of Labour’s Tony Blair.2.30pm: The Commons starts sitting again after the half-term recess. After housing questions, there are likely to be urgent questions or government statements.After 3pm: Peers start debating the emergency terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill.

Boris Johnson will fail to ‘level up’ the economy if he refuses to abandon austerity and tackle these health inequalities.”Ashworth is also due to challenge Labour about being more ambitious on addressing child poverty. An analysis of the party’s 2019 manifesto by the Resolution Foundation concluded that a focus on spending for older voters meant Labour would not notably reduce levels of child poverty.“We know a child growing up in poverty is more likely to suffer ill health and in turn more likely to develop health problems in later life,” Ashworth will say. “Yet thanks to Tory cuts, child poverty is now projected to rise to the highest level since record began – higher child poverty than even the Thatcher years.“Every child matters and deserves the best possible start but instead this government condemns future generations to becoming ill quicker in life and dying sooner. Challenging these health inequalities and escalating child poverty must be a moral crusade for Labour.”The Marmot review, which was commissioned in 2008 by the then Labour government, uncovered massive “social gradient in health”, meaning that the lower a person’s socioeconomic position, the worse their health was likely to be.Calling the issue “a matter of fairness and social justice”, the report in 2010 concluded that premature deaths from health inequalities was losing an annual total of between 1.3m and 2.5m extra years of life. The economic costs of this, Marmot said, were “staggering”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bed8a29fee79ea77b6326e28139585a908696b4/0_57_3669_2201/master/3669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c6a70433ff499e9c261e7277eeda49","title":"philip morris drew up plan for 1bn tobacco transition fund","story":"Exclusive: firm accused of hypocrisy after talking to anti-tobacco MP about helping smokers switch productsPhilip Morris International (PMI), one of the world’s biggest tobacco companies, drew up plans for a £1bn tobacco transition fund in the UK to be spent by local authorities and Public Health England on persuading smokers to give up cigarettes in favour of alternatives such as its “heat not burn” smokeless tobacco product, IQOS, leaked documents reveal.The documents, obtained by the  and Channel 4’s Dispatches programme, show PMI had discussions with a leading anti-tobacco MP about presenting a smoke-free bill proposing the fund to the House of Commons. If passed, the bill would have ended an advertising and marketing ban on IQOS and e-cigarettes.PMI wants to be seen as part of the solution to smoking, which kills half of all people who take it up, even though the company continues to make and market cigarettes around the world. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said this approach was “breathtakingly hypocritical”.PMI has declared it is committed to working for a “smoke-free future” in which products such as IQOS, which heats tobacco to deliver nicotine without the smoke and tar that cause diseases including cancer, replace cigarettes. When the Food and Drug Administration in the United States licensed IQOS there, it said the high nicotine hit it delivered could make it an attractive alternative to cigarettes for smokers, but there was a risk of creating addiction in non-smokers.Ash has advocated a “polluter pays” fund for smoking cessation services, but not one that transitions people on to other addictive tobacco products. Arnott said PMI was seeking to buy respectability, access to government and a role in smoking policy that the industry at the moment is categorically denied.“This is completely unacceptable,” said Arnott. “The tobacco industry is the most profitable consumer business on the planet, selling products which kill 7 million people a year globally and nearly 100,000 in the UK alone. The industry can afford to pay and it should be made to pay, not allowed a seat at the government policymaking table so it can ensure the fund is used to further the interests of its shareholders rather than public health.”The MP who met PMI was Labour’s Kevin Barron, now retired, who has an exemplary record in combating smoking and is credited with getting the bill that banned smoking in public places through parliament. Barron said he believed e-cigarettes and other nicotine-delivery devices that were less harmful than cigarettes had an important part to play and he had no qualms in meeting companies that wanted to go in that direction.The internal documents – an email and two briefing papers – are dated March and May 2018. An email from Mark MacGregor, PMI’s corporate affairs director and a former chief executive of the Conservative party, said an exploratory conversation with the MP had been extremely positive. “He understands the concept of the ‘deal’ that is on offer and is very attracted to the incentive that the fund could provide to change behaviours among smokers and the industry – though balanced by enabling industry to inform smokers,” it said.That would have meant the removal of advertising restrictions. PMI proposed the setting up of a £1bn fund over 10 years from 2021 in exchange for the loosening of laws curbing advertising of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products. The money was to come from all the major tobacco companies with products on the market in the UK.The documents show that the bill, if passed, would have rewritten the rules on e-cigarettes after the UK’s exit from the EU. A European directive dictates the size and strength of nicotine liquids in e-cigarettes, which has, for instance, resulted in Juul devices popular with young people containing only 20mg of nicotine instead of 59mg in the USA, so that they are less addictive. That restriction would go, as would limits on packaging and advertising. The relevant parts of the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016, which enshrined the EU rules in UK law, would be repealed, “enabling adult smokers to make informed decisions”, the document says.PMI envisaged that IQOS would be redefined as a “considerably less harmful novel smokeless tobacco product” (CLHTP). Such products would have lighter regulation and would be promoted to people who cannot stop smoking and do not switch to e-cigarettes, says the document. “Publicly funded public health communications and anti-smoking campaigns, as well as professional health advice such as Nice guidance, must include advice on e-cigarettes and CLHTPs,” says PMI’s draft bill.The money from the fund would mostly go to local authorities, which are responsible for smoking cessation programmes. Public Health England would get £15m “to facilitate switching” from cigarettes to IQOS, and would have to “report annually on its efforts and achievements in improving the scientific knowledge base and consumer understanding of non-combustible alternatives”.He said companies must not be able to stipulate that their specific products must be used. “You cannot buy the market, although they have money,” he said. “But if they want to promote a safer, less harmful product for somebody who is addicted to nicotine, my view is we should help them to do that because it will lessen the deaths from combustible tobacco. So I did the 10-minute-rule bill. I spoke to ministers and said this was what it was about. I don’t think the discussions were completely hostile.”The bill, competing with 149 others, was not adopted. Ash worries that in the post-Brexit world, the EU’s tight regulations over e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products could be lifted with the sort of consequences that occurred in the US when Juul took off among teens.Arnott said: “Ash has worked with Kevin Barron for decades. He led the campaign in parliament to ban tobacco advertising and it’s thanks to his work that pubs are now smoke-free. If, as it looks like, PMI persuaded Kevin Barron of the need for government to partner with the industry, their ‘normalisation’ strategy is clearly working. “Kevin may have left parliament, but PMI’s parliamentary and public relations campaign continues. Now the government has committed to considering the ‘polluter pays’ approach, PMI will be lobbying to ensure it’s structured to suit their commercial interests.”Philip Morris said it supported the government’s commitment to make England smoke-free by 2030. “To realise this ambition, millions of current smokers need to be persuaded to quit altogether or switch to less harmful alternatives. Critical to this will be putting in place a regulatory framework that ensures smokers have the facts about alternatives and that tobacco companies are pushed to phase out cigarettes.“We have made this point time and time again to MPs, civil servants, local councillors, journalists and the broader public. What this story really shows is that Philip Morris has been consistent in its efforts to make smoke-free 2030 a reality.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5d7ed510064ee2000ddf668dd1252f87b3ef000/0_72_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ee4269a11207cb74f6a8af167739ac","title":"patrick reed holds nerve to secure victory in mexico","story":"This rapidly developed into the World Golf Championship of the damned. For so much of Sunday, the devil could have cast his net over the leaders of the WGC-Mexico Championship. Three and four way ties as further players lay within touching distance pointed towards a gripping denouement.Ultimately it came down to Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed, two golfers seeking to switch unfortunate narratives as attached to them. DeChambeau, widely castigated for slow play and - in this very tournament - using his putter as a mallet on a green, ultimately threw away the chance of the biggest win of his career. Reed, who has been berated for his actions as drew a penalty in the Hero World Challenge in December, overhauled the Californian. When it counted, Reed let his golf do the talking yet again.Reed’s ability to ignore external noise - and, as coming from Brooks Koepka in recent days, there was rather a lot of it - really is quite something.He has been publicly questioned by his peers and responded brilliantly.This victory all-but secures Reed’s return to the Ryder Cup - alongside Koepka, one assumes - at Whistling Straits in September. Reed took a two-stroke lead onto the 18th tee after three birdies in a row, with his subsequent victory by one. Reed signed for a Sunday 67, meaning an 18 under par total.DeChambeau’s 65 was hardly moderate but with the trophy in his sights, he stumbled. This marks Reed’s second World Golf Championship which, coupled with the donning of a Green Jacket in 2018, triggers memories of the Texan once proclaiming himself a top five player in the world. Who’s laughing now? DeChambeau had separated himself from the field with birdies at the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th. Yet Reed refused to go away the former Masters champion collected shots at the 12th and 15th. Crucially, Reed hadn’t dropped a single shot all day as DeChambeau did precisely that with a three-putt at the 17th. Almost immediately, Reed hit an approach shot to tap-in range on 16, meaning he held a one-stroke lead with two to play.Reed’s birdie at the penultimate hole rendered his bogey on 18 irrelevant.To DeChambeau’s credit, he headed to the final green to congratulate the champion.“My team and I, we’ve worked so hard through the end of last year and also at the beginning of this year,” Reed said. “It kept on feeling like I was playing some good golf, just we weren’t quite able to get over that hump.” Rory McIlroy had been within one of the lead until DeChambeau pressed upon his accelerator and the world No1 three-putted the 12th. From there, McIlroy was playing for the top five. His 68 meant fifth place at 14 under.McIlroy will be disappointed at not being in position to pressurise DeChambeau over the closing stretch but, in truth, this was a decent tournament finish from the Northern Irishman after three days of playing with his B-game. “I’m looking forward to a week off,” McIlroy said. “It’s frustrating, I didn’t feel like I got the best out of myself.” Whilst McIlroy essentially held things together, Justin Thomas imploded. In what represented a curious scenario for a player who is typically formidable from the front, the 54-hole leader slipped to a 73. Thomas encountered problems from the tee all day, with a four over par run between the 7th tee and 10th green epitomising his struggles. Thomas tied sixth with Tyrrell Hatton, with the Englishman due immense credit for this performance in his first start of 2020. Hatton has been suffering from a wrist injury.Jon Rahm could have toppled McIlroy at the summit of the world rankings with a win and was amongst those tied at the top early on day four. Rahm’s 67 meant a 15 under par total, a tie for third with Erik Van Rooyen and that McIlroy’s position is safe for another week at least.As Reed was sealing victory, Viktor Hovland did likewise in Puerto Rico. A first PGA Tour success for the 22-year-old from Oslo - well known as an exceptional talent - will only fuel theories about Ryder Cup participation later this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2bae0973a5fb485b41d82f0f2c5abc6e30851a5/0_237_3632_2181/master/3632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32718aad638824c5618fb939f0aec548","title":"women s t20 world cup australia sri lanka report","story":"Australia got out of jail thanks to an inspired innings from Rachael Haynes after a top order collapse in Perth threatened to derail the host nation’s hopes at the Women’s Twenty20 World Cup.Having been set 123 for victory at the Waca Ground, the hosts fell to 10-3 in the fourth over as Alyssa Healy, Beth Mooney and Ash Gardner all fell cheaply.With a huge upset on the cards – and their continued participation in the tournament in doubt – Haynes, aided and abetted by Meg Lanning, came to the rescue with a crucial knock of 60.

We tour the ancient city, and nearby Vermillion Coast, that inspired themWe’re on a train to the centre of the universe. It sounds like something from Doctor Who, or maybe Hitchhiker’s Guide, but in fact it’s a ride of less than seven hours from Paris.In 1963, Salvador Dalí was travelling through Perpignan when he had a vision – a véritable éjaculation mentale – of the city’s station as the cosmic centre of the universe, with the building’s proportions reflecting its structure perfectly. Whether paranoia or substance abuse lay behind this vision we’ll never know, but he encapsulated it in a surreal 1965 painting (La Gare de Perpignan, now in Cologne’s Museum Ludwig).Dalí also declared that sooner or later everyone changes trains at Perpignan: the city is on the route from Barcelona and Girona in Spain to all points French. But those who just use Perpignan as a way-station are missing out on a small (120,000 inhabitants), ancient, walkable city with a Catalan feel and a delightful climate – the Pyrenees to the west offer shelter from wind and rain. It’s also a place where wine and rugby are the twin obsessions, with tourism a distant third.It may be the centre of the universe but Perpignan station isn’t in the centre of Perpignan. We walk into town along the green banks of the Basse River, arriving 20 minutes later at Quai Vauban, the city’s answer to Las Ramblas, with cafes and tree-lined walkways – but no crowds or selfie sticks. To our left, early-20th-century boulevards are lined with elegant buildings to our right lies the tangled medieval city – narrow streets laid out 800 years ago, low-rise and ungentrified.The coast to the south is called the Vermillion Coast thanks to the iron ore in the rock and there’s lots that is red about Perpignan, too: wrought-iron balconies on old mansions have a rust-coloured patina, pavements are in red marble and the city’s emblem, the 14th-century Castillet fort, now used for art exhibitions and Bastille Day fireworks, is in early red brick. There’s pink stone on the even older John the Baptist Cathedral nearby, whose huge Campo Santo burial ground is used for concerts and a summer festival.Secular buildings are just as fascinating. Also rosy-hued, Casa Xanxo (rue de la Main de Fer, free) was built in 1506 by a wealthy cloth merchant who felt the need for a richly carved frieze of the seven deadly sins on the facade. More than 300 years later, another family felt no guilt about growing rich on the manufacture of Job cigarette papers and built the elegant Hôtel Pams (free), furnishing it with gold, marble, onyx and huge murals by artist Paul Gervais.For me, the best thing about this corner of the Med is its importance in 20th-century art. From 1905, Matisse and Derain found inspiration on the coast, and before Dalí had his epiphany here, another Spanish genius, Picasso, was a regular visitor. He was great friends with the local de Lazerme family, whose former home has just been incorporated into Perpignan’s major gallery, Musée Rigaud (from €8, under-18s free). Its collection goes back to gothic and baroque periods, but I prefer quiet, expressive sculptures by local Aristide Maillol (1861-1944) and a tender 1954 painting of Mme Paule de Lazerme in Catalan dress by Picasso.Paule, last of the de Lazermes, declared on her 80th birthday that she would bequeath the family home to the city. It had a long wait: she lived on for another 22 years, dying in 2012 at the age of 102. The extended gallery reopened in 2017.Scantily clad women in the Hôtel Pams’ murals are cavorting against a backdrop of red and orange cliffs above cobalt water – the Vermillion Coast, 20 minutes away by train and our next destination. Much of the western Med is flat and pretty featureless – though with great beaches – but this changes south of Perpignan, where the Pyrenees meet the sea in a jumble of cliffs, hilltop forts with views and an indented coastline hiding cute coves and sandy bays.Collioure, on a natural harbour with four beaches, looks like one big painting. Locals are forbidden from using black or white paint on their houses, so the town is a kaleidoscope of colour schemes – gold with bright green woodwork, cream and royal blue, pink and pale green – against blue sea and vine-covered hills. It was originally an anchovy port. The little fishes are still all processed by hand, and celebrated at an anchovy festival held the first weekend in June.When Matisse came in 1905, he was depressed, broke and desperate to find his own style. The bright colours of Collioure lifted his spirits and inspired his art and that of his friend André Derain, who travelled south to join him. The pair made many paintings here, and though they didn’t find favour with critics, who likened them to the work of wild beasts (fauves), an art movement was born.Everyone in town seems to be an artist or collector: a hilly area behind the port called Le Petit Montmartre, bright with oleanders, hibiscus and bougainvillea, has sculptures on doorsteps and paintings on walls. A group of children are on their own tour, creating fauve works with palettes and brushes (collioure, English guide available, 4-12s, one hour €3).Less artistic kids might like the fact that Collioure is home to France’s commando training centre (CNEC): scarily fit, black-clad ninja types can be spotted doing daring feats on the water, rock faces and castle walls.We climb to 16th-century Fort Saint-Elme to admire views of Collioure and Port-Vendres further south, and take a boat trip down the coast as far as the Spanish border. But there’s more to see and do – not least the sandy beaches of l’Ouille and le Racou, both walkable from Collioure. Dalí said Perpignan station was where his most ingenious ideas came to him but I don’t need to be a surrealist visionary to see that another trip to this corner of France is a brilliant notion. • The trip was provided by Perpignan and Collioure tourist boards (perpignanfr, visitcollioure)Avoid menu anxiety at Le Dix-Sept (two courses €18, three courses €24), which does a set lunch of exquisitely presented dishes at tables in the courtyard outside Perpignan’s 10th-century Saint Jean le Vieux church.The menu at Le Figuier, on the edge of Perpignan old town, offers a choice of traditional or innovative at each course: starters of, say, Catalan paté and pickles, or goat’s cheese panna cotta with oregano oil and pine nuts, plus local Cap d’Ona beers (two courses €15).Plug into France’s Slow Food movement at Collioure’s La Cuisine Comptoir, run by Cumbrian-born Victoria Robinson, who has lived here for 20 years. She buys all her ingredients from small producers – meat only from “people who knew the animal from birth”, fish from “petits métiers” (one-person businesses) and goat’s cheese from unfenced herds. Among lots of vegan and vegetarian choices, standouts were beetroot gazpacho with tahini, and new potatoes with aioli (small plates from €7).For a treat, Le Neptune, on a cliff overlooking Collioure’s harbour, has tables on two stacked terraces – one with a 300-year-old fig tree – with panoramic views, and a fish-heavy menu. One favourite is sea bass with artichokes, mushroom cream and chorizo crumbs (four courses €39).Try the elegant reds and floral whites of this area at Olivier Pithon’s biodynamic winery near Calce. Pithon happens to be a fan of Cleese, Palin, Idle and co, and names a delicious sunny red (best served slightly chilled) and a minerally-citrussy blended white after his almost namesake – Mon P’tit Pithon.Collioure’s wine cooperative is in a 13th-century former Dominican monastery (tour and tasting €3pp), making red, white and rosé with grapes from 160 growers. The most famous is Banyuls sweet wine, aged in demijohns in the cellar or out in the sun. It has a golden raisin flavour, citrussy when young but more honeyed when older – perfect with goat’s cheese.Around a tranquil courtyard in Collioure’s lively centre, Hôtel Casa Païral (doubles from €84 room only) offers views of terracotta rooftops, umbrella pines and seagulls. Breakfast in the courtyard (with cheese, meats, eggs and lots of local fresh fruit) is particularly enjoyable.Family-run campsite La Girelle (tent and two people from €18.50, four-person chalet from €49) has direct access to L’Ouille beach and is 20 minutes’ walk from Collioure, with a small shop, restaurant and bar on site.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

This was evidenced by nearly a million fewer people tuning in compared to its 2019 launch episode. Caroline Flack’s death earlier this month then cast a long, dark shadow over the show’s final stages. Flack, the former presenter, was the fourth person associated with the show to have taken their own life in the past two years, after Sophie Gradon and her boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, in 2018 and Mike Thalassitis last year.Flack’s charm, and one of the show’s highlights, lay in giving off the impression she could have been an Islander herself. On Christmas Eve she wrote of the “scrutiny and speculation” she had faced after being charged with assault following an incident with her boyfriend. Much of the scrutiny took place in the tabloid press and on social media, a key component of the Love Island experience – the running commentary under the LoveIsland hashtag is another feature associated with the programme.When the show returned after a two-day hiatus following Flack’s suicide, retweeting memes and gags felt borderline disrespectful and even dangerous, given the nature of her passing. In an attempt to make it less so, JustEat sponsorship ads were swapped out with ones for mental health charity Mind.For a show that usually goes as deep as a dip in the villa pool, it weighed heavy. These issues are not Love Island-specific, but rather a symptom of wider issues regarding social media trolling and the quality of reality TV aftercare. But the show’s reliance on hashtags and Islanders to accrue as large an Instagram following as possible makes it particularly susceptible to online abuses.Moral arguments aside, Love Island has gone from being good-bad TV to bad-bad TV. Though the incentives for appearing on it have changed, its format has barely evolved. The near identical conveyor belt of Chrises and Jesses and Jacks have long been a running joke online, as producers certainly have a “type on paper”. “Twists” such as double dumpings and Casa Amor are as hackneyed as the obligatory end-of-series pool jump. In the show’s five-year history, not a single Islander has ever chosen to steal the money from their partner at the finale when given the option.By its end, when Finley Tapp and Paige Turley were crowned series winners, the hour-long episodes airing six nights a week had begun to feel like a test of endurance. Yet few lessons appear to have been learned. The 2020 summer series has already been confirmed. On Sunday, the most read article on the Mirror’s website involved contestant Shaughna Phillips looking “unrecognisable” after leaving the villa. In the same top five were two about Flack’s suicide. The show lost its magic long ago – now it has lost its chance to end on a high."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d80d3046ca85d15f7f572df24b7455637f615da/713_267_3109_1866/master/3109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=220186305ddd9b64b0fdcd17e6b40e87","title":"world is approaching coronavirus tipping point experts say","story":"78,000 cases confirmed, as Italy and Iran scramble to contain major outbreaksThe world is fast approaching a tipping point in the spread of the coronavirus, according to experts, who warn that the disease is outpacing efforts to contain it, after major outbreaks forced Italy and Iran to introduce stringent internal travel restrictions and South Korea’s president placed the country on red alert.Some of the countries most affected by the virus are scrambling to halt its progress two days after Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said the international community needed to act quickly before the narrowing “window of opportunity” closed completely.With almost 78,000 cases of Covid-19 now confirmed across the globe, experts say the situation will soon reach a critical threshold.In 11 north Italian towns, 50,000 people have been in lockdown since Friday night, with police patrolling the streets and fines imposed on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. In Iran, the authorities have ordered the closure of schools, universities and other educational centres in 14 provinces as “a preventative measure”.On Sunday, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, placed the country on “red alert” after it reported its sixth death and more than600 infections. And four of the 32 British and Irish Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers flown to the UK on Saturday have tested positive for Covid-19, the Chief Medical Officer for England said on Sunday. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13.While the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no obvious link to China, leaving experts struggling to determine where they started.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and an authority on the new coronavirus infection, echoed Tedros’s warning and said the time for containing the disease was running out.“The director general of the WHO has recently spoken of a narrowing of the window of opportunity to control the current epidemic,” he said. “The tipping point after which our ability to prevent a global pandemic ends seems a lot closer after the past 24 hours.”Hunter said that while cases were declining in China, where the outbreak began, the weekend had seen some “extremely concerning developments elsewhere”.He said the surge in South Korean cases had been unprecedented so far in the epidemic, adding: “The identification of the large cluster of cases in Italy is a big worry for Europe and we can expect there to be quite a few more cases identified in the next few days.”Hunter also said the situation in Iran could have major implications for the Middle East. “A further problem with the Iranian cases is wider armed conflicts in the region,” he said.Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, pointed out that case numbers in Italy had doubled between Friday and Saturday. “This is an important stage of the coronavirus outbreak,” he said. “Fast isolation of even mild cases in affected areas is important for preventing substantial person-to-person transmission in Europe. It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.”Two people have died from the virus in Italy since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 40 miles south-east of Milan.Those living in the affected areas now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival were cancelled and Milan fashion week was also affected.Iran has recorded eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases, bringing the overall number of infections to 43. Four new infections surfaced in the capital, Tehran, seven in the city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, the health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said.Pakistan responded by closing its land border with Iran, while Afghanistan said it was suspending travel to Iran “to prevent the spread of the novel \u001dcoronavirus and protect the public”. Turkey also closed its borders and said it would halt incoming flights, adding that all motorways and railways at the border would be shut on Sunday afternoon.Jordan, meanwhile, will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly outbreak.Announcing his decision to raise South Korea’s alert level on Sunday, Moon said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take “unprecedented, powerful” measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by “regulations”.As his country struggled to contain theoutbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as “a very important moment”, the news agency Yonhap said. Of the 123 new cases, 75 were related to the Shincheonji church in Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city, and a neighbouring hospital.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers had been screened for the virus.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. It is also warning that travellers from Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand who develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath within 14 days of returning the UK should contact the NHS by phone.The raising of the alert level came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country’s management of the outbreak.Warning that China’s virus epidemic was “still grim and complex,” the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called on Sunday for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting the spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist party’s response as “timely and effective” in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the Xinhua news agency.“The current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,” Xinhua cited Xi as saying. “Prevention and control are at the most critical stage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99aaf9c56b40a068b0c49920291176d9460bd54e/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d83b42c86cca28fdb36d1589ab247a3","title":"british tourists stranded in canary islands after saharan sandstorm blows in","story":"Dozens of flights cancelled due to poor visibility, leaving holidaymakers stuck at airportsHolidaymakers have been stranded at airports in the Canary Islands after a Saharan sandstorm left the destination coated with dust, reducing visibility for aircraft.Flights from Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, North and South Tenerife airports were grounded due to the weather conditions, although customer service staff said the airports remained open for passengers.Passengers were advised to contact their airline and try to get accommodation for the night if their flight was cancelled.On Monday morning, airport operator Aena said flights from four of the airports – Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma and North Tenerife – would be able to take off. Those departing South Tenerife continue to be grounded, the statement added.Passengers have posted photographs of people sitting on the floor waiting for more information.Greg Horsman, 29, was on holiday with his girlfriend and his friends on a Tui cruise and was due to fly home to Manchester on Saturday evening.However, they have been forced to stay in Gran Canaria for another two nights due to the storm.“It’s frustrating. We’re just ready to be home,” he said.“There should be contingency plans for when a weather event grounds flights. They all kept saying ‘Oh we’ve never seen this happen before’ which I understand, it’s a freak of nature, but when weather grounds all flights there is surely a contingency plan that gets put into place so people can get accommodation sorted.”Graham Whiteman, 30, arrived at Las Palmas airport at 5pm on Saturday night, but discovered his Tui flight back to Doncaster – which he was due to be on with his fiancee and her family – had been cancelled.He said: “We were told we needed to check the boards for updates.“We didn’t get any and then at 1.30am we found a Tui rep, who then sorted us out with a hotel room on the other side of the island at 4am.“We got an email at 7.58am saying a coach would be leaving the hotel at 8.30am to take us to the airport and we’ve been here ever since.”He added: “I am type one diabetic and when I explained to a Tui rep that I will not have enough insulin for the next 24 hours, their response was that they would deal with it when it becomes an emergency.“The duty of care for their customers is a disgrace, they do not want to take responsibility for anything or anyone. Children and elderly adults having no option but to sit and sleep on the dirty airport floors.”A spokeswoman for Tui said: “We would like to sincerely apologise to customers for the disruption caused by the adverse and changeable weather conditions. The safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority and we are working tirelessly to find the best solutions for all our customers.”Elsewhere, Britons have posted photographs of the orange sky on the islands as the wind continued to batter seaside towns.Michael Nixon, who is on holiday in Tenerife with his family to celebrate his 50th birthday and is due to fly home to Newcastle on Wednesday, said “pink dust” had covered his rented apartment balcony.He said: “It’s all a bit surreal. A heavy mist came in last night followed by very strong gusty winds during the night. This morning we awoke to yellowish haze and strong winds. “We ventured out but it’s difficult to see with all of the sand in the air. We are slightly concerned that our flight home on Wednesday could be affected.”Meanwhile in the UK, flights out to the Canary Islands are being delayed or cancelled due to the sandstorm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84fc3393800c51e4f636185ca3657ad356eb34b/0_27_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fffd3594add95aa2bbfdd9048841418","title":"german centre left victorious hamburg state elections spd","story":"SPD bucks national trend, while support for Merkel’s CDU drops to historic lowGermany’s centre-left parties consolidated their governing majority in state elections in the northern city of Hamburg on Sunday, while support for Angela Merkel’s conservatives dropped to a historic low and the far right crossed the threshold for entering parliament only by the narrowest of margins.The CDU will hold an extraordinary party congress on either 25 April or 9 May to elect a new chair and gain clarity over who will lead the conservatives into the next federal elections, scheduled for 2021.Because of Hamburg’s complicated election rules, a final result is not expected to be confirmed until Tuesday.Local factors are likely to have played a bigger role than national events at the voting booth in Germany’s second largest city, one of the wealthiest regions in Europe. Hamburg’s SPD is seen as more centrist and business-friendly than the leftwing leadership at federal level, and the mayor, Peter Tschentscher, had a strong record on building new housing, expanding free day-care and increasing the number of all-day schools to boost his case.Both the SPD and the Greens can claim to have put into practice the outcome of a 2013 referendum in favour of bringing  the city’s utilities grids back into public hands with considerable success.But as the only state elections scheduled in Germany this year, the outcome of the vote nonetheless has symbolic power.Coming just days after a racist gunman murdered 10 people in the western city of Hanau and weeks after a scandal over centre-right parties voting with the AfD in the eastern state of Thuringia, the Hamburg vote shows that the far right’s aggressively nationalistic posturing and xenophobic rhetoric does not necessarily have to set the political agenda.While the total number of votes for the AfD remained relatively stable, the party’s share was pushed down by an increased turnout in support of the centre-left, possibly in protest against the racially motivated attack in Hanau.For a CDU trying to establish whether the way out of Merkel’s shadow involves sticking to her centrist course or tacking right, its poor showing among urbane voters will offer food for thought.Paul Ziemiak, the general secretary of Merkel’s party, described the result as “historically poor”, adding that his party’s confused course in Thuringia had not helped its case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a222b38392aaae27e77664b9ce8d8636d59b466/0_207_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47f6483c5a2778f297732807be3e14ad","title":"how have your travel plans been affected by the coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from those who have cancelled or rearranged travel plans due to the outbreakItaly and Iran have been forced to introduce travel restrictions due to major outbreaks in both countries.

In another possible sign of improving conditions, Chinese media said that six cities in Hubei province, including Huanggang and Jingzhou, reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, while 24 out of 31 other Chinese provinces also recorded no rise. However, the situation appeared to be deteriorating in other parts of the world as South Korea reported another 161 cases overnight.

The source said Sunday Times reports at the weekend were “simply untrue” and that she was getting the same information from the agency as any other home secretary. It comes in the wake of a series of stories claiming that Patel has had difficult relationships with officials during her ministerial career. Her allies believe she is being targeted because officials do not like being challenged.Malaysia drama – Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has resigned on a day of political drama. Mahathir, who is 94, took office in May 2018 when he defeated Najib Razak. Would-be leader Anwar Ibrahim earlier accused Mahathir of plotting to bring down the ruling coalition.Labour vote – As Labour party members begin receiving ballot papers for the leadership election today, the frontrunner, Sir Keir Starmer, has pledged to give leading shadow cabinet posts to his rivals Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Speaking at a hustings event in Durham, Starmer said they were both excellent candidates and suggested that all three represented the future of the party. “Whichever one of us actually wins this, what you are seeing on display here is the leadership of the Labour party,” he said. Most members will be able to vote via email, but paper ballots will be available as well. The vote closes on 2 April with the result to be announced two days later.Bin death warning – At least seven people are known to have died in the last five years as a result of sleeping in bins and being crushed when the rubbish is emptied, the waste industry says, as it highlights a deadly consequence of Britain’s growing homelessness problem. Bosses also say there were 109 near misses between April and December last year as destitute people increasingly seek shelter in large, enclosed rubbish containers.Diabetes risk – A growing obesity crisis means a record number of people are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and with it an increased chance of a heart attack or stroke. To tackle the problem, the NHS is going to make a radical new liquid diet available to patients which will put type 2 diabetes into remission. A pilot scheme will see 5,000 patients restricted to 800 calories per day for three months. They will then have another nine months of support to help them maintain weight loss.Caught in a storm – Hundreds of British holidaymakers stranded in the Canary Islands after a sandstorm may be able to return home today after airports reopened.

It states that “prayer cards” for those taking part in services can secure seats.The report also calls for the introduction of “humanist pastoral carers” who can meet the pastoral needs of the growing number of parliamentarians who are humanists, atheists or agnostics at Westminster. It stresses that in other places, such as hospitals and prisons, non-religious humanist pastoral care services are provided.On their recommendation about Church of England bishops, the report cites nine cases where senior Anglican clerics used their guaranteed seats in the House of Lords to change the outcome of votes.These include two that directly benefited the C of E, the report says. In the first bishops’ votes helped remove a clause in the Equality Act 2010, which enabled the C of E to have wider exemptions in its employment practices.The other vote on the Education and Adoption Act 2016 ensured that C of E maintained schools that are failing can be forcibly converted to academies, which the report says gave the church more control over its schools.The report criticises the unique speaking rights afforded to Anglican bishops and access to officials who are charged with writing new laws.On the issue of prayers before crucial Commons votes, one MP in the report said: “I stand outside the House of Commons chamber at the start of the session, peering through the window as colleagues take part in prayers. Whilst I appreciate it means a lot to them, the rituals make me feel excluded. I’m unable to take part in the start of the parliamentary day unless I lie and profess to believe in something I do not.”The report recommends replacing prayers with a daily “time for reflection” similar to that held in the Scottish parliament, which would be “inclusive of the broad range of religious and non-religious worldviews in today’s UK”.Conservative MP Crispin Blunt who chairs the APPHG said: “The UK is more erse than ever before and yet our parliament remains an institution that marginalises those who are not Anglican. This report highlights the dated nature of our system where non-Anglican MPs and peers like me can be put at a disadvantage because they don’t wish to attend prayers.“It is now time for us to consider how prayers as part of our procedures could be replaced, perhaps with an inclusive time for reflection, ensuring all parliamentarians get the same rights so that everyone can take part in the day’s business without having to compromise values important to them.”The parliamentary group is backed by UK Humanists. Its chief executive, Andrew Copson, said the end of guaranteed seats for bishops, secular alternatives to prayers for non-believers and humanist pastoral care in parliament was part of the equality agenda at Westminster.“When you have been privileged for so long, equality can seem like a step down, but I hope that Anglicans, in particular, will be able to see that the authors of this report are aiming for a broad and inclusive approach. This report shows the way forward to a parliament that treats its members equally, regardless of religion or belief and – just as importantly – is more reflective of the erse public it serves,” Copson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a5b2ae1206ff5650e700915aa2c89787ca25b1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d780cdf08d619549737cb34e0680c2","title":"canary islands sandstorm leaves tourists stranded in pictures","story":"A sandstorm forced the closure of airports on Spain’s Canary Islands at the weekend.

Or head up into the mountains of Alsace where you’ll find German influences in the pretty timber-framed villages and local beer.Start this trip by catching P\u0026ampO Ferries’ Dover to Calais ferry it takes an hour and a half and there are up to 23 crossings a day to choose from.Take four days of holiday before and after Easter weekend (10-13 April) to get 16 days off, including weekends.Embrace the spring bank holiday … and see a different side of the NetherlandsThis year, the early May bank holiday has been moved to a Friday (8 May) to commemorate VE Day and 75 years since the end of the second world war. Take off the four days before and you’ll get a lovely nine-day uninterrupted stretch.Explore an overlooked European city by heading to Rotterdam. P\u0026ampO Ferries runs a daily, 12-hour overnight crossing from Hull that gets you into the Dutch city the next morning. Rotterdam had to be almost completely rebuilt after the second world war and has subsequently reinvented itself as a destination bristling with creativity and innovation. You could spend weeks here checking out the hip places to sip coffee and the alternative sights, such as the world’s first floating farm that opened in Merwehaven last summer. Also look out for free events across the city to coincide with Liberation Day on 5 May, which is a national holiday in the Netherlands. For extra points, extend your break into the following week when Rotterdam will be getting ready to host this year’s Eurovision song contest.Take four days of holiday before the early May bank holiday (8 May) to get nine days off in a row, including weekends.Roll those May bank holidays together … and take a summer road trip through IrelandGot some annual leave that needs using up? (Apparently those people do exist!) Then take 10 days between the two May bank holidays and you’ll get a sweet 18 days off in a row. That’s an excellent amount of time to do justice to a road trip around Ireland. P\u0026ampO Ferries’ Cairnryan to Larne route takes you from south-west Scotland to Northern Ireland in a speedy two hours. There are up to seven crossings a day, so you’ll have heaps of flexibility about when you travel.Arriving at Larne, which is just 20 miles from Belfast, you’re well placed to check out the new Game of Thrones tour at Linen Mill Studios (opening in spring). And don’t forget to include Galway in your itinerary – the west coast town is the European capital of culture for 2020. Events in May include a new artwork from David Best, who’s known for his blazing installations at Burning Man.Take 10 days of holiday between the two May bank holidays (8 and 25 May) to get a continuous 18 days off, including weekends.Make the most of the final long weekend of the summer … with a week discovering Dublin and its surroundingsPlan a holiday in the first week of September and you’ll only need to take four days of annual leave for a full week’s break, as it will include the last summer bank holiday of the year on 31 August. If you live in the Midlands or the north of England, make the most of P\u0026ampO Ferries’ service from Liverpool for a late summer trip to Dublin. The crossing time is eight and a half hours, there are up to six a day, and you can opt for a daytime or overnight journey. Meals are also included in the price of your ticket.Ireland is known for its festivals, and at the beginning of September, Dublin Fringe clicks into gear. The 16-day event takes over the streets with performances aimed at pushing boundaries and generally making you go: “Eh, what was that?” (but in a good way). The city is also an excellent base for day trips, especially if you’re in need of a nature fix before autumn arrives. The moody landscape of the Wicklow mountains will charm any hillwalker, while coastal towns such as Howth offer up clifftop views and seafood pub lunches.Take four days of holiday after the summer bank holiday (31 August) to get nine days off in a row, including weekends.Memorable holidays start with P\u0026ampO Ferries.

From France to Belgium,  Dixe Wills discovers five ‘no-fly’ camping holidays in Europe, all accessible by ferry Aaah, camping. A chance to slow down, unwind and gently ease back on the throttle of daily life. So it makes no sense to bookend the experience with stressful airports and conscience-troubling flights. Thankfully, there are plenty of great campsites that are easily accessible by ferry, a far more relaxed way of travelling that can become an enjoyable part of your holiday …Mini Camping de Hooiberg, the NetherlandsThe Dutch are inveterate campers and so it’s no surprise that so many campsites in the Netherlands are run by people who really get the whole “life under canvas” vibe. Set on an idyllic organic dairy farm, Mini Camping de Hooiberg is one such site. It’s not just any old dairy farm, either, but an organic one that produces its own unpasteurised cheeses. They’re for sale in the farm shop along with locally made bread, and fruit and vegetables from nearby farms. Open all year, the tree-lined campsite, which has just 25 pitches, has its own cafe, and is situated in Brabantse Kempen, a region of forests, heathland and meadows criss-crossed with walking, cycling and mountain biking routes. And if your idea of camping heaven means not being woken at the crack of dawn by yelping children, then you’re in luck – this site is for grownups only.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Rotterdam. Mini Camping de Hooiberg is a one-and-a-half hour drive from there.Camping Scheibeekhoeve, BelgiumBelgium isn’t a country that one automatically associates with camping, but this makes Camping Scheibeekhoeve an even more joyful find. Set on a farm, with the Scheibeek waterway running around it, the campsite offers some welcome peace, tranquility and fresh country air. There are excellent facilities for those with disabilities, while children can burn off some energy in the play barn or on pedal-powered go-karts. The campsite is situated in rural Sint-Rijkersstraat, half a mile from the small village of Alveringem. It’s also less than 15 miles from the coast, making it well placed for those who fancy a swim in the sea, or a visit to Dunkirk and Ostend, both within easy reach. On the doorstep, there are some excellent cycling routes through Alveringem and the neighbouring municipalities of Veurne, Diksmuide and Lo-Reninge.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Zeebrugge. Camping Scheibeekhoeve is an hour’s drive from the port.Camping du Val-d’Oise, FranceSet among woodland where the deer roam free, Camping du Val-d’Oise has just 40 spacious camping pitches, so it’s never overcrowded. Bread is delivered straight from the ovens of a local bakery, and there are waymarked hiking trails through the Thiérarche countryside to the region’s rather magnificent fortified churches. Or you can follow in the paddle strokes of Robert Louis Stevenson by hiring a canoe and setting off down the often frisky waters of the Oise River.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, Camping du Val-d’Oise is two and a half hours’ drive away.Etangs du Moulin, FranceA little farther afield, in the Aisne countryside, the Etangs du Moulin campsite is truly one of a kind, and perfect for those with children who are resistant to conventional camping. A soupçon of the wild west come to Picardy, the site resembles an old frontier town and offers accommodation in wagons, tipis, log cabins and gypsy caravans (but if you’d rather take your own tent, there’s plenty of space for that too). Twenty-first century comforts include a heated outdoor swimming pool and a Texan-style pub and restaurant, while just beyond the grounds there’s the 9,000-hectatre (22,000-acre) Saint-Gobain forest to explore, which is perfect for both hikers and casual walkers.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, the campsite is less than three hours away by car.Maddybenny farm, Northern IrelandRun by the White family since the 1950s, Maddybenny farm makes an excellent rural base for a coastal adventure. The campsite, tucked behind trees beyond a 17th-century farmhouse, enjoys views down to Portrush, a seaside resort two miles away. There’s a playground for children and, if the weather doesn’t play ball, a games room too. Nearby attractions include the clifftop Mussenden Temple, with its vistas along Downhill Strand, while the pretty seaside town of Ballycastle comes complete with a sandy beach and a harbour. Boats leave there for Rathlin Island, a must for both nature lovers and fans of Robert the Bruce (he reputedly stumbled across his “try, try, try again” spider while in hiding there). The Roe Valley country park is a great place for rambling along the riverbank for a summer picnic or you can head to the ancient market town of Limavady, famous for the Londonderry Air, the tune to Danny Boy.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries has the shortest, fastest and most frequent crossing between Cairnryan and Larne, with up to seven sailings a day and a journey time of two hours. Maddybenny farm is just over an hour’s drive from the port. Alternatively, take the train from Larne, then cycle or walk from the station at Dhu Varren (two miles) or Coleraine (four miles).Sail awayMemorable holidays start with P\u0026ampO Ferries.

It is has served us well for many years as we have steered people - and sometimes ourselves - away from the latest scam or cautioned readers against falling for “bargains” which turn out to be ginormous rip offs. But there is an exception to this golden rule. Our libraries. By almost every single measure we can think of, Irish libraries are remarkable places and something we should cherish and support in every convievable sense. Many people seem to agree. The level of consensus about the importance of libraries became very clear to us last week when we asked Twitter a simple question. This is what we asked: “Do you think libraries have relevance today or are they an out-of date throwback to times past?”Within hours we had received close to a thousand responses, the vast, vast majority of which were singing the praises of our libraries. Many of the resposes were a joy to read and an affirmation that in a world that sometimes seems to be drowing in technolgy-fuelled toxicity there is a place for pleasant positivity. There was also - sadly - much evicdence of that technology-fuelled toxicity too. In fact some people were gravely offended that we would have the temerity to pose the question.“Just reading the tone of this question annoyed me,” one Twitter user responded. “It takes a single Google to discover the sheer vast social power libraries bring. To every organisation and group they touch.”“If you’re asking, you’re out of touch,” another user said. “How could you even ask that question?” wondered someone else. Our question was called daft and one person said they were so angered by it that they would most certainly not be reading any subsequent article on the topic that Pricewtch might write.Most of the others who responded were not so annoyed and were happy to be given the opportuntiy to rave about their local libraries and the wider system as it operates across the country.Terrible mistakeBut here’s the thing. If an alien were to fall to earth and only read the responses to the question we posed on Twitter they would be forgiven for thinking that the vast, vast majority of Irish people genuinely cherish their libraries and use them all the time. But that is not the case, not by a long shot. Rather than cherish our libraries and take advantage of all they have to offer the vast majority of Irish people seem, in fact, happier to turn their backs on them entirely. The numbers don’t lie. Less than 20 per cent of Irish people describe themselves as regular library users which means that more than three million people in this country rarely or never use libraries. The three million are making a terrible mistake. They are missing out on free books – both physical and electronic – free internet access, free DVDs, free Wi-Fi, free self-improving talks, free readings, free newspapers, free magazines and free book clubs. We could go on and on and on. In fact there’s so much free stuff going in the close to 400 libraries around the country that it is hard to know where to start. Actually, it’s easy to know where to start. We should start at the National Library Open Day which takes place this coming Saturday in a library near you. The Open Day is “a special invitation to everyone to come in and see for themselves all that’s on offer at their local library” and as part of the event, libraries across the country will showcase some of the services they offer and will have “friendly staff on hand to join you up and show you around in-library and online services”. It is a brilliant idea and one which should be embraced by everyone. Among the experiences on offer in libraries on Saturday will be a comic illustration workshop and lace making demonstration in Carlow 3D printing and a chance to meet robots in South Dublin a board game bonanza, Lego club and ‘Match Attax Meet Up’ in Cork city. There is a ukulele workshop in Co Cork and a slime workshop in Co Westmeath. That is not all. There will be the chance to play with virtual reality, sow sunflowers and take part in a treasure hunt in Co Wexford. A library in Co Galway will be offering free health checks while there will be chair exercise classes in Co Leitrim. And did we mention that everything which will take place in many of the 330 librries around the State is free? Despite the fact that most people in Ireland seem happy to turn their backs on libraries these are good times for the precious resources. There were over 17 million visits to Irish libraries in 2018, and nearly 14 million items were issued that year. ChangeThey have shown themselves to be wonderfully deft at moving with changing times and give access to more than 500 e-learning courses and 114 language courses. There are 28,000 e-books available and 20,000 e-audio books, as well as 300 international magazine titles and 3,200 accessible newspapers.People who have not set foot inside a library since they last read about Aunt Fanny dispensing lashings of ginger beer and tongue sandwiches to beat the band while Uncle Quentin glowered in his study might, in fact, be shocked by how much libraries have changed since they gave up on them.One big change in recent times has meant that when you join one library in Ireland today you join all of them . You can now order online and pick up a book in Dublin and leave in back in Donegal - the first such library set up in the world. You can browse and download eBooks, audiobooks, eMagazines and e-Newspapers on your phone or other device. There is access to equipment including virtual reality, 3D printing, sensory equipment and laptops. There is free internet access, space to study, work or read and relax, resources to support people looking for work or setting up businesses and information for those interested in local history.And while libraries are about so much more than money, that is to be saved too? How much? Well, an avid reader can cut costs quite a bit by joining a library. Even if you buy a newly released paperback for a tenner – and many cost more than that – by reading five a month someone could handily spend over €700 a year on books, most of which they will only read once.With all the benefits it is a wonder that just 16 per cent of the population are active members of the library.Maybe things will change though. That is certainly the aim of the National Library Strategy which wants to see membership grow to 30 per cent in the next few years. Growing numbersStrategies that have been put in place so far to grow the numbers include the extension of opening hours to better suit busy lives and the removal of late fees and fines to ensure everyone has access to services without fear of penal charges. The strategy aims to expand self-service facilities and widen the My Local Library scheme - a self service system which currently is open 8am – 10pm 365 days a year - to 100 library branches across the country and then 200 branches over the next decade. The strategy will also see greater investment in digital technologies to enhance the service and to bridge the digital ide by developing digital learning centres and offering STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths) and coding workshops. It also seeks to “firmly establish the library as a welcoming, go-to-place locally with skilled staff providing guidance and support and access to communal spaces, services and resources for all people and communities”.While we get many things very wrong in Ireland - and Pricewatch is rarely found wanting when it comes to highlighting the bad stuff - libraries are one thing we appear to be getting very right. Some countries, including the UK and US, have experienced severe cuts to their library services over the past decade which have resulted in reduced library use and book lending, reduced opening hours and library closures.By contrast, in Ireland between 2012 and 2017 there were 45 new or extended library branches and more are planned while expenditure on stock increased by 15 per cent from 2012 to 2016. The last budget saw an increase of investment in libraries from €6.2 million to €7.2 million while almost €3.5 million has been committed from Government to date for the My Open Library scheme and is being matched by local authorities to the value of around €1 million giving a total investment of almost €4.5 million. What our libraries need more than money is your support. If you are one of the millions who are not a member, do something good this week and join up. You’ll be glad you did. There is no question about that. The librarian’s view: ‘It is a joy to work here’If Pricewatch sounds enthusiastic about libraries, then listen to executive librarian from Waterford Libraries Tracy McEneaney talk for a few minutes. “Libraries are for every single person. Everyone who is a member realises how great the service is and we rely on word of mouth to a huge degree. Membership is free and we have abolished the fines that might have been putting people off and also widened the service so when you join one library you are a member of all the libraries so you can take a book out in Waterford and return it in Donegal.”“We have all the best sellers and e-books are a big thing for us now and work with an app called borrowbox. You select your library, input your library number and pin and download the books or audio books you fancy. It is that simple and it is free. I sometimes go to funerals and people will come up to me and tell me that borrowbox kept their granny going. It is lovely to hear that. “And it is not just books we have electronically. We have almost 500 magazines from the New Yorker and the Economist down to Hello available and they are all free. It is brilliant and 10 or 20 years ago none of this stuff was available.“They are not quiet places anymore and the nosiest people are likely to be the librarians and we don’t really shush people. Libraries have become community hubs and there is always something going on. There are thousands of events across the country from talks and book clubs to yoga and health eating workshops. “We get to know our customers – especially in the smaller braches and we know all about the births and the deaths and the hardships and the joys. Come in and ask us what we have on offer. We are practically pulling people off the street. It is a joy to work in a library. But we have to reach the people in Ireland who maybe have not been in a library since they were children. It is great when people come back. I love seeing people who I remember as babies brining their own children through the doors. My message to people would be simply be if you haven’t been to a library in years come back and have a lookYour view: ‘Libraries have never been more relevant’“My local library was a godsend when I was completing my 2 Dissertations in my final year of college.. staff were great too. If I needed a book for reference and it was in another branch they’d transfer it.. Definitely still a much needed \u0026amp wanted facility,” - Babs McMahon “I love the library and withdraw books regularly,” - Oonagh Duggan“They are great resource and learning centres,” - Michael Kelly“I can read all the local and national papers there, and they have book clubs and reading author events. PCs and printers are always busy. Relevant? Never more relevant,” - Frank Smith“The library system in Ireland is brilliant. I am now effective a member of every library. I order my books on their website, they are delivered from whatever library they are in, I get a text to collect them in the local library. I’ve stopped buying books. Our local library at Kevin Street is much loved - refurbished a couple of years ago, it’s a really welcoming place, always busy, and staffed by the loveliest people. I also often drop in to the Cavan Town library, which is brilliant. A sign of civilisation,” - Patricia Reilly“The library in Clonakilty is buzzing with people from the direct provision centre in town, people who don’t have desktop computers using the internet, kids \u0026amp all sorts of other people using it’s many facilities - they’re community hubs, in rural towns at least,” - Beth Wallace“I use my library weekly. My kids love it. They always have books rented out. I order books I want to rent from the library through their website. They e-mail me when they come in. I wish they would open on a Saturday though,” - Guillaume L’Hiver“So relevant and vital - real, untainted information in a peaceful place of refuge,” - Gerr Walsh “I’d a granda who would go every Saturday and get his five novels and read them in a week. That wasn’t a rarity back then. But how society entertains itself has changed. Libraries have had to adapt to that. They seem to be doing a great job of this in the face of severe adversity,” - Abby Oliveira“Granted I work in a library but it’s not a public library. Public libraries are one of the most human and democratic social spaces. I love mine,” - Ger Gregory“How dare you even question their relevance,” - Eoin Murphy“I run a lunchtime bookclub in an inner city disadvantaged secondary school. Cabra library supplies us with the books and has been so helpful. We’re currently reading Pride and Prejudice. It’s a real life line for the students- couldn’t run it without the support of the library,” - Lorraine Ni Mhathuna“Completely relevant. They are more than just book lending facilities, they are community learning and information centres offering facilities people may not have access to at home. They’re also one of the few places people can sit indoors for free,” - Bessie Burgers“I use mine weekly! So relevant and important. Such a great community hub,” - Melanie May“If it wasn’t for one of the local well stocked libraries running a University outreach course, I’d wouldnt be a mature student in TCD right now. Dublin City Libraries doesn’t get a lot of credit or recognition for the stellar work it does in communities that are otherwise bereft of books,” - Mark Egan “A place where kids and teenagers (anyone indeed) can go and get books without having to ask for money for it or have anyone breathing down their neck about it is the kind of freedom that’s getting a bit too scarce these days,” - Stephen Bourke“I would be LOST without my library!!! I am an avid reader. I get a new book for my birthday and Christmas. Besides that I get books at my local library once every few weeks. Call me a nerd but the feeling I get leaving my library with about six books in hand ... can’t beat it!” - Sharon Mulry"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4183106.1582537611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus travellers to italy advised to keep abreast of developments","story":"Almost a dozen towns in northern Italy are on lockdown as the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe surpasses 100 and continues to grow.

Photograph: Guglielmo MangiapaneReuters The Department of Health’s chief medical officer is advising anyone contemplating travel to Italy to keep up to date on developments as the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) convenes an emergency meeting this afternoon.Dr Tony Holohan’s advice follows news of three deaths in Italy and the first major travel restrictions to be imposed in Europe. Northern Italy has seen more than 50,000 people in a number of towns in the Veneto and Lombardy regions quarantined. Italian officials have cancelled sporting events, closed schools and businesses and cut short the Venice carnival.The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was updating its travel advice regularly to reflect developments in the outbreak. Its current travel advice for Italy notes the presence of cases in the country but does not offer any country-specific advice.Dr Holohan told Newstalk Breakfast that Ireland is well prepared. “We’ve been working for a number of weeks now since this began, to put in place the arrangements we have that have helped us to prepare our system to identify cases at an early stage . . . Were a case to arise, and no cases have occurred in this country as yet, measures will be put in place to stop the spread to other people.”Dr Holohan said the Department of Health has been monitoring the international situation “very closely”.“As part of the international community that we work with on this, specifically the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), we’ll be monitoring and updating the advice and guidance that we give to the health services, with regard to travel advice.“Anybody who has travelled and is concerned, who experiences symptoms of common cold or flu like symptoms should make contact with their GP by telephone, not to attend, and to be guided from there. Anybody who has queries and concerns can contact HSELive, which is providing information on continuous basis, on 1850 24 1850.“There is still a belief that this may be possible, but what we’ve seen in Italy over the course of recent days, which is a number of specific locations where cases have arisen in people where there is no documented travel history. That gives us reason to believe that there is community transmission happening in that part of the world, and for that reason the ECDC convened an extraordinary meeting this afternoon at which some of these kind of issues are going to be looked at and where I anticipate the public health advice that we’ll be giving to people in respect of Italy is likely to change.“Anybody who is contemplating travel to that part of the world should remain abreast of the situation,” he said.Ryanair and Aer Lingus both fly to Milan in Lombardy.

Since January, it has spread to 26 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen.It has been fatal in 2 per cent of reported cases, with the elderly and ill the most vulnerable, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), which said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China.The three airports that serve Milan, including Bergamo – where Ryanair has a base – continued their services as normal at the weekend.Lombardy and Veneto said they would close schools for a week beginning on Monday while the affected regions postponed carnivals, football matches and fashion shows.–Additional reporting Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man (40s) dies after suspected collision with ditch in Wicklow motorcyclist (32) dies in KilkennyTaoiseach to visit affected areas on Monday as forecast remains bad for the weekA more showery outlook means flooding may not get much worseHealth department\u0026rsquos chief medical officer says country is well prepared if case arisesDecision is to have potentially huge implications for State\u0026rsquos fight against crimeSuspect accused of murdering Patricia O\u0026rsquoConnor and dismembering her remainsSmall hotels, guesthouses, construction sub contractors now facing insurance difficultiesDepartment of Foreign Affairs \u0026lsquomonitoring\u0026rsquo outbreak as sharp rise in cases outside ChinaDepartment seeks to stop practice of placing pupils in \u0026lsquofree classes\u0026rsquo to fit in junior cycle meetingsDepartment of Education insists no school will lose out next year under new reformsParties should adopt internationally-recognised working definition, says representative bodyConcern that abuse victim faced in court will stop others coming forwardInternal audits find serious risks in Dublin north city and Cavan-MonaghanAll parties to intensify engagements to explore government formationGlut of former TDs put names forward for Upper House election as deadline loomsJunior staff causing high level of unnecessary admissions, according to senior doctorsJean Vanier revelations spark concern over financesOfficials indicate St Patrick\u0026rsquos Day festivities in Washington will be prioritised even if government-formation talks are ongoingDecision to have potentially huge implications for State\u0026rsquos fight against crimeStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4182665.1582490215!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin and varadkar to hold exploratory talks on possible coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe meeting between the two leaders takes place in a week in which all parties will intensify engagements to explore government formation. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin will hold exploratory talks on Tuesday to determine if there is a basis for a historic first coalition between the two parties which have dominated Irish politics for a century.With Fine Gael signalling a growing willingness over the weekend to re-examine its preference to go into opposition, Mr Varadkar is expected to report back to his parliamentary party on Wednesday if there is a basis for pursuing matters further with Mr Martin. The meeting takes place in a week in which all parties will intensify engagements to explore government formation. Sinn Féin and the Green Party will begin two days of detailed policy discussions on Monday. Sinn Féin has also announced a series of public rallies around the State over the next fortnight. It is hoping large attendances will increase public pressure on the other two big parties to reverse their refusal to enter talks with it.Separately, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said his party will hold similar two-day policy discussions with Fianna Fáil later this week, and Fine Gael early next week. The party is reluctant to go into any coalition with two bigger parties alone, and wants other smaller parties as participants. As things stand Mr Varadkar has no mandate from Fine Gael to negotiate a formal programme for government, and the party’s formal position is that it is preparing for opposition, with the onus falling on Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin to form a government.However, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris’s comments on Friday – where he said he agreed with a PSNI assessment from 2015 of a remaining IRA influence on Sinn Féin – have reinforced Mr Martin’s stance not to to enter any coalition talks with that party’s president Mary Lou McDonald. Until Mr Harris’s comments some Fianna Fáil TDs had privately questioned if Mr Martin’s trenchant exclusion of Sinn Féin, plus his willingness to enter talks with Fine Gael, was the correct strategy for the party.Within senior levels of both parties there is now a growing sense that a coalition involving them is the only remaining pathway to a stable majority government.A Fine Gael spokesman said its mandate as one of three main parties would have to be respected in the composition of any programme for government and composition of Cabinet. Sources said Fine Gael could demand a rotating taoiseach and an acceptance by Fianna Fáil it is not the lead party. Very arrogantOn Sunday, Fianna Fáil TD Robert Troy said his party should be considered the lead party but this was described by one senior Fine Gael source as “very arrogant”.“It’s hard to see any basis for meaningful talks this week if Mr Martin takes a similar approach when he meets the Taoiseach,” said the source.On Sunday Sinn Féin repeated its strong denial that the Provisional IRA retained any influence over Sinn Féin.“The IRA has gone, and they are not coming back. That’s the reality,” Donegal TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics. Deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said Mr Harris’s comments had been manipulated by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.“It comes at a time when they are shaping up to do more of the same together in an attempt to carve up political power for themselves.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

The one-time Conservative Party chairman, now Lord Patten, said the Tory government’s proposed points-based immigration system - unveiled last week and aimed at reducing the number of lower-paid EU workers - would cause problems for the UK’s healthcare, agrifood and hospitality sectors.Mr Patten said that tackling EU migration has always been “an easy way for politicians appearing to tackle the issue in a firm way which can satisfy popular sentiment” when most immigration comes from outside the EU.“Stopping more people coming in seasonally to pick potatoes and stopping the recruitment of Romanians to work at very low pay in care homes isn’t a very sophisticated way of dealing with labour market problems,” he told The .Speaking ahead of delivering a lecture in Dublin on Tuesday evening, Mr Patten said that future labour market shortages as a result of declining fertility rates and ageing populations in Europe would not be solved with a “few simple slogans or catching a few headlines”.Mr Patten, a vociferous opponent of Brexit, described this “big demographic problem” as “a much more sophisticated and awkward issue” that could not be solved by “any European country on its own, even Britain outside the European Union”.‘Weird’ mafia The former senior Tory criticised the powerful role given by British leader Boris Johnson to his iconoclastic adviser Dominic Cummings. He described the aide as the “capo of the weirdos” - a reference to Mr Cummings inviting “weirdos and misfits” to apply to work at Downing Street.Mr Patten said Mr Cummings had “astonishing influence” at No 10 and across the government. He questioned the motivation behind plans by Downing Street to take on the judiciary, abolish the BBC licence fee and challenge other institutions that hold the governing executive to account.“There is an agenda to eliminate any impediments to the exercise of executive authority in the name of majoritarianism,” he said. He called Downing Street’s anti-establishment plans an “assault” on institutions that could impede “whatever it is that an executive under dominant No 10 control wants to do”.“You have precious few institutions left which can actually stand up to a government which is doing crazy things,” said the former chairman of the BBC.“Even active politicians” who point out difficulties with actions being taken by the prime minister “have a very short shelf life”, he added.Smith sackingHe pointed to Mr Johnson’s sacking of Julian Smith as Northern Ireland secretary because he “intellectually disagreed” with an uncompromising prime minister by contradicting him on Brexit and warning that a no-deal exit would be bad for Northern Ireland. Mr Patten, who chaired the body that transformed the Royal Ulster Constabulary into the Police Service of Northern Ireland, described Mr Smith as the best Northern secretary “for years”. He blamed the UK government for reneging on commitments given to the EU in the political declaration by hardening its position before talks begin on a post-Brexit trade agreement. There was still a view in the Tory government that “cakeism rules, as though we can have our cake and eat it - alas, that is not true,” he said. If a trade deal is reached, it will be because the UK has “backed down” as London did on the Irish Border issue by agreeing to have a trade border in the Irish Sea.The British peer, now chancellor of Oxford University, will be speaking on “The Future of Liberal Democracy” in St Anne’s Church on Tuesday night in a lecture organised by Studies, the quarterly journal published by the Jesuits, in honour of the late businessman Peter Sutherland. Mr Patten said that he has found the Brexit era of British politics “the most depressing period of my life and it goes beyond politics”. He said his children were “uniformly hostile” to Brexit “not because of any exaggerated enthusiasm for European institutions, but they just can’t understand why a pretty reasonable example of international cooperation with our neighbours, is somehow now regarded as treachery”.“I find it difficult to be anything other than exceptionally skeptical about the idea that Britain unbound is going to become a great global powerhouse as though we haven’t been important globally for centuries. I mean we have,” he said.  Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

That includes white, working class men - a group that went for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. What the Nevada caucuses indicate, however, is that Mr Sanders has an ability to build a coalition of voters beyond the narrow section that is typically associated with him. Entrance polls showed that Mr Sanders won 51 per cent of Hiic voters - a remarkable statistic. In other words, more than ever other candidate put together. He also, according to the polls, won a quarter of African-American voters, a demographic he struggled with in his bid for the presidency four years ago. If there was doubt before Nevada, there is no longer - Bernie is the front-runner in this race. Those seeking to unpack the Sanders phenomenon have many theories to grasp. But one, surely, which cannot be overlooked is the fact that Democrats really do like Medicare-for-all. Entrance polls - based on what people are thinking just before they go in to vote - taken in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada all show the much-debated proposal is popular. The breakdown was 57 per cent support to 38 per cent opposition in Iowa, 58 per cent to 37 per cent in New Hampshire and 62 per cent to 35 per cent in Nevada, according to NBC polls. Yet for all its popularity, only two candidates in the race are promising Medicare-for-all. Mr Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and fellow progressive. Even between them, it is Mr Sanders who wrote the proposed legislation - claiming often on the trail “I wrote the damn bill” - while Ms Warren frames the policy as more of a medium-term goal. For moderates, opposition to the plan, which gives government-funded healthcare to all Americans and scraps private insurance, has been a stick with which to beat Mr Sanders. Maybe they misread the party’s base? “The comeback kid!” shouted someone from the crowd as Joe Biden gave his results night speech in Nevada, echoing the nickname Bill Clinton gave himself during his 1992 primaries comeback. That was certainly the message being pushed by the Biden camp as the former US vice president put in a much improved performance in the third state to vote in the race. Following his fourth and fifth place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr Biden came in the top three here - a relative improvement that allows his team to claim momentum. “The press is ready to declare people dead quickly.” Mr Biden told his supporters. “But we\u0027re alive and we\u0027re coming back and we\u0027re going to win!”Whether the years-long front-runner failing to win any of the first three states really is positive news is another question. But the freefall narrative will be over for now. Entrance polls showed he won among African-American voters, getting 36 per cent to Mr Sanders’s 25 per cent.  It is now all on South Carolina.If Mr Biden wins there - as he said on Saturday that he would - the comeback narrative will be fully up and running. But fall short and it looks bad for Super Tuesday. In the last fortnight the two leading women still in the race had the strongest moments of their campaigns.For Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator and moderate, it was coming in a strong third place in New Hampshire, winning a fifth of the votes and leading to claims of Klobmentum. For Ms Warren, it was her brutal take-down of billionaire Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, challenging him on nondisclosure agreements, that breathed new life into her bid. But in Nevada, neither got the breakout success they would have been dreaming about, failing to break into the top three.For both candidates and others lower down the table one big question begins to loom - how long can they realistically stay in the race? Both will remain on the ballot for South Carolina and likely for Super Tuesday, when 14 different states vote. But something dramatic will need to change to progress beyond that. An outsider septuagenarian who exudes authenticity and pitches bold policies versus a string of moderates all battling to be the centrist torch-bearer, thereby splitting the vote. That was the story of Donald Trump’s unlikely path through the Republican primaries on his way to the White House in 2016 and is starting to become the story of this cycle too. While Mr Sanders romped home to victory in Nevada, the vote for the moderates - or the Stop Bernie wing, as they could be called - was split every which way. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend mayor, got a sizable chunk of the vote. So did Mr Biden. Ms Klobuchar got some votes, though not lots. And that is all before Mr Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has poured close to half a billion dollars into advertising, jumps into the race on Super Tuesday. Who should be the leading moderate? That is now the critical question in the race. The answer is Democratic voters just do not seem to know, for now at least. The longer it is Mr Sanders versus a split field of centrists, the better for him - just like Mr Trump in 2016, when the failure to coalesce around one opponent eased his path to victory. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont forgive no peace afghans talibans birthplace back nascent","story":"Every phase of Afghanistan\u0027s four decades of war has left traces around the rocky Ghargi police outpost overlooking the Panjwayi district of Kandahar.Rusting tanks sinking into the stony slopes date to when Soviet troops battled Mujahideen in the surrounding orchards and vineyards.A brief drive away is Sangisar, the birthplace of the Taliban where Mullah Omar first raised his militia of religious students to fight the warlords who thrived after the Russians left. More recent sandbagged trenches and bullet-pocked buildings date to when Western troops fought the Taliban.For the past seven years, the outpost has been manned only by local Afghan police who guard the mobile phone towers. The years of fighting have extracted a heavy cost from the people of Panjwayi.Haji Mohammad Rassoul, a local elder, has lost a brother, a police chief in nearby Shorabak district, and a son, also a policeman.“I am preparing food for their children,” he said over a lunch of mutton and aubergine. “Every home is like that.”Eighteen months of negotiation in Doha between America and the Taliban have produced the beginnings of a peace process. A seven-day semi-truce has begun, which if it holds will tee-up a formal accord on February 29. United States troops will begin to withdraw and the militants will sit down with Afghan leaders to begin what will be lengthy and difficult talks on how to run the country. Diplomats are cautious, but say the accord is the best chance yet the country has had to find a political settlement to the conflict.The United Nations\u0027 latest tally of civilian casualties found the conflict killed or injured around 10,400 people last year.Haji Mohammad recalls well when the Taliban first arose in the area in the autumn of 1994, in response to the lawlessness of what was then a civil war.At first they were welcomed as they disarmed bandits and secured the countryside. Later their punishments, including hangings and the cutting off of thieves\u0027 hands, and their rules and austere interpretation of Islam began to alienate residents.“They had good security, but nothing more. They ruled by cruelty,” Haji Mohammad said.Despite that, he would welcome them if they were to join Afghan politics and lay down their weapons.“If I don\u0027t forgive them, then peace can\u0027t come again,” he said.The Taliban\u0027s deputy leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, last week used the opinion pages of the New York Times to try to reassure the West about the group\u0027s intentions.Haqqani, a wanted terrorist known for ordering car bombings, said the militants now wanted an “inclusive political system” and they would guarantee women their Islamic rights to study and work.No one the  spoke to wanted a return to the strict governance of a Taliban-led government. But some kind of power-sharing or admittance to parliament could work, they suggested.“If they come and join the government, then we don\u0027t have a problem,” said another police commander, Abdullah Khan, from his outpost overlooking Zangiabad.Some predicted the Taliban were no longer as strict as at their founding. “I think that this next time, they will be changed,” said 60-year-old Abdul Ghafur. “They will not insist that people have big beards and turbans and stop girls from going to school.”Whether Panjwayi\u0027s women were as confident was unclear. Few could be seen during the \u0027s visit.The residents also have mixed feelings about the foreign troops in the country.In Panjwayi the thousands of first Canadian and then American troops who patrolled from 2006 onwards are blamed for making violence worse, not better.Local people liken the Taliban to flies attracted to foreign troops. Americans built the large district compound centre from where the deputy police chief, Nasar Mohammad, now leads his men.The walls are still the bland beige found in all such buildings, but he has added his own touches.A greenhouse holds his collection of flowers. A corner of the compound where armoured vehicles once parked is now an enclosure for his menagerie of iridescent pheasants and small deer.He entertains guests on carpets laid where US combat boots once crunched over gravel.The chief voices a familiar criticism of foreign forces. With all their technology and might, why were they unable to defeat a rag-tag band of religious students?“It was very easy for the Americans to push the Taliban out, but they did not want to. They said their cameras meant they could see something tiny all the way from Kandahar airport, thirty miles away. Why couldn\u0027t they do anything in Panjwayi?” he said.He himself would be keen to see the back of foreign troops as part of any deal.Others point to the 1990s, when the world\u0027s abandonment of Afghanistan after the Cold War allowed it to fall into civil war. They say they want Americans to stay, albeit conducting aid work, not fighting.Security in central Panjwayi has already improved. The replacement of troops by locally recruited police had smoothed over tribal differences that fanned the insurgency, residents said. During the American time, Nasar Mohammad said he had often needed a convoy of up to 40 armoured vehicles to cross his territory.Now he simply jumps in a car and he has not lost a man in Panjwayi for seven years.Much of the rest of Afghanistan is not so fortunate though, and illustrating the shifting patchwork of the conflict, he said there were heavy casualties in neighbouring Maiwand.If this week\u0027s truce holds, then talks between the Taliban and Afghan leaders are scheduled to begin quickly, in either Norway or Germany. Those talks are likely to be the most difficult part of any peace process. Ashraf Ghani\u0027s government has so far been shut out of negotiations, with the Taliban rejecting him as a US puppet. As US troops withdraw, his negotiating hand weakens. Moreover Afghanistan\u0027s politicians are currently at loggerheads over the disputed result of September\u0027s presidential election.Mr Ghani was declared victor, only for his rival Abdullah Abdullah to reject the result and threaten a rival government. Just choosing who should negotiate with the Taliban is expected to be fraught. Rogue Taliban factions, Islamic State group and even players in the government may try to sabotage the talks. Diplomats caution that talks could take years, if they do not grind to a halt.Yet in Panjwayi, where the summer heat is already rising and the fields will soon be thick with grapes and pomegranates, residents are also hoping to see shoots of peace.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"canary islands sandstorm british holidaymakers stranded airports","story":"British holidaymakers are stranded at airports in the Canary Islands after a Saharan sandstorm. Flights from Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma and North Tenerife Airports were cleared for take off early on Monday morning after hours of delays due to the weather conditions. Flights from South Tenerife remain grounded.Passengers have posted photographs of people sitting on the floor waiting for more information.Greg Horsman, 29, was on holiday with his girlfriend and his friends on a Tui cruise and was due to fly home to Manchester on Saturday evening.However, they have been forced to stay in Gran Canaria for another two nights due to the storm.He told PA: It\u0027s frustrating. We\u0027re just ready to be home.Last night we were in the airport for five hours and I was frustrated because Tui couldn\u0027t help us or do anything until the airport declared that they were closed which they did at 10.30pm.Tui reps did give us updates when we asked but unfortunately it didn\u0027t seem they were getting much information quickly.We then spent the night there, most of us in our original cabins, then came back to the airport at 12.30pm and have been here since.We are being sent to a hotel tonight but we\u0027re not sure where we\u0027re going to yet.He added: We\u0027re frustrated because there should be contingency plans for when a weather event grounds flights.They all kept saying: \u0027Oh, we\u0027ve never seen this happen before\u0027, which I understand, it\u0027s a freak of nature. But when weather grounds all flights there is surely a contingency plan that gets put into place so people can get accommodation sorted.Graham Whiteman, 30, arrived at Las Palmas airport at 5pm on Saturday night, but discovered his Tui flight back to Doncaster - which he was due to be on with his fiancee and her family - had been cancelled.He said: We were told we needed to check the boards for updates.We didn\u0027t get any and then at 1.30am we found a Tui rep, who then sorted us out with a hotel room on the other side of the island at 4am.We got an email at 7.58am saying a coach would be leaving the hotel at 8.30am to take us to the airport and we\u0027ve been here ever since.He added: I am type 1 diabetic and when I explained to a Tui rep that I will not have enough insulin for the next 24 hours, their response was that they would deal with it when it becomes an emergency.The duty of care for their customers is a disgrace. They do not want to take responsibility for anything or anyone. Children and elderly adults having no option but to sit and sleep on the dirty airport floors.We understand the weather conditions are not their fault but how they have catered for their customers is disgusting. It\u0027s basically a failure of Tui and their staff.A spokeswoman for Tui said: We would like to sincerely apologise to customers for the disruption caused by the adverse and changeable weather conditions in the Canary Islands on Saturday February 22 and Sunday February 23.The safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority and we are working tirelessly to find the best solutions for all our customers.Everyone is being provided with food and drinks as well as being supported by our Tui reps. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this is causing and would like to thank our customers for their co-operation and patience.Elsewhere, Britons have posted photographs of the orange sky on the islands as the wind continued to batter seaside towns.Michael Nixon, who is on holiday in Tenerife with his family to celebrate his 50th birthday and is due to fly home to Newcastle on Wednesday, said pink dust had covered his rented apartment balcony.He said: It\u0027s all a bit surreal. A heavy mist came in last night followed by very strong gusty winds during the night.This morning we awoke to yellowish haze and strong winds.We ventured out but it\u0027s difficult to see with all of the sand in the air.We are slightly concerned that our flight home on Wednesday could be affected.The sky is still yellow. It\u0027s around 29C (84F) but visibility is around 200m.Meanwhile in the UK, flights out to the Canary Islands are being delayed or cancelled due to the sandstorm.Tim Crew, 69, had booked a holiday to Lanzarote with his family after cancelling their previous holiday to Hong Kong and Thailand because of the coronavirus outbreak.Their BA flight out of Gatwick Airport on Sunday has been cancelled and the family has been booked into a hotel.He said: It\u0027s one of those things really. If no one had talked to us and if there had been obvious problems and culpability, I\u0027d probably be quite annoyed.But everyone\u0027s done the right thing. The pilot came out a few times and told us in person and apologised, saying they had no more news at the moment and they were going to send us to a hotel.It\u0027s not great, it\u0027s not how I planned it, it\u0027s not what I want, but these things happen.A spokeswoman for British Airways said: We\u0027ve been looking after our customers and have offered hotel accommodation and meal vouchers to those who were due to travel on the flight to Tenerife that has been delayed by the sandstorm.We\u0027re staying in regular contact with our customers and we look forward to getting them on their way tomorrow.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/12/11/Rishi-Sunak.jpg","title":"budget surplus chancellor rishi sunak uk government","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.January\u0026nbspsurplus comes in at £9.8bn, lower than the consensus forecast of £11.4bnThe UK posted a smaller than expected\u0026nbspbudget\u0026nbspsurplus in January, a month that traditionally sees an inflow of tax revenues, according to figures that highlighted the challenge facing incoming chancellor Rishi Sunak.The surplus, excluding public sector-owned banks, stood at £9.8bn, down by £2.1bn\u0026nbspor 18 per cent\u0026nbspfrom January 2019, the Office for National Statistics\u0026nbspsaid.

They’re the ones who have the deepest sense of who they are, and what they value, and what they care about.”Mr Buttigieg then paid tribute to his husband Chasten, who was sat in the\u0026nbspfront row of the audience.Buttigieg mocks Trump for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels“And one of those people by the way, one of the strongest people I know, is my husband, Brad Pitt.”During his interview with Ms DeGeneres, Mr Buttigieg also questioned\u0026nbspto what extent Mr Trump meets the traditional definition of masculinity: “You know, when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan, Donald Trump was working on season seven\u0026nbspof Celebrity Apprentice.”As the Democratic presidental primary continues, Mr Buttigieg is still riding high from his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, but has yet to rise towards the top of the national polls, in which Bernie Sanders still leads the other candidates by a significant margin.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, in recent years, rents have skyrocketed in the city of more than 3.7 million inhabitants, pushing middle class families from Berlin’s central residential neighbourhoods like Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg to the outskirts. Even traditionally working class and immigrant neighbourhoods like Neukoelln or Kreuzberg have become so gentrified that long-time tenants can no longer afford the rising rents.Idyllic Italian town offers to pay new residents’ rentIn addition there is an overall housing shortage in Berlin, which makes it even more difficult for newcomers or those who get pushed out of their homes due to the rent spike to find new, affordable living accommodations.The rent freeze is supposed to keep rents for apartments that were built before 2014 at the current level for the next five years. Critics have pointed out that the rent freeze will keep landlords from investing any money into much-needed renovations of homes, because they cannot raise the rent afterward.Tenants, who think their rent isover-priced, have been encouraged by pro-tenant organizations to ask their landlords for a reduction in rent. However, the controversial law has been taken to court by its opponents and some experts have warned tenants to keep all the extra money that they may now be saving on the side, in case the rent freeze is eventually overturned in court.The rent freeze, which was implemented by Berlin’s left-leaning coalition government, has been strongly criticised by Chancellor Angela Merkel‘s more conservative Christian Democrats, who are in the opposition in Berlin’s city-state government.In a statement on Sunday, the Berlin faction of the Christian Democrats wrote that, “the law is not a solution for the continuing housing shortage... The freeze does not help anybody if, in the end, saved rent has to possibly be paid back.” Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several of their leaders have talked about bringing impeachment proceedings against ministers and even the country’s president Hassan Rouhani.A previous attempt to initiate impeachment proceedings against Mr Rouhani failed to get off the ground in the reformist dominated parliament, but the numbers have now changed drastically.At the very least there are likely to be attempts to curb the power of the president and his\u0026nbspforeign minister\u0026nbspMohammad Javad Zarif, two key figures instrumental\u0026nbspin driving through an agreement with international powers on the country’s nuclear programme.The hardliners had vehemently opposed that deal, holding that it compromised the state’s security and insisting the west would renege on it sooner or later. They have also accused the president and senior ministers of turning a blind eye to corruption.The outcome of any impeachment move would ultimately depend on the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the\u0026nbsp Council,\u0026nbspthe powerful election supervisory body.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The turnout was more than 62 per cent each time.People had then flocked to vote in a wave of optimism after the nuclear deal with the anticipation of political and\u0026nbspsocial changes, the economy transforming and excitement at\u0026nbspIran reopening to the outside world.But Donald Trump’s drive to dismantle the agreement, pulling the US out of it and then imposing punitive sanctions, has left the economy struggling. There has also been mounting anger at political corruption, inefficiency and the failure to deliver on many of the promises made by the government.Ayatollah Khamenei\u0026nbspand Mr Rouhani had repeatedly exhorted the electorate to vote, declaring that a failure to do so would be used by the US and its allies as a sign of popular discontent against the state.The supreme leader claimed that “enemy propaganda”\u0026nbspin the form of publicising\u0026nbspthe spread of coronavirus in the country has been used to dissuade people from voting.But interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli pointed to the rising toll from the virus, with six dead so far, as one of the main factors in people staying away from the polling stations. He also maintained “we believe that the number of votes and the turnout is absolutely acceptable”.There were signs of regret among some of those who had opted not to vote. Farah Mazandaranihad voted for reformists in the previous parliamentary election and for Mr Rouhani for president.The 23-year-old student had abstained from voting this time out of dismay at the government’s performance and also in protest at the decision by the  Council to reject a total of 6,850 candidates out of 14,000.“A lot of my friends and I decided not to vote, this was not ignoring politics but taking our own form of political action”, she wanted to explain. “We are now worried that they may use it to try control things like women’s rights even more. Perhaps we will think again at the presidential election”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Godfather 2 is the exception, not the rule. With their small budgets, bad actors, terrible scripts, sequels are often a disappointment. The issue is that they are so often the product of money-grabbing film execs, less concerned about making a good movie than trading off the success of the original.\u0026nbspWe would all be better off if studios focussed on making something new rather than trying to insert life back into what’s gone before. Let the detective stay dead, leave the couple at the wedding altar, let that airborne virus remain in remittance. Ignore the investor whispering in your ear: the monstrously big shark does not need to eat more tourist’s legs off.\u0026nbspPeople never learn. A sequel to romantic classic PS I Love You is currently in development. No, you won’t have to watch Hillary Swank lose her husband twice, nor does he come back from the dead. But you will have to endure more tragedy PS I Love You’s sequel will see Holly helping the terminally ill write to their loved ones.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPS No One Loves a Sequel. To prove it here is the most unnecessary examples on record.Click through the gallery below to see the list.Created with Sketch.The 27 worst film sequels of all time Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry. Some types of wood, such as oak, will require longer.Pieces of wet wood will make a dull thud when knocked together, while you can spot dry wood by looking for cracks, a dull colour and loose bark. The logs will also feel lighter.Dry wood is not only better for the environment, but burning it gives off more heat - making it more efficient, while your stove will require less cleaning and maintenance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course public safety must trump the wellbeing of jihadis.And it’s what Brits want: the Conservatives were elected on a manesto to restore law and order to this country.Unfortunately, peers don’t have to worry about constituents. However they vote and whatever they say, we can never remove them. Which is why they can block necessary and popular legislation when it takes their fancy.Well, we’ve got news for them. The House of Lords limps on because abolishing it is not at the forefront of the public’s mind. Butpeers allow ANOTHER convicted terrorist to maim and kill on our streets, it sure will be.And then the whole sorry institution will be living on borrowed time.BULLYING and banning things is no way to turn this country green.Hiking fuel tax will make the lives of ordinary people harder. As will banning petrol cars for electric ones when there’s no adequate nationwide charging system. Phasing out wood-burning stoves is another sop to the nanny state.And because Brits are eco-conscious already, none of these moves is remotely necessary. Over a third of us have installed a smart meter to monitor energy usage, and four-fths are making an effort to save energy at home.The Government is welcome to give us tempting incentives to stay green.But bossy bans and taxes must end now.IF EU officials believe our Government will cave in to their ludicrous demands, they have another thing coming.When timid Theresa May was leading a minority Government, the EU could strongarm Britain into anything.But now the Leave campaign has been transplanted to No with a whopping mandate, the scales of power have tipped. If the EU can grasp this fact, these trade talks might prove fruitful.If not, Britain will walk out. And European politicians will be the ones to face the music at the ballot box.THREE cheers for our new blue passports. They are a welcome restoration of a powerful symbol of sovereignty.Most Brits consider themselves British, not European, citizens.So EU-issued burgundy passports always rubbed us up the wrong way.At last, a real sign that Britain is OUT.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson must know this is his one big chance for a bold and imaginative boost to the whole economy.As a senior minister warned on Sunday: “You don’t make the North rich by making the South poor.“Nor did the Red Wall ­collapse because those new Tory voters wanted more socialism.”Sunak’s first Budget should be the single most ­dramatic moment of the early Johnson era, setting Brexit Britain’s course as a sovereign trading nation.March , , must stand comparison with the stunning Tory Budgets of Geoffrey Howe in  and Nigel Lawson in  — both high water marks in the fortunes of post-war Britain.Otherwise, what was the point of the bombshell Cabinet shake-up that toppled Sajid Javid and sent shockwaves through our mandarin-dominated Whitehall machine Budget Day is an unrepeatable chance to show that UK plc is open for business — and begin repairing the damage inflicted by previous Chancellors.It’s no good saying Sunak had only four weeks to rewrite Javid’s tax and spending plans.What is the point of a whizz-kid with all those Goldman Sachs-charged brain cellshe can’t deliver the revolution we need This opportunity — more or less marking Boris Johnson’s first  days since the election — will not come again.If the Treasury has been doing its job, it will have drafted contingency plans for every possible challenge — tax cuts, spending leaps, higher thresholds or merging income tax with National Insurance contributions.It will have cost-and-benefit assessments for all eventualities, from a new p top rate to picking cities like Liverpool, Belfast and Glasgow as job-magnet freeports.The Treasury has a blinkered view about tax. It is a means of raising money, on a one-way ratchet.The Treasury does not do “dynamic” economics — lowering taxes and leaving voters to splash their newly acquired cash.This is where Sunak can earn his spurs as an innovative, daring, free-thinking Treasury boss. Stamp duty tops everyone’s calls for reform.George Osborne’s loathed property tax hike paralysed the housing market, locked up billions in hoarded capital, destroyed job mobility — and reduced Treasury revenues.Cutting stamp duty would instantly free up spending and boost the whole economy — especially for tradesmen and the hard-hit High Street.Speaking of shops, business rates need drastic reform to save our shuttered town centres. Why not tax the property owners instead of their struggling tenant shop-keepers All these measures would boost productivity — the amount we earn as a country for every hour worked.Ours is woeful. The average French worker produces more in four days than we do in a full week.Firms have learned to rely on cheap foreign labour, subsidised by taxpayers with welfare top-ups.Home Secretary Priti Patel’s immigration shake-up will cut the flow of cheap labour and force firms to pay proper wages for low-paid care home and service industry workers.The Chancellor can also help by reforming the Factory Tax and encouraging firms to invest in new machinery and technology — the key to economic growth.Whatever Sunak does on March , his duty is to make sure Britain is braced and ready for Brexit.Whatever he does will upset the critics. Sir Geoffrey Howe’s revolutionary  Budget was denounced by  “top” economists in The Times.In , the SNP’s Alex Salmond was booted out of the Commons for heckling Nigel Lawson’s tax-slashing measures.Together those controversial budgets cured Britain as the Sick Man Of Europe and began  years of unbroken economic growth.We need Rishi Sunak to walk in their giant footsteps and turn Britain into the offshore economic dynamo so feared by our erstwhile European partners.It has bluffed its way through the past few decadesby posturing as an integrated political and economic colossus.In reality, like the Wizard Of Oz, it has concealed its naked corruption, barefaced greed and brazen incompetence behind a curtain of bluster and denial.Britain was always there to impose reality on this world of self-delusion.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said it was currently illegal to sell such products - and said there were “no plans” to change the law. But three times he refused to rule it out in future. “We’re absolutely clear as a Government we will not take risks either without food standards and when it comes to animal welfare we will be projecting our views on the international stage,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. He said “lactic acid washes” are used more in the States than chlorine, adding: “What I’m saying is we won’t make any moves on our standards. “We’ve got a clear position in this country that it is illegal to sell chlorine-washed chicken, illegal to sell beef treated with hormones, we have no plans to change those things.” Lib Dem food spokesman Tim Farron said: “Farming communities up and down the country are rightly concerned about being undercut by low-standard imports from the US. “With the Tories’ desperation for a trade deal with Donald Trump, it would appear they are rolling back on their promises. “They are wilfully threatening British consumers and farmers.” The Cabinet meets on Tuesday to agree its demands for a Canada-style trade deal with Brussels - which has already been ruled out by the EU’s top negotiator, Michel Barnier. The plan is expected to be published to Parliament on Thursday. In a move aimed at piling pressure on the EU, the “mandate” for trade talks with the US will be published next week - meaning the UK can negotiate with the EU and the US at the same time. Supporters believe the ploy would allow Britain to play one off against the other. The UK and EU have until December  to strike a trade deal before tarfs and quotas could be imposed under World Trade Organisation rules.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have further raised tensions with the Queen after being forced to abandon plans to market themselves as “Royal”. In a move described as ­“extraordinary” and “petulant”, the couple published complaints on their Sussex Royal website, which will have to be redesigned within weeks. They questioned the power of the Queen and the Government, saying there is no legal case to stop them trading on the royal name abroad. The statement read: “While there isn’t any jurisdiction by The Monarchy or Cabinet Office over the use of the word ‘Royal’ overseas, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use ‘Sussex Royal’ or any iteration of the word ‘Royal’ in any territorywhen the transition occurs in Spring .” The couple suggested they were being treated unfairly after the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William agreed to allow them to leave The Firm. As big banks and corporations queue up to work with them, they have been told to prove they can make it work while not profiting off the royal brand. In what is also being seen as a “highly inflammatory” move, Harry and Meghan ­insisted they will ­continue to receive taxpayer-funded security despite no deal being reached between the UK and Canada, where they are currently living with son Archie.  The statement read: “While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the ­institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month ­review period has been put in place.” A royal source said: “It’s pretty clear they are referencing minor royals such as Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, which is an odd association to make for two people whose associates were once claiming they had single-­handedly modernised the monarchy.” On security, they suggested they would demand round-the-clock protection paid for by the public, owing to, “The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military ­service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat”.  A royal source said: “We’re witnessing a quite extraordinary turn of events. “The British people will not stand for two ­multi-millionaires demanding taxpayer funds after abandoning the country they should be serving. “The latest series of comments published on the Sussexes’ website comes across as ­extremely petulant and has caused a great deal of alarm inside the palace. “This is further evidence of Harry and Meghan further ostracising ­themselves from the family rather than building bridges.”  Harry and Meghan defied the Queen on January  by releasing a statement on Instagram announcing they were to “step back” as senior members of the royal family. They intended to move to North America and trade on their royal ­connections to make money in the corporate world, while setting up a charitable vehicle and ­carrying out small roles for the Queen – but they were told there could be no “halfway house”. The couple have spent thousands trademarking Sussex Royal items and marketing their website and Instagram page.

The Shoebox Project Foundation, a company registered in the US state of North Carolina registered the site. After reports claimed Mulroney had used her charity to claim the domain name, she tweeted a denial, writing it had no affiliations or ties to our charity The Shoebox Project. It comes after Harry and Meghan were told that they would no longer be able to use their Sussex Royal brand. Earlier this year, Andrew Myer, Meghanaposs US business manager, told the Mail on Sunday that he had registered two websites - archefoundation and archefoundation.org - just eight days after the Duchess revealed she was pregnant in October, . In September last year, he renewed the trademark of Meghanaposs now-defunct lestyle blog, The Tig. Meanwhile, their lives as working royals will end on March  when they stop representing the Queen and become financially independent. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex hit back in a long statement in which they argued that neither the Queen nor the government owned the word aposroyalapos across the world. Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said the declaration reflected how unhappy the couple were, according to Sun Online. The statementaposs underlying message is they are very, very unhappy with this arrrangment., he said. It was completely unnecessary.  If they are unhappy with this arrangement, one would hope it lasts the year until the review and hope that both sides are able to continue to co-exist in a reasonable and peaceful way. The Palace confirmed Meghan and Harry will be closing their Buckingham Palace office, meaning their  employees face the axe as the couple prepare to move their lives to North America. Harry will keep his military ranks of Major, Lieutenant Commander, and Squadron Leader but will not use them during the  month trial period. New details of when we will see the couple, who are currently in Canada with their son Archie, next have also emerged. Harry will join Jon Bon Jovi as he re-records his song ‘Unbroken’ with the Invictus Games Choir on February . On March  Meghan will join Harry to attend the Endeavour Fund Awards.

Aid worker Ziz York paid to have her two girls Nia, nine, and eight-year-old Robyn join her on a visit so they could witness real poverty. She said: “Before we went to Uganda, my daughters had been complaining ‘Oh, we’re so poor’ because they’d seen friends get holidays to Disney World or getting an Xbox for their birthdays. “I said ‘You have a roof over your head, we can buy pretty much what we want in a supermarket, you have freedom of movement, we are in the top % richest in the world’.” The girls were not convinced, pointing out they don’t have “a mansion or servants”. So their mum showed them the conditions faced by some in the East Africa nation. She said: “We do live in a suburban bubble, so Uganda was mind-blowing for them. “I think the biggest eye-opener for them was the lack of clothing.  “They were seeing children that were a quarter dressed because their clothes were that ragged. “They saw the lack of basic supplies we take for granted. “The Ugandan kids didn’t have pens, paper, underwear – a lot didn’t have shoes. There were no toys.”  Nia and Robyn did not witness the malnutrition suffered by some children in the country, or those dying from malaria, but Ziz said they saw enough to understand why Uganda needs help. She added: “I wish more British people could get that perspective.” The mum, from Inverness, works for British charity TeamsU which specialises in educating people in Uganda about sexual health.  It aims to teach girls about their periods so they are not too ashamed to go to school. Periods are seen by many there as a “curse”. One in four women have a child by the age of .

Customers were treated to a spirited tableside performance to mark the re-opening of the -seater pizzeria at The Strand: Trafalgar Square. The musical celebration included the aptly-named song aposOpening Upapos and was performed by cast members including Marisha Wallace and Evie Hoskins. Marisha, who plays Becky in the show, said: We had so much fun surprising diners with one of the showaposs most recognisable songs. The look on everyoneaposs faces when we began was amazing - Iaposd love to do it all over again. The venue has recently undergone an extensive transformation in line with the brandaposs sleek aposFutureExpressapos design look and feel, featuring a new logo, signage and unorm. The look was first unveiled at Langham Place: Oxford Circus in March , when the brand stopped traffic with the worldaposs first synchronised apospizza flareapos. It has since been trialled at more than  pizzerias in the UK and Ireland as part of what the brand has dubbed its apostest and learnapos to share the dining experience with superfans.  Zoe Bowley, managing director of PizzaExpress, said: Our sociable pizzeria aposThe Strand: Trafalgar Squareapos, is just the latest in a number of locations to be transformed to showcase our fresh aposnew-lookapos in what marks our th anniversary year. Live music and spirited performances have always been a big part of PizzaExpressapos history. So what better way to mark the occasion than by teaming up with the talented cast of the neighbouring hit West End show to deliver the ultimate surprise and aposgood times togetherapos to celebrate.  The Waitress cast were joined by six of the pizza-makeraposs resident apospizzaiolosapos, who flared dough in unison to the performance. They then descended upon Trafalgar Square to continue their celebratory performance outside, much to the delight of on-lookers and traffic who stopped in their tracks to find out what was going on. Marisha Wallace said: Our show is all about the fun of baking, and is jam-packed with songs, which are truly good enough to eat.  Even though our special surprise performance at PizzaExpress was a one off, weaposre serving fully-baked performances down the road at the Adelphi Theatre until Saturday,  July before touring the rest of the UK. Soyou missed out, why not enjoy a slice or two of the UKaposs favourite pizza before heading down the road to see our show.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have been accused of making a disrespectful snipe at the Queen in their bombshell statement. The couple shared an extraordinary post on Instagram on Friday, hinting at the tense negotiations over their the revised role once they quit the royal family. They also appear to hit out at other royals being allowed to seek outside employment. Critics have accused Harry and Meghan of aiming a swipe at the monarch in the statement, in which they said they would legally be allowed to describe themselves as aposRoyalapos overseas. Although they said they will not using their Sussex Royal branding, pointing out that they could legally continue to do so has jarred with palace insiders, according to reports. Speaking on Sky News this morning, royal biographer Angela Levin said that the Queen would be saddened by the latest statement, which she branded spiteful and petulant. The Queen didnapost want to ostracise him, Ms Levin told Kay Burley. She wrote that she loved them and wanted them to be in the family. They seem to take no notice of that, and just look for the dark side, looking at what theyaposve missed out on. One statement in the coupleaposs statement points out that other royals have been allowed to earn money through outside work - believed to be a barbed reference to Princess Eugenie and Beatrice. Harry and Meghan wrote: While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month review period has been put in place. A source told the Daily Mail: It was their decision to do this and the family is clearly trying their best to facilitate it. But it inevitably requires sacrices on both sides and the Sussexes need to be rather more gracious about it. Sniping from the sidelines doesnapost help anyone. Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams, a former Editor of International Whoaposs Who, added: It has been especially unnecessary to underline it in this way, especially as the agreement will be reviewed after a year. It simply empathises the ision that we know thataposs there. The tone theyaposve taken is that they are unhappy, theyaposve made it clear every step of the way. Reports in the US suggested Meghan had told pals there was aposnothing legally stopping themapos from using Sussex Royal despite the Queenaposs ban.  The Queen called on her senior legal advisers to outline the case enshrined in UK law banning the use of the word “royal” for financial gain, prompting their latest bombshell statement. It means they cannot use Sussex Royal on merchandising, despite having already spent thousands on doing just that on a range of goods from T-shirts to bandanas and literature.They will also have to choose a new name for their planned charitable foundation, which was due to use the label.  But in their new statement, the couple claim the Monarchy and Cabinet Office had no jurisdiction over the use of the word aposroyalapos overseas. However, the Sussexes said they no longer plan to trademark aposSussex Royalapos.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA student has laid bare the harrowing moment she was placed in a psychiatric ward after her symptoms were mistaken for a severe mental breakdown. Former Franklin College student Lucy Dawsonaposs parents were told sheaposd have to be sectioned after she started shouting her housemateaposs name, trembling and giggling manically. She experienced terrying panic attacks and at one stage her friend saw her rocking back and forth while hunched in a ball.The -year-old also tried to throw herself out of a moving car leading doctors to believe she was mentally unstable, Grimsby Live reports. Her shocked parents even asked friendsshe was taking drugs orher drinks had been spiked after one attack. But three months after being committed to a psychiatric ward, Lucy was diagnosed with Anti-NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis, a rare brain disorder. It is a serious condition in which the brain becomes inflamed. Encephalitis can be le threatening and anyone can be affected but the very young and very old are most at risk. Lucy previously laid bare her ordeal but has now spoken out again to raise awareness of her condition as this weekend marks World Encephalitis Day, celebrated annually on February . In October , Lucy became overrun by negativity, locking herself away in her bedroom and avoiding all social interactions.She began to question her capabilities – saying she was going to fail her degree and started experiencing excruciating headaches.But, unfortunately, this was only the start of Lucyaposs troubles.  She was soon experiencing confusion, loss of consciences, problems speaking and weakness. Lucy, from Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, said: My housemate and best friend, Becs, found me in the early hours of the morning shouting her name with wild eyes and trembling in my room. Becs managed to contact my mum, who advised her to call an ambulance. My mum tried to speak to me on the phone but I couldnapost speak other than repeat the same word or giggle manically. Doctors said Lucy had suffered a panic attack and sent her home  minutes later with breathing exercises. But Lucy said: The next morning everything erupted.  Becs found me again at am frantically screaming her name. I was sat bunched in a ball in the middle of my room rocking backwards and forwards. Lucyaposs parents travelled to the University of Leicester to support their daughter through another hospital visit. They asked her housemates whether she had taken any drugs or had been spiked – she had not. On her way to hospital, Lucy tried to escape a moving car, and had to be physically restrained in the waiting room.  Later on that day, doctors told Lucyaposs parents she had suffered a severe mental breakdown and needed to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act . She was admitted to a mental health unit where she began to receive treatment. I was pumped religiously with psychotic drugs for a fictional mental breakdown, said Lucy. Because of this, my brain disease was able to progress, meaning my body effectively began to shut down and die. Doctors told my mum and dad I was going to die and they didnapost know why. After a hazy three months in a psychiatric ward, the condition Anti-NMDA Receptor Autoimmune Encephalitis was raised. Lucyaposs parents were told they could sign papers for her to undergo electroshock therapy in a last-ditch attempt to save their daughter’s le. She went on to receive three rounds of electroshock therapy and her first treatment coincided with her st birthday. Lucy said: By no means is this a treatment for encephalitis and by no means should it have worked. However, by some miracle, by the third round of shocks, I began to have large seizures which somehow must have shook my brain into resetting. Lucy was placed back into her hospital in a catatonic state, meaning she couldnapost feel her body.  She said: I was left unattended on this bed. It was at this moment that I had my next seizure. I was convulsing so much I fell off the bed and onto an open radiator pipe that was directly next to it. Lucy suffered a cm third-degree burn on her left buttock. She said: I was extremely hazy for a long time after first coming around.  I vaguely remember realising my left leg and foot were not working when I tried to get out of bed. Doctors said her leless leg was a result of encephalitis and her body wasn’t fully done waking up. On top of this, Lucy was unable to speak and all her memories had vanished. She credits her grandparents for playing a remarkable role in her rehabilitation. She said: My favourite singer had always been Elvis Presley and my grandpa bought every single one of his song books and learnt to play all his songs on the keyboard in the hope I would remember them and sing along. It wasn’t until a chance appointment with a locum doctor that Lucy finally received answers about her leg. She told the doctor what had happened and said she could almost see the penny drop. Lucy said: She said my burn was directly in the same place as my sciatic nerve. She believed the burn had been so severe it had burnt through my nerve completely and killed it, thus leaving my left leg paralysed from the knee down.  Lucy said suddenly, everything started to make sense and she was able to slowly start piecing her le back together. She had put her criminology degree on hold while undergoing treatment and rehabilitation.Lucy said: I can remember watching the Facebook live video of all my coursemates walking onto the stage and collecting their graduation certicates.As tears streamed down my face, I wonderedI would ever be able to string a sentence together again, let alone write a dissertation worthy of a degree. During a tearful conversation with her sister about her future, it was suggested she focus on her passion for writing instead of worrying about her degree.Her sister, a graphic designer, set up the blog  Lucy in the Sky with Encephalitis and created a zebra logo.Lucy said: The zebra is used in teaching medical students, where they are told: aposIf you hear hoof beats, think horse, not zebraapos. This means go down the diagnosis route that seems the most obvious and don’t expect it to be a rare disease. In my case, the doctors heard hoof beats and thought mental breakdown when in fact, I was the zebra – with encephalitis.

A poll of , employed adults discovered that just under a third saw their dream of being a teacher, doctor or train driver become a reality. In fact, more than half of those polled have a job that in no way links to the career they wanted to have when they were younger. And, despite the average worker in the UK deciding what they wanted to do at the age of , many admitted they had turned their back on those dreams soon after turning . Samantha Rutter, CEO of distance learning provider Open Study College, which commissioned the research, said: As a child, many adults dreamt of having a certain career when they grew up, whether that was something they enjoyed at school, something they had seen on TV or in a film, or perhaps they aspired to take on the same job as their parents. Unfortunately, these dreams donapost always become a reality whether thataposs because people changed their mind as they grew up, the opportunity didnapost present itself, or le simply got in the way and bills needed to be paid. But, having passion for your job can be le changing, and it is never too late to try and achieve your childhood hopes and dreams. Andyou are yet to reach your career goals or have found yourself going down a dferent path to the one you really want, retraining in your spare time can help you get back on track and into that job you always dreamed of. The study also revealed some of the top careers todayaposs adults wanted when they were children, including teaching, nursing or becoming a vet. Others had dreams of working for the police, being a musician or actor, or even being a ballerina. And  per cent were convinced their future lay in being a professional footballer. Despite dreams of being a professional athlete, zookeeper or train driver, six in  adults considered their childhood job goals to be perfectly realistic. And for those who made it a reality, a third admitted they had to work in more than one field before they were successful. Some of the main reasons for having to make dferent choices to the ones they really wanted when they were younger include failing to get good enough grades , and simply not knowing where to start . However, just under a tenth believe their parents dissuaded them from following their dream career path. It also emerged  per cent of respondents regret not chasing their dream job, and a fth have attempted to re-train or completed further education to get them on the right track.  One in three also say theyaposd be happy to take a pay cut,it enabled them to work in their dream career, according to the OnePoll research. Rebecca Jane, , from Clitheroe, wanted to work in the mental health field after facing depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress since she was a young adult. Now, she is the head of a mental health charity and responsible for coming up with schemes and ideas to help those in need. She said: Iaposve had struggles with mental health for  years now. Iaposve been that person who hasnapost had anywhere to turn and hasnapost been able to access what Iaposve needed to access at the worst point in my le. Itaposs amazing to see it benefiting other people, but itaposs also amazing that I can actually see it helping. As cheesy as it sounds, it literally completes my le.

He was a flamboyant character and was the le and soul of the party, but he was also sensitive and didnapost always understand social situations.\u2028 He was very articulate and was much more comfortable socialising with adults than people his own age and I think this made him a target.\u2028 But he was a beautul person and he had a very good group of close friends.\u2028 Ms Steward said Simonaposs bullying started at primary school when other children would name call or steal his bag - but progressed to physical violence when he started secondary school.\u2028 It was relentless, she said. He couldnapost get away from it. On the day he took his own le, heaposd had a fall out. It was over something trivial, but I think it had built up inside and this was what tipped him over the edge.\u2028 Just before Simon died we had agreed to home school. He loved subjects such as design and technology and he was very inquisitive, he loved learning.\u2028 But it got to the point where he just didnapost want to go to school anymore.\u2028  Ms Steward said that while Simon was a happy teenager who was full of le, the bullying started to take its toll on his home le.\u2028 She said: He would come home from school and for the first hour or so he wasnapost himself. But then he would relax for a bit and would be back to normal.\u2028 But then by nighttime he would be tense again. He wouldnapost sleep at night. By the end, he was sleeping in my bed and his father would sleep in his.\u2028 It was the same at the weekends. On Friday evenings he would have a sudden burst of energy, it was like a switch had gone off, but then by Sunday evening he would be saying he didnapost want to go to school.\u2028 But despite all that he loved le completely. He was always the first person to volunteer to speak in front of a crowd and he was a daredevil. He loved bungee jumps and skyes and he was a real thrill seeker.\u2028 I just think that at the moment in time he didnapost know what  to do.\u2028 In the afternoon of March , , Simon skipped his last lesson of the day and made his way home early. He then took a cocktail of medication.\u2028  A suicide note written by Simon was later discovered in the house.\u2028 Ms Steward first learnt about Simonaposs overdose when she ed home hours later to find the emergency services outside.\u2028 She said: I was out with friends and I just had this sudden feeling that something bad had happened. I think Simon and I had this special connection and I just told my friends that I had to go home.\u2028 When we arrived at the house there was an ambulance outside. I ran inside and Simon was sat at the dining room table talking to paramedics.\u2028 It turned out that a friend had messaged him to ask why he hadnapost been in school and he told her what he had done.\u2028 He sent a message saying that he aposhad done itapos and that he wanted to be with God. She told her mum, who managed to find out where we lived and called the police.\u2028  When I arrived home, nobody thought it was serious. Simon was telling the paramedics about the bullying at school, saying that he had had enough - but there was no sense of urgency. We had to wait an hour for an ambulance to arrive. \u2028Nobody thought it was a big deal because he was conscious and was cooperating with the emergency services. Looking back, I wish I had dragged him into the bathroom and made him vomit.\u2028 Simon was taken to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital by ambulance at around pm on March . He was subsequently transferred to Cardfaposs University Hospital of Wales on March , where he was admitted to the intensive care unit.\u2028  Ms Steward said that Simon was lying in his hospital bed when he told her that he didnapost want to die. \u2028He didnapost want to kill himself, she said. He was telling me that he was sorry and that he wished he hadnapost done it and that heaposd been stupid.\u2028 But at this point, I still thought it was going to be ok. I thought we would get through it and that I would take him home.\u2028 It wasnapost until we were in the Heath hospital that I realised just how serious it was.

They are ­genetically changed to grow quickly and suffer a string of health ­problems. One campaigner said: “Such conditions are cruel.” But Tory George Eustice has not ruled out chlorine-washed meat being sold here post-Brexit. Crammed into an airless room with barely any space and ­covered in sores, these chickens spend their pitul seven weeks on earth in silent horror. The end finally comes when their throats are slit at a slaughterhouse before they are machine-plucked and washed in chlorine. I hold one at less than eight weeks old in my hand as its heart pounds in its chest and I am told that thanks to engineered genetics to make them grow quicker,it were a human it would weigh st.  Welcome to the poultry capital of the world, where America’s ravenous appetite for controversial reared chickens is set to take flight across the AtlanticDonald Trump gets his way in a UK-US trade deal.For  years, chlorine-washed US chickens have been banned in the EU over fears it masks poor hygiene standards. But post-Brexit, American poultry producers insist we accept their lower welfare conditions as part of any new tie-up. Today, the Mirror reports from inside the highly secretive industry. One farmer, who rears birds for a major US supplier, took us to his shed at Gainesville, Georgia, to see first hand what is known in these parts as “white gold”. Stepping inside, I was hit by the overpowering smell of faeces and ammonia. The stench from the two-inch deep layer of excrement was so overpowering I had to cover my mouth and nose. Anyone would expect a crescendo of noise from what lives inside. There must have been more than , chickens sitting on the floor in front of me – but all were silent. They didn’t move. Or cluck. Other than those around the corn feeders, most appeared like statues, living in almost complete darkness. Allowed to pick one up, most shocking was its bloated stomach. Like all the others, it had lost its feathers, exposing red raw flesh.  The whole underside of almost every chicken appeared like an unbroken bedsore. Because of their abnormally accelerated weight gain some don’t even make it to slaughter, dying of heart attacks and collapsed lungs. Poultry Science Journal has ­calculated thathumans grew at the same rate as these modern chickens, they would weigh  stone by eight weeks. The noxious compound of nitrogen and hydrogen emitted by the birds can also make them go blind. Driving through the hilly ­farmlands on the outskirts of Gainesville there are times where you can see virtually nothing but series of low pitch-roofed sheds, each about  yards long. We arrived hoping to speak to farmers and paymasters about the industry. But very quickly it became apparent all were under a strict omerta that they dare not break or ­livelihoods would be lost and contracts ripped apart.  One farmer, who asked not to be named, told us: “The whole industry is run like a cartel by the big ­companies. Break the rules and you are dead to them. You’re gone. The poultry manufacturers provide everything… the birds, the feed, the antibiotics, the whole nine yards. “All we are now are landlords renting out our sheds for their tenants seven weeks at a time. “One wrong move though and you’re gone. It’s like dealing with the mafia. Their websites may say they care about animal welfare but their chief concern is profit.” Humane Society International’s Dr Sara Shields said: “Consumers are right to be concerned about importing US chickens. They are crowded together in barren, dark sheds. Under industry standards, each bird lives in a space equivalent in size to A paper. “Crowding can result in higher ammonia levels, skin irritation from wet litter, and scabs and scratches on the backs of birds from climbing over one another in such crowded space.”  Geneticists began breeding dferent chickens for faster growth in . A mix of the two most successful created the Arbor Acre bird. At the same age, the new breed had grown to four times as heavy as the ­original one. The farmer who granted us access to his shed defended the way poultry is raised for meat in the US. Because his birds were two days away from being slaughtered their meat would not be infected with viruses, which takes longer to ­incubate. He said: “The chickens have a short le, but they have space to walk around. I think the conditions are fair. “We are here to raise birds. To have thousands walking freely around a farm would make it ­impossible to fulfil what the markets needs. This is the next best thing.” The Mirror approached several companies to see the ­conditions inside and the chlorine-washing they operate. Three failed to respond.  Fieldale Farms ­president Tom Hensley rejected our request but said of the facilities: “They are spotless. It’s ­[chlorine wash] safe. ­Otherwise,  million Americans would be sick every week.” Britain produces about % of the chicken consumed here. But we also import , tons a year. Ex-International Trade ­Secretary Liam Fox has insisted there is “no health reasons why you couldn’t eat chickens washed in ­chlorine”. But some experts insist the chemical may not kill all bacteria present, such as salmonella. There has been ­criticism about the rise of similar ­mega-farms in Britain. But Cardf politan University senior lecturer in food science Simon Dawson said: “In the US, the hygiene standards are not as rigid as in the EU. Incorporating a ­disinfection spray wash is designed to remove ­pathogenic bacteria. We have worked tirelessly to improve hygiene and welfare ­standards of poultry.” A  study estimated there were about , UK cases of ­salmonella food poisoning a year, or  per , people. One in the US in  found there were just over a million cases annually, about  per ,. Cheap meat is killing workers  It is impossible to rear eight billion chickens a year in the imagined rural farming system most Americans still like to hold in their mind’s eye. Not only do consumers want more meat, more importantly, they want it cheap, and demand is squeezing the industry’s , family farmers. Those feeling the pressure most are process workers – % of whom have no legal right to be in the States. An Oxfam America report in  said supervisors routinely denied employee requests to go to the bathroom. One worker said: “I and many, many others had to wear Pampers.” The local Fieldale factories employ around , people. One plant has a big banner shouting “Think Safe, Work Safe” but in recent years, according to federal safety records, it has been the site of several accidents which have led to amputations and death. One El Salvadoran worker said: “There are hazards everywhere. Typically we are tasked to perform one action over and over again, surrounded by chemicals and rotating blades.” Chlorine and other chemicals used led to the most dramatic examples including a death. Government health inspector Jose Naro died in  from lung damage related to the chemicals used in a processing plant. A government investigation highlighted a rise in the use of toxic, bacteria-killing chemicals. But Agriculture Department inspectors find factories are turning to them more. MPs have beef as Eustice refuses to rule out new laws  Environment Secretary George Eustice refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US in a post-Brexit trade deal yesterday. He said it was illegal to sell such products and there were “no plans” to change the law – but three times he refused to rule it out. “We’re absolutely clear as a Government we will not take risks either without food standards and when it comes to animal welfare we will be projecting our views on the international stage,” he said. He said “lactic acid washes” are used more in the States than chlorine, adding: “We won’t make any moves on our standards.” Lib Dem food spokesman Tim Farron said: “They are wilfully threatening British consumers and farmers.” Labour’s Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard said: “Chlorinated chicken being sold in Britain is a genuine risk, unless this backdoor to lower standard US goods imports is closed and a ban is put into law.”QA What is chlorine-washed chicken  American farms are allowed to wash or dip carcasses in water containing chlorine dioxide to kill harmful organisms such as E.coli, salmonella, and campylobacter on the outside of the meat. Why was chlorine-washing banned in the EU in   The EU maintains relying on a chlorine rinse at the end of the meat production process could be a way of compensating for poor hygiene standards – such as dirty rearing sheds or crowded abattoirs. It believes the ban leads to higher standards of hygiene and welfare at each stage. Do we get any chlorine-washed chicken from the States  The ban has stopped virtually all imports of US chicken meat treated by this process. Americans argue the ban is simply a way to create a trade barrier.

Brett said the office where he worked as a printing machinist never minded his tattoos and parents at his -year-old son Michaelaposs school didnapost give him a second glance.  He had made up his mind to get his head covered seven years ago but Dorothy was adamant she wouldnapost allow it because she worried he wouldnapost be able to sustain a job.But after a year she relented and within just a handful of sessions he was unrecognisable - and then started running a nail salon from his home. His -year-old son was never interested in tattoos as a youth but has since had a full sleeve, while his daughter Anamae, , is undecided. Brett said some people do oggle him but he sees his body art as a way to express his iniduality and he enjoys the attention.

Dust clouds stretching hundreds of miles moved across the countryaposs Canary Islands yesterday - grounding as many as  flights and causing  planes to be erted. Many Brits were left stranded at airports across the islands, with some ing from half-term breaks. Flights from Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, North and South Tenere Airports have been grounded due to the weather conditions.  Flights from the UK were also grounded or cancelled, due to the sandstorm. Have you been affected by the sandstorm  Email webnews@mirror In one aerial image, the storm can be seen stretching across the ocean from the Moroccan coast before reaching the Canary Islands. Other images showed runways at airports across the islands shrouded in dust, with many travellers wearing masks to help with their breating. Greg Horsman, , was on holiday with his girlfriend and his friends on a Tui cruise and was due to fly home to Manchester on Saturday evening, reports the Daily Mail. They have now been forced to stay in Gran Canaria for another two nights. Greg said: Itaposs frustrating. Weaposre just ready to be home. Last night we were in the airport for five hours and I was frustrated because Tui couldnapost help us or do anything until the airport declared that they were closed which they did at .pm. Other Brits posted images of orange skies causing poor visibility. Michael Nixon, on holiday with his family in Tenere, was left stranded after being due tohome to Newcastle. He said it was all a bit surreal as they woke to a yellowish haze and strong winds. Unlucky Tim Crew, , had booked a holiday to Lanzarote after the family cancelled their original holiday to Hong Kong and Thailand over coronavirus worries. He said it was just one of those things really. Shipping traffic has also been suspended around the islands and authorities in some parts have issued a red alert for people to stay indoors - especially those with respiratory problems. Further disruption in Tenere and Gran Canaria was also being caused by a number of fires which have broke out. The Canary president said: We are under the influence of four phenomena with the alert for strong winds, the calima, coastal phenomena and forest fires. All the mechanisms required by the protocol have been activated. We have had fires in Gran Canaria in two municipalities and in six municipalities in Tenere.

Initially we were talking about £. million to get everything up and running but we’ve managed to do it on a shoestring budget and do things in stages.“The first stage was the xm astroturf to give clubs the opportunity to play and get affiliated with Dundee East. That grew very quickly and then we moved onto a full-sized pitch.“We want a full stadium as well with changing facilities, physio and boot rooms, and add on some post-match hospitality or event space.“The idea was to get the pitch up and running first and use the revenue from that to move to the next stage.“Over the next few years we are hoping to continue expanding the ground by investing, hopefully, in a proper pavilion.“We have a stand going up in the next two or three weeks and we will, hopefully, have the old Douglas Lads building next to the ground brought up to standard.” vw, px\"  He added: “The hub is for the whole community.“When I was younger I used to play football where the skate factory is now in Douglas and that’s not there anymore.“There are less and less places for kids to play football and we want to keep them off the streets, teach them people skills and give a good, safe environment to play sport.“That’s exactly what it’s done.“Since the full-size park has been finished, along with the # astro, over  kids are playing every single week. That’s fantastic.“From my point of view, driving home every evening and seeing the lights on and kids playing football gives a huge sense of satisfaction.“The good thing is the money that has been put in here will be here for a long, long time – everything generated goes straight back into it.“I’m very passionate and seeing things come through as part of the committee is fantastic.“We have a long, long way to go but the hope is we have the pathway from four-years-old right through to the adults. Hopefully, in time we see kids coming through the juveniles into the amateurs, maybe to the juniors, and possibly to the seniors.” vw, px\"  Deuchars, whose background is in engineering, will be known to Dundee United fans for his former company GA Engineering for their sponsorship of Gussie Park and the help he has given the club over the years.He added: “I have put money into Dundee United but I like to focus on grassroots. If I put £ million into United, it would be there for one season but I do that into a community club it is there for a letime and is le-changing for a lot of kids who want to play football.”It’s not been all plain sailing, however. He added: “There have a few teething issues but they have all been addressed. We’ve spoken to local residents as well as MSPs and councillors to resolve the issues.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.48090067-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.48090067-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.48090067-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.48090067-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"music legend paul weller to play gig at dundees caird hall this year","story":"Music legend Paul Weller is to play a show in Dundee, it has been announced today.Dundee is famous for Jute, Jam and Journalism, and the frontman of the iconic #s band The Jam will appear at the city#s Caird Hall in November.With his recently announced  May tour already sold out, the former Style Council singer gets back on the road in October and November to play a further  dates across the UK and Ireland.As well as the Dundee concert, Weller will also be appearing at Edinburgh#s Usher Hall.\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed KJIbaIpwvA featureoembed#enablejsapi#originhttps:wpcluster.dctdigital\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenThe Dundee gig takes place on November .His new album On Sunset will be released on June  # Weller#s first release for his new label Polydor.The singer songwriter, , achieved fame with rockers The Jam from  to , then with the Style Council from  to .He established himself as a solo artist in , with his  album Stanley Road often listed as one of the greatest British records of all time.Tickets for the gig go on general sale at am on Friday , via Dundee Box Office.For details of a special fan pre-sale, head to the official Paul Weller website."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/DNic_Tele_Fball_Podcast-8-scaled-e1582122918392-940x547.jpg ","title":"queen of the south 0 1 dundee forster strike sees dark blues move back into play off spots","story":"Dundee moved level with second-placed Inverness in the Championship after a hard-fought - win at Queen of the South.The Dark Blues dominated much of the contest at a windswept Palmerston but it took until the nd minute to break the deadlock as Jordon Forster powered in from close range.Dundee boss James McPake stuck with the set-up that worked so well against Partick, though he was forced into one change as Andrew Nelson replaced the injured Ross Callachan.

We are building towards next season already as well.“As long as the strikers stay fit.“There are always ‘what-s’ but we have Andrew Nelson back and Paul McGowan can play up there when he needs to.“Strength-wise I do think we are better now than we were going into the Partick game as a squad.

But you can only be influential as a front twoeverybody  is doing their bit behind it.“It was -- v -- in the second half and in extra-time. There is a trade off there because although we had more attacking threat we had less control of the game.“Kilmarnock could have picked us off at times on the counter-attack, but that’s the trade off. And I do think there are times when the two can play up front together.”Cosgrove has been on the bench for Aberdeen’s last three outings following a dip in form after the Premiership’s winter break.But on Wednesday night in Ayrshire the English hitman was back among the goals, netting his nd of the season from the penalty spot in extra time.McInnes was delighted with the -year-old nerves to dispatch the spot-kick and hopes that strike can boost Cosgrove’s confidence and lead to more goals in the weeks to come.The Premiership’s longest serving manager added: “Looking back now it’s almost forgotten that it was a penalty with huge pressure on it.“In Sam’s mind when he steps up he’s thinkinghe misses then we’re out of the cup.“But he didn’t and good on him.

Shay Logan was back in on the right of a four-man defence.Youngster Dean Campbell paired Lewis Ferguson in central midfield.Relegated to the bench were winger Matty Kennedy, who’d started every game since joining from St Johnstone last month, and middle-man Dylan McGeouch. Summer signing Craig Bryson was absent entirely, once more injured – this time with a groin strain.It took until  minutes for the first effort on goal at windy Pittodrie to arrive, Don Cowie fizzing a low long-range effort by the left post.Soon after Niall McGinn curled a free-kick over Ross Laidlaw’s goal from  yards.On  minutes, Campbell was booked for blocking off Josh Mullin, before the Dons won the ball back and Cosgrove – fed by partner Main – pulled a shot across goal from  yards.As the home side started to click into gear, Callum Morris was the second man in referee Gavin Duncan’s notebook, chopping down Cosgrove has he drove forward with the ball.Aberdeen went in front on  minutes. After a McGinn-Campbell corner routine which saw the teenager swing the ball in left-footed and Liam Fontaine fail to deal with the delivery at the front post, Cosgrove nodded down to Main to finish from close range.Just as Pittodrie was thinking “here we go”, Campbell was dismissed by the referee, earning a cheap second booking for not being far enough back at a County free-kick.This meant goalscorer Main was forced to fill the void in the middle of the park by dropping back.The high from the goal had faded, however, the Dons still had the next big opening, with Cosgrove stopped by the sliding Laidlaw at the edge of his box after a great run and through-ball from Connor McLennan. Main then ballooned a second bite at getting a shot away over from distance.County equalised with two minutes of the half to play, Billy Mckay heading ex-Red Richard Foster’s cross beyond Joe Lewis.After the break, the visitors would’ve been in front but for Joe Lewis, with the keeper rushing out to close down Billy Mckay after Scott McKenna played a woeful blind back pass.Lewis then denied Erwin with his foot on the follow-up.Moments later, Lewis Ferguson’s raking effort from  yards hit the Staggies’ left post and Laidlaw done very well to tip away McGinn’s attempt to find the far top corner on the rebound.There followed a period where both sides struggled to create much of note in the final third.The Staggies undoubtedly had the better opportunities of the second period, however.And, with less than  minutes left, Lewis made a fantastic save after Mullin’s effort from the edge of the box was deflected towards the top left corner of the Aberdeen goal.On  minutes, the visitors got their winner. Mckay firing low from the left side of the box into the far corner after an incisive ball through the middle of McKenna and Taylor."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters the future for organ donation","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPresently around , people in the UK are waiting for organ transplantation. All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

The charity works hand in hand with some of the poorest communities in Madagascar to improve their lives and their environment.By addressing people#s primary needs, such as health, sanitation and agriculture, the charity allows them to focus on longer-term challenges, like education, legal tenure and livelihoods. In the process the charity not only saves lives and improves community health, food security, education and prosperity, it also encourages and enables people to look after the forests on which they depend. So far, over , hectares of forest, fauna and flora has been protected.Taking part in the , mile unsupported rowing race across the Atlantic Ocean, the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, the Maclean brothers were setting out to raise £, for two good causes – Argyll charity Feedback Madagascar and Children st.Facing wind, rain, huge waves, fatigue and battery problems, the brothers rowed day and night, repeating shts of two hours of rowing and one hour of rest.One and a half million oar strokes later, they completed the gruelling challenge in an incredible  days  hours and  minutes, winning the trio class and placing third overall. And setting three world records in the process they are the first three brothers to row any ocean, the fastest trio to row across the Atlantic and the youngest trio to row across the Atlantic.In the time it took the brave Maclean brothers to row the Atlantic, Feedback Madagascar was able to undertake their feasibility study for the first BROARhole in Andranomena and begin the project.Breaking ground on the first BROARhole, Jamie Spencer said: #The MacLean brothers have raised so much awareness for Feedback Madagascar since their record-breaking Atlantic row.

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian

Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built

to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"waterside-bistro-chief-takes-castle-inn-dirleton","story":"Brothers Jack and James Findlay have been at the helm of the Waterside Bistro, next to the River Tyne in Haddington, for more than two-and-a-half years.The eaterie was founded by their dad Jim, who also previously ran The Drovers Inn in East Linton, and The Rocks on Dunbarrsquos Marine Road.Now, Jack is expanding the empire by taking over The Castle Inn.He told the Courier: ldquoWe have had quite a soft opening, we just opened yesterday [last Wednesday].ldquoI think the area is lovely and my dad was born in Dirleton, so there is a little bit of heritage there.ldquoWe will be basing it a lot on the Waterside model and obviously myself and my brother will be working alongside each other but from afar.ldquoWe have had tremendous success at the Waterside and we both felt it was probably the right time to look where.ldquoThe Castle Inn was the perfect fit for us.ldquoIt will be myself here and my brother is still based in Haddington.ldquoMy dad is lsquoretiredrsquo but will just be popping in and making sure we are going in the right direction.Twenty-eight-year-old Jack said they already had a good team in place and there were no plans for any ldquodrastic changes.A focus would be placed on locally sourced food, with a daily list of specials.He added: ldquoI would also like to mention the former owners John Dawson and Bert DrsquoAgostino, and want to pay a bit of a tribute to them for their fine work in the trade.ldquoJohn has been fantastic with me and very helpful."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality.

Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence.

Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant.

Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age. What baffles women is why, with such a simple formula for success ndash unlike the minefield of female fashion ndash there are still so many men dressing badly."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11058549.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tee-off-scotlands-unique-golf-courses","story":"BELLSHILL GOLF CLUBBellshill Golf Course is situated in the heart of Lanarkshire overlooking Strathclyde Park.

Terns are known to be highly iable in breeding numbers and it is too early to saythis trend is going to continue.Scotlandrsquos breeding seabirds are of international importance. A total of  species of seabird regularly breed in Scotland and they are not only vulnerable to changes in the countryrsquos seas.Many migrate across the Atlantic and technology is beginning to improve scientistsrsquo understanding of their movements.A UK wide seabird census is currently underway and the results from this will help to provide an overview on all of the species of seabirds breeding around Scotland.Offering grounds for hope, Mr Foster said that puffins, one of the countryrsquos most popular marine species, were among the biggest winners after the eradication of predators.He also highlighted early signs that populations of wading birds have received a boost following the removal of mink.ldquoOn the islands where eradications have happened, we are seeing population increases for some species, he said.ldquoPrimarily its the chicks and eggs they predate on but for birds that burrow, like puffins, they predate the adults as well.ldquoWe have seen increases for puffins on the Shiants and also big increases for puffins on Canna after the removal of rats.ldquoAmerican mink have also been an issue, particularly on the islands around Argyll and the west coast, but there are efforts ongoing to remove mink from these places.ldquoWhere mink have been removed in local areas, we are seeing some improvements, not only with seabirds but with waders as well."},{"url":null,"title":"calls-rural-pilot-scheme-go-ahead-catastrophic-immigration-policy-announcement","story":"As revealed earlier this week, the UK is set to bring in a raft of new restrictions for migrants looking to work in the country, with those classed as low-skilled being given little opportunity to enter.Experts claimed Scotland would be worst hit, due to the demographic need for migrants to boost population growth and the employment challenges in rural areas.Westminsters own Migration Advisory Committeerecommended that a rural pilot scheme be introduced for parts of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to ensure migrants could still work in areas which \"face more complex challenges in recruitment and retention of workers.The report released last month stated: \"There should be a separate pilot visa for lsquoremotersquo areas of the UK, part of which could be lower salary thresholds for migrants into those areas. This should only be done with a full evaluation to understand its effectiveness and impacts.However in the policy revealed on Tuesday by Priti Patel, no mention of the scheme was made, prompting concern from Scottish business owners and politicians that it may not happen at all.The Scottish Government said it was deeply concerned that the proposals have not been mentioned since they were recommended by MAC, and demanded Westminster seriously consider its suggestions of implementing a Scottish visa.Some in the hospitality, tourism and agriculture sectors have already told of how the plans would cripple their businesses, with some firms employing % of their workers who are not from the UK.Home Secretary Patel said thatbusinesses foresee problems with the plan, they should automate their processes or find a dferent way of working, promoting further outcry up and down the country.The Scottish Governments Migration Minister Ben Macpherson has today reiterated the calls for a rural pilot scheme, and has urged Boris Johnsons Government to ensure it is in the policy before changes take effect in January .He said: \"The Scottish Government and many others across the business community and the third sector have made it unequivocally clear to the UK Government that their immigration plans would deeply damage Scotlandrsquos economic, social and demographic prosperity.ldquoThe proposals would be catastrophic for rural areas, which are particularly dependent on migration to sustain local communities and public services, so it is deeply worrying that the UK Government does not appear to mention anywhere in these latest proposals their own prior commitment to running rural migration pilots.ldquoThe Scottish Government put forward a clear, workable proposal for devolving immigration powers and introducing a Scottish visa, which would allow Scotland to attract and retain people with the skills and attributes we need for all our communities and economy to flourish.ldquoThe UK Government must now seriously engage with these proposals, which have widespread support across Scotland.A Home Office spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there were several elements of the policy on immigration still being discussed, with further announcements to be made in the coming months.They could not confirmthe rural pilot schemes would be part of these announcements, but said that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would overly complicate the immigration system and cause signicant dficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff across the UK.A spokeswoman said: \"The UK points-based immigration system will work in the interests of the whole country ndash Scotland included.ldquoIt will attract the brightest and the best from around the globe, boost the economy and our communities as well as ending free movement bringing overall migration numbers down."},{"url":null,"title":"living-caves-moving-primarily-night-40-years-david-pratt-afghanistan","story":"Pratt observes: ldquoItrsquos  years that country has been at war. There are kids that I was with in the early s whotheyrsquore still alive will not have known one day of peace. Anwarirsquos son is -ish and hersquos never known it. It was the th anniversary of the Soviet invasion on Christmas day. ##Readers of this paper, The Herald on Sunday, The Herald and the former Sunday Herald will be familiar with Prattrsquos extraordinary photojournalism and reports from war-torn parts of the world ndash Iraq, Gaza, Syria, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Bosnia.The title of a recent exhibition of his photographs, Only With The Heart, was taken from a quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupery: ldquoIt is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.There are few journalists with more heart, or more commitment to the stories they report on. The focus of this first documentary about his work is Afghanistan because itrsquos a country he has been visiting for over four decades. Itrsquos where a piece of his heart is. ##The idea, he tells says, of reporting from Afghanistan first entered his imagination when he was lying in a bed in a hospital in Nicaragua, feverish with malaria, after he had gone out there, just out of art school, to cover the revolution.As he suffered in the stling heat, he came across a copy of National Geographic with Steve McCurryrsquos iconic image of a young Afghan woman on the cover.ldquoI flicked through and I remember the pictures were of snowy mountains in Afghanistan ndash and I was sweltering in this hospital from malaria and, God, it looked so inviting almost by contrast, he recalls. ##Pratt wasnrsquot a stereotypical war reporter from a privileged background. He was a working-class boy who had grown up in the Hillhouse scheme near Hamilton, which, he says, they used to call ldquoBeirut or Hellhouse. The first time he was ever shot at, he describes, was in the street there, when he was seven years old and someone ldquotook a pot shot at the postman who had failed to deliver his giro benefit cheque, and he happened to be walking nearby.##His background is one of the things that makes his early trips all the more remarkable. ldquoWorking-class people were not meant to do what I was doing, he says. ldquoEvery foreign correspondent at that time was middle or upper class. There were times when I didnrsquot have the #price of a tube fare to come in from my flat in the southside of Glasgow for meetings in the city centre, but I was planning to go to Afghanistan in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoYou would beg, borrow and steal to get the money to get to these places. I feltI ended up getting clobbered in Afghanistan at least theyrsquore not going to come looking for my overdraft. There was a degree of fate about it.##Pratt was looking out at the world at a particular political moment ndash the early s, following the revolution in Nicaragua, the Iranian revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, all of which had taken place in . ldquoAfghanistan wasnrsquot really known at that time, he recalls. ldquoIt was still an obscure backwater. The only thing yoursquod read about it was the hippy trail. But the politics of the region werenrsquot known.ldquoThe religious aspect of it was misunderstood. A lot of the mujahideen groups were Islamist, but they werenrsquot absolutely rabid fundamentalists like the Taliban. They just didnrsquot like the bloody Russians. And can you blame them ##Pratt didnrsquot head out there looking for a specic story ndash though he had an interest in guerrilla movements and underdogs. ldquoI wasnrsquot looking at the grand politics of things, he says. ldquoI was very interested in how people lived. Although the irony is that by the stage I went to Afghanistan, I was very left-wing. I was actually a card-carrying member of the communist party.ldquoIf the mujahideen had known I was a communist it would have been curtains. They wouldnrsquot have waited to find out that I was interested in the notion of resistance and guerrilla movements.##His route into Afghanistan involved illegally crossing the border from Pakistan. The way Pratt tells it, it sounds like after a small amount of research. He flew to Peshawar on a wing and a prayer ndash with few connections. ldquoAfghanaid was my first port of call in Peshawar and they kind of sent me in the direction of one or two mujahideen, but I had to make those approaches myself.##What strikes you almost immediately is how risky his forays into Afghanistan were. He travelled with small groups of mujahideen, slept in caves, moved at night, and, when he fell ill, which he did, would have to be smuggled back out of the country. Often the groups he was with were making -hour marches through the Hindu Kush.He was also highly dependent on the mujahideen guerrillas who took him into the country, people like Sayed Anwari, with whom he formed a close friendship. ldquoWithout them, it would have been impossible. I went back and forward across the border in all these dferent guises. I got caught dressed as a woman in a burka. I went in a coffin, behind grain sacks. Anwari would organise these elaborate ways of getting in and out. I was completely dependent on them.##His le was at risk on countless occasions. In the film, he describes one occasion when he and the group he was with had to beat a retreat from mortar bombardment. ldquoRounds were landing all around you ndash people were going into the air, pieces of them coming off, body parts everywhere.As he and the others around him ran, he passed a man whose knee had been blown off. The man put his hand out asto ask for help, but shells were still landing all around him and he had to run on. ldquoThere is a kind of guilt about that, Pratt says in the film.##You canrsquot help but wonder what his parents and friends must have been thinking. In those times,you travelled in remote areas, you were essentially dropping off the map, cutting all connection with home. ldquoThere were no mobile phones, he says. ldquoThere was no contact. Some of the trips were months on end, and you would cross the border illegally into Afghanistan and disappear off the radar. I might never have come back. ##His parents however, were already used to these disappearances. At  years old, already a keen mountaineer, he was hitchhiking to Glencoe, sleeping under bridges and tackling serious rock-climbing routes. ldquoI was already doing that, so the idea of prolonged absences was no shock to my parents, he says.##The assumption when he was growing up had always been that he would join the military. ldquoIt was a very male-dominated family, says Pratt. ldquoMy uncles were in the military. My father had done his national service in the Middle East. That upbringing instilled in him ldquoan urge to see the world. He goes on: ldquoThe military may have been a way of doing that, but in the end I got really politically opposed to things military. ##Instead he did ldquothe polar opposite and went to Glasgow School of Art, and that was where his journey towards documentary photography began. ldquoSome of my close student friends could see my increasing interest in documentary work. They were seeing a drt towards the political and the fact that a painting was too contemplative for me. The camera was a more immediate tool.##Pratt made scores of trips into Afghanistan during the s. Some were for only two or three days, but his longest was for over three months.What does he think he learned in those early years ldquoIt was mostly finding out about myself, he says. ldquoIt was physically and psychologically very hard. I was on my own. You would be three months in the mountains. My interpreter was a young engineering student from Kabul University who did not want to be a guerilla and didnrsquot want to be hoofing over the Hindu Kush mountains, so when he was given the task by Anwari he actually loathed me because Irsquod got him into this situation. We became great friends. So those long hikes over the mountains were finding out about ourselves.##Pratt kept going back to Afghanistan even after the Soviet withdrawal in . ldquoFrom the s, the mujahideen were bickering among themselves, he recalls. ldquoIt was horrendous and the West was not really interested. I was determined to cover it simply because it wasnrsquot getting covered. No-one was interested now it was Afghans fighting Afghans, not Afghans fighting the Communists any more.##Afghanistan remains war-torn, a precarious and unstable democracy. What happens there is little talked about in the West ndash a recent New York Times editorial described it as ldquoThe Unspeakable War. Meanwhile, the Taliban wages violence and controls many parts of the country.In the documentary, Pratt talks with a Taliban leader by telephone, and is told that peace will only be possible in Afghanistanthe barriers to it are lted ndash and that this would ldquorequire all foreign troops to leave Afghanistan. In recent days that possibility has come closer with the announcement from the Taliban that they are on the threshold of a historic agreement with the USA which would involve withdrawal of troops.##During his film, Pratt s to many of the frontlines from which he reported. The zoo, the site of his startling  image of a sheep wandering across a background of rubble and armoured tank, now feels like a bustling attraction in any city. But, he says, Kabul remains a scary place. When his documentary team visited the Puli Mahmood Kahn district, another former frontline, they were told by their security officers that people up the street were making calls on their mobile phones.ldquoThat area is Taliban central. We bundled into the car and shot off. We had to get up the street and we did a right on to the main highway and the security guy told the driver to do a complete U-turn in the middle of the street and then go back the other way because otherwise the Taliban could ambush us further on. Yoursquore living with that all the time in Kabul.##Pratt went on to cover conflicts in many other parts of the world. The longer he went out for, he says, the harder it would be to adjust. ldquoAfter I was kidnapped in Bosnia, I went to ground for about six months.He also found it hard sometimes to be sympathetic when people back home were stuck on petty concerns.ldquoI remember coming back from Nicaragua, says Pratt. ldquoI was really quite sick and there was a woman on the last leg from Madrid to London and all she went on about was whether the driver she had would be waiting for her at Heathrow airport. Three days earlier Irsquod been in a refugee camp and Irsquod watched them put a machine gun in an adjacent area and fire on the refugees in the camp. Itrsquos dficult not to get angry. But peoplersquos problems are relative. ##For Pratt, the process of making the documentary has been ldquocathartic. The story it tells is of world events, but also his own le. Part of it happens back home, in Glasgow, with his partner, Caron, who has stuck with him through his repeated disappearances ndash a fact he says is ldquoamazing. Recently, he says, he overheard Caron talking about how miserable he was because he was waiting for a visa to go out to Iraq. If hersquos not there when something is happening, she observes, hersquos always miserable.ldquoI remember talking to Marie Colvin about that, he says. ldquoMarie was the worstsomething was happening where. Even when she was on a job she was thinking of the next job. Anditrsquos a part of the world yoursquore really familiar with ndash Afghanistan or Israel-Palestine ndash itrsquos twice as bad. ##Did he ever think about doing anything   ldquoNot really.

As a consumer, a viewer, a punter, a critic, does the BBC mean much to you any more  Long gone are the days when the BBC was basically all we had and so by default was the centre of cultural le. Wersquore media-rich now, and time-poor.When you weigh the BBC, and judge it, does the broadcaster ndash as its founder Lord Reith promised it would do ndash still ldquoinform, educate and entertain you  Andit does, is the BBC doing it better than its many rivals Our crowded broadcasting landscape means therersquos no longer a place for BBC exceptionalism. It has to earn its place like everyone . Among  to -year-olds, the BBC struggles to remain relevant. Less than half of that key demographic watch it, boding ill for the future.The BBCrsquos back is against the wall. In our increasingly ided society, people of all political persuasions believe the channel is partisan. The left and right both hate it. Hardline Scottish nationalists and hardline Brexiters detest the BBC ndash itrsquos either part of a treacherous pro-union conspiracy, or in league with Brussels.After the criticism Boris Johnson rightly got for dodging tough interviews during the General Election, the Prime Minister seems ready to come for the BBCrsquos licence fee now. Therersquos speculation about it being replaced with an opt-in subscription model like Netflix.Of course, given that this is Britain in , the debate around the BBCrsquos future will degenerate into yet another front in our endless culture wars and produce much heat but little light ndash like a s TV set.One side will say that any threat to the BBC will see Britainrsquos media landscape turn American, with right-wing propagandists fronting channels like Fox News. The other side will say the BBC is unfairly propped up by taxpayers to the detriment of other media outlets, skewing British cultural le.The future of the BBC will be determined on purely political grounds ndash which is very strange. The BBC must be the only media institution in any democracy which is judged by a political yardstick. Everything  in the media landscape ndash radio, print, cinema, TV, online ndash is judged on much more simple criteria: do people like it and are they happy to pay for it So letrsquos judge the BBC on purely critical grounds. Letrsquos set aside the political wrangle ndash and letrsquos address this central question:the broadcaster vanished tomorrow, would you care in terms of the value and entertainment it brings you As the screw began tightening on the BBC, Irsquove started to monitor my own consumption of its programming. I wanted to see just how important it was in my le. Would I be happy without it I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the BBC plays a much smaller role in my le than I thought. Full disclosure: Irsquove worked for the BBC, and Irsquom also one of those liberal types who has spoken of the BBC as an essential pillar of British le. So, I thought when I began studying my own viewing and listening habits, that given my background the BBC would be both the journalistic and entertainment mainstay of my le. Itrsquos not.My household is media-hungry. We take nearly every TV service there is: terrestrial TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky TV, Apple TV. Wersquove got Alexas in most rooms so we can listen to radio. The house is filled with books, newspapers and magazines. Wersquore happy to pay for media.However, the question is then raised: am I happy with the way Irsquom required to pay for the BBC, compared to how I pay for other media  Would the public be better servedwe could choose the parts of the BBC we wish to pay for These questions come increasingly into focus for me as I find the BBC taking up an ever diminishing sliver of my le. The same seems to be true for many other members of the public.Just look at whatrsquos happening with the BBCrsquos news channel. Of all the services the corporation provides, this is the one I most respect. Itrsquos dependable, impartial, informative. However, like the BBCrsquos drama and comedy output, which is threatened by both homegrown competitors Channel  and international media such as Netflix, the news service is under pressure from viewers consuming current affairs online via sites like Facebook.The reach of the BBC News channel is declining. In the second quarter of , it had  million viewers. Five years previously, there were  million.When it comes to the most popular TV channel, as of September , it was Channel  with a % positivity rating. BBC was second with %, then ITV with %.I find myself agreeing with the public. Itrsquos been a long time since Irsquove watched the BBCrsquos Six OrsquoClock News. I wait for Channel  news at pm. Itrsquos smarter, more international, more in-depth. If I had to pick the channel I get most value from itrsquos Channel . But Channel  isnrsquot put on a pedestal. It provides public service broadcasting and itrsquos commercially self-funded.Irsquod certainly miss BBC Newsnight, in particular the reporting of Emily Maitlis, televisionrsquos best journalist. As to the rest of BBC TVrsquos news and current affairs therersquos not much I couldnrsquot live without. Irsquod certainly survive without the clickbait of Question Time. In Scotland, STVrsquos Scottish news is as good,not better, than BBC Scotland.Radio is a dferent matter. Irsquom very fond of BBC radio. I love Radio  music, I like a bit of Radio rsquos Jo Whiley in the background when Irsquove chores to do, and Irsquom a Radio  fan. One programme Irsquod really miss is Radio rsquos In Our Time with Melvyn Bragg ndash the best and cleverest talk show ever made, I reckon. If the BBC vanished, though, could I happily survive on podcasts and commercial radio, which I find myself increasingly listening to  Probably.The one part of the BBC Irsquod hate to lose is BBC Four. Its documentary output is excellent. From populist history shows fronted by Lucy Worsley and the channelrsquos Friday night music documentaries, to erudite and in-depth explorations of art and science, BBC Four ndash for me at least ndash fulfils the pledge to educate, entertain and inform. Butthe BBC was to disappear, alternatives do exist ndash Sky Arts and a plethora of documentary channels.However, BBC Four is the broadcasterrsquos least-watched channel. In , BBC One had a reach of  million, Channel   million, BBC Two  million, Channel   million, ITV  million. BBC Four had a reach of  million, putting it in the same fighting weight as ITV and Dave.Perhaps thatrsquos because the upstart Netflix has got into documentaries in a big way. The BBCrsquos Storyville strand was once the gold standard of TV documentary making, but these daysyou want to watch an Oscar-winning documentary, or a documentary thatrsquos going to show you things yoursquove never seen before, then Netflix is the place to go. And, of course, therersquos Channel rsquos acclaimed factual output as well, which also easily rivals the BBC.The most remarkable water-cooler documentary of the last year was Tell Me Who I Am on Netflix ndash charting the story of the lives of two adult male twins, one of whom had lost their memory, while the other lived with the knowledge of the history of abuse they had suffered as children.For me, itrsquos BBC One I could really do without. I find its drama output poor, its light entertainment toe-curling. For light entertainment, I head to Channel . If I want something relatively mindless, Irsquoll opt for Gogglebox or First Dates rather than Strictly Come Dancing.In terms of BBC drama, even Line Of Duty or Bodyguard ndash which critics responded to asShakespeare had risen from the grave ndash are in my opinion just cliche-riddled cop shows.If I want original drama then Irsquoll likely turn to Channel  once again, or Netflix, Amazon Prime or Sky with their streaming box sets. You donrsquot get great long-form TV drama on the BBC. A series like Killing Eve is a rarity. HBO is the global hub of the best TV drama, with a pedigree of refined and intelligent programming like The Wire, Six Feet Under and The Sopranos.If you want to watch a great blockbuster series like Game Of Thrones ndash also from HBO ndash then yoursquore more likely to find it on Sky Atlantic than the BBC. A new comedy  Netflix is where Irsquoll look.Therersquos something quintessentially middle-class, middle-aged and middle-brow about BBC drama and comedy. If you distilled BBC drama down into one show it would probably look like Last Tango In Halax. Itrsquos a family saga set in Yorkshire. Itrsquos relatively entertaining, a sort of Cold Feet meets All Creatures Great And Small. Itrsquos cosy ndash as edgy as a butter kne.Channel  drama reflects British le back to viewers in a much more sophisticated way, while Netflix takes you all over the world in a kaleidoscope of genres. Therersquos German thrillers, French horror, Brazilian sci-fi, Belgium cop shows, American comedies, Israeli spy dramas. Itrsquos unusual for me now to watch a long-running show unless itrsquos on Netflix.For films, we never choose the BBC or any other terrestrial channel. We search Sky Cinema, Netflix and Amazon. Why wait until pm to watch a movie on the BBC when you can stream the same movie right now from another service No-one in my house is that interested in sport, but itrsquos how wersquove chosen to opt out of sports programming thatrsquos important, in terms of how the BBC offers its services. With our household Sky package wersquove said no to the sports subscription. Our children are now adults, so wersquove long cancelled the subscription to kidsrsquo programming. Wersquove modelled our Sky subscription around what we like as a family: drama, comedy, films and documentaries.Choice is often hugely overrated ndash just think of all those hours yoursquove spent scrolling through Netflix trying to find something to watch but bewildered by choice. However, flexibility in choosing what you pay for is only fair. Sky understands that I donrsquot like sport so makes it possible for me to buy the bits I want, and discard the bits I donrsquot. The BBC doesnrsquot get it ndash yet.Why canrsquot I pay for the BBCrsquos documentaries, its quizzesand radio ndash and dump the rest  I donrsquot want soaps, terrible Saturday night shows, and mediocre dramas. Irsquom also happy to pay for BBC news. The full-spectrum hatred that BBC news gets proves that in terms of journalism itrsquos doing its job.However, the rest of the BBCrsquos output isnrsquot for me. So reduce my licence fee accordingly. Netflix and Sky have flexible packages, why not the BBC  A flexible BBC subscription fee doesnrsquot immediately mean an end to all Government support. Some state funding could remain. But thatrsquos another discussion.From April, the licence fee will be pound. a year. Make my payment proportional to my consumption. If I want to opt into everything, fine, charge me the full pound.. If I want a slimmed-down package, then charge me a fair share. Netflix, for example, charges for three dferent packages: Basic at pound. per month, Standard at pound., and Premium at pound..Unlike every other media outlet, the BBC doesnrsquot woo me for my money, it demands my money. The others earn it, they persuade me to part with my cash ndash and they donrsquot have the law on their side threatening court.I always thought Irsquod remain a loyal BBC subject. But Irsquom starting to rebel. I donrsquot want to be a subject any longer. Irsquod like to take control of what I pay for. So, in answer to the question I posed myself ndash does the BBC really matter  ndash Irsquom increasingly leaning towards the answer: sadly, less and less.The media landscape has changed ndash but the BBC hasnrsquot. The result is that while once I truly thought I couldnrsquot imagine a world without the BBC, Irsquom coming to the unhappy conclusion that although I wouldnrsquot want to do without the BBC completely,I had to give it up, I could as there are plenty of good alternatives out there now.The only way the BBC can win back people like me is for the broadcaster to change and enter the st century before itrsquos too late."},{"url":null,"title":"international-scottish-winter-climbing-meet-returns-four-year-absence","story":"Climbers from around the world ndash including some of the planetrsquos best ndash have headed to Scotland this week to take part in a special event being revived by Mountaineering Scotland after a four-year absence.To mark the beginning of the ,-strong bodyrsquos th anniversary year, Streap Alba Geamhradh  ndash the International Scottish Winter Climbing Meet ndash is ing for the first time since .Mountaineers from  dferent countries have assembled on the slopes of Scotlandrsquos uplands for a week of climbing which will see them take on classic routes, tackle technical test-pieces and perhaps complete brand new first ascents as they experience the delights of winter climbing in Scotland.Among their number are veterans of Everest and the Greater Ranges, as well as leading Alpinists. But they wonrsquot be staying in cosy chalets, as accommodation will be mountaineers huts ndash ldquobothy-like, in the words of one organiser ndash where home comforts are hard to find.But while the facilities may offer the authentic Scottish climbing experience, nerves have been frayed waiting for the weather to play its part.A relatively warm December and January over Scotlandrsquos high ground had meant that the festival was facing poor conditions in gullies and clfs, which are normally cloaked in the snow and ice that makes them an international draw in winter for the worldrsquos mountaineers.But as the weather worsens for everyone , for the mountaineers conditions are improving as the cold, wind and wet moves in.Simon Richardson, one of Scotlandrsquos foremost winter climbers who sits on the organising committee for the festival, said: ldquoParticipants of the International Winter Meet have been anxiously watching the Scottish weather for several weeks now. After the warm December and January the prospects for winter climbing looked bleak.ldquoFortunately, the February conveyor belt of westerly storms has changed all that. There is plenty of snow across the Highlands, and ice is building rapidly. Ben Nevis and the mountains of Glen Coe are ice-making machines that love frequent blizzards and rapid temperature fluctuations.ldquoThe soft aerated Scottish ice occurs in very few parts of the world and is a delight to climb, and ice climbs in Scotland are highly sought after by International climbers.He added: ldquoThis weather trend looks set to continue through the week of the meet, and winter climbers from both the UK and overseas are looking forward to some superb ice-climbing conditions.The winter meet started in  and ran for  years. The last meet was held by the British Mountaineering Council in , but this yearrsquos revival, led by Mountaineering Scotland, recognises the key role that the event has played on the world mountaineering stage, bringing climbers together to share ideas and form new plans.Richardson said: ldquoThe spin-offs of winter meets have been huge. Regardless of the weather, all the meets have been hugely successful and have become a key event in the mountaineering calendar. International partnerships have formed and climbers have shared techniques and equipment. The meet has also helped shape the ethics of world mountaineering.ldquoAt the turn of this century, dry tooling was all the rage ndash highly gymnastic climbing using ice tool and crampons ndash but these routes required extensive preparation with drilled holds and were protected by bolts.ldquoThe Scottish ethic of climbing routes from the ground up and on sight, and not drilling holes in the rock, was in direct contrast to this and, after visiting Scotland, many visitors understood our ethic and have started to apply this more aesthetic approach in other parts of the world.Partnerships formed on the meets have resulted in dozens of important new routes across the world, and helped push mountaineering to new frontiers.Richardson added: ldquoPerhaps the most striking example of this was the first winter conditions ascent of the North Face of North Twin in the Canadian Rockies [which is] higher and steeper than the Eiger and one of the most formidable alpine walls in the world.ldquoIt was climbed by Steve House of the USA and Marko Prezelj from Slovenia in , where they used Scottish approach. Both climbers met on the Scottish winter meet.ldquoSeveral of the worldrsquos greatest ascents in recent years have derived from partnerships created at the winter meet. The most recent example is the UKrsquos Tom Livingstone and Alescaron Cesen and Luka Stra#ar, both Slovenian, who met on the last winter meet in .ldquoIn August , they made the first ascent of the North Face of Latok I in the Karakoram ndash one of the most coveted prizes in world mountaineering. The route was first attempted in  and had defeated  subsequent expeditions. They were awarded the Piolets drsquoOr, the highest honour in mountaineering, for their ascent.During the week, climbers will stay in some of Scotlandrsquos most famous winter climbing arenas, including the Cairngorms, Lochaber and Glen Coe, being accommodated in mountaineering huts such as the famous Charles Inglis Clark Memorial Hut beneath the massive clfs on the north face of Ben Nevis.The event is being staged with the help of the Scottish Mountaineering Club , the Alpine Club and the British Mountaineering Council, and is sponsored by clothing and equipment manufacturer Salewa.John Fowler, president of the SMC, which owns three of the huts accommodating climbers, said: ldquoThe Scottish Mountaineering Club is delighted to contribute to this international event and welcomes the opportunity to showcase the impressive nature of Scottish winter climbing to some of the best mountaineers from home and abroad.All abilities are represented, with climbers from Israel and South Africa, who have little opportunity to climb snow and ice in their own countries, through to regular winter climbers from Europe, Scandinavia and North America.Host climbers from the UK have been selected to match the abilities of the international mountaineers.These include Paul Ramsden, one of the worldrsquos most accomplished mountaineers and three times winner of the Piolets drsquoOr ndash mountaineeringrsquos highest award.The groups will rotate around each of the locations to ensure everyone gets to experience the ied terrain Scotland can offer.Stuart Younie, chief executive of Mountaineering Scotland, said: ldquoWe want to give the climbers as authentic a Scottish mountaineering experience as possible. In previous years, they would have stayed in a hotel and been based in one place, but here they are staying in the huts right on the doorstep of incredible mountaineering locations.ldquoIrsquod describe the huts as one step up from a bothy. Theyrsquore basic but warm and dry with showers and bunks, offering the type of accommodation any Scottish mountaineer is familiar with.ldquoAnd out on the mountains, we want the groups to experience snow and ice and all the conditions which the country is famous for.Younie added: ldquoA lot of them have told us thatrsquos what theyrsquore here for and wersquore glad it looks like the weather isnrsquot going to disappoint."},{"url":null,"title":"race-save-music-schools-deacon-blue-star-dougie-vipond-speaks","story":"Having gone there specically because of the reputation of music teachers Keith Hamilton and Brian Duguid, he said the encouragement he received and the opportunities he was given ndash all free of charge ndash did not just enhance his le, they shaped it too.ldquoPark Mains had an amazing music department, he said. ldquoIt had jazz bands, orchestras ndash there was something going on every night.ldquoI came from a background where no one had a career in music or would have contemplated a career in music, but going through that school, being under the influence of those teachers and being taken along by their enthusiasm meant that I could go to the RSAMD [now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland] to study percussion.While that paved the way for him to join a high-profile group that has endured for three decades, it is an opportunity that vanishingly few children are now able to enjoy.According to figures compiled by the Improvement Service, a government-funded organisation whose remit is to help councils ldquoimprove the health, quality of le and opportunities of all people in Scotland, all but six local authorities now charge for instrumental music tuition in schools.That figure is likely to fall to five after Edinburgh City Council this week voted to slash pound, from its music budget.The disparity between what parents across the country are expected to pay is stark, with those in Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Orkney and Renfrewshire paying nothing at all while at the most extreme end those in Clackmannanshire, West Lothian, the Highlands and East Renfrewshire pay respective annual sums of pound, pound, pound and pound.Nor is there any certainty around what parents within a given local authority area are likely to have to pay, with some councils imposing steady increases over the years, some introducing large, sporadic hikes and others flip-flopping between raising, lowering and eliminating fees.Argyll  Bute and Stirling, for example, have generally raised the cost of music lessons in line with inflation, while North Lanarkshire, which tomorrow will discuss measures that could see its service scrapped completely, has kept its fee-rate static at pound for the past eight years.Midlothian has taken a far more scatter-gun approach, raising its charges incrementally between   and  , before halving them from pound to pound in  . It then charged nothing for two years before last year introducing annual fees of pound. in addition to floating a now-abandoned idea of discontinuing the service.Elsewhere in the Lothians, West Lothian went from charging nothing up to   to imposing fees of pound, while in East Lothian fees went from zero to pound in the same year.The impact this is having on pupil participation has been laid bare in the Improvement Service report, which showed that while overall learner numbers dropped by five per cent between   and the current school year, in some charging authorities they plummeted by close to %.In Aberdeen, where the cost of group lessons has fallen from pound to pound but the cost of inidual tuition has risen from pound to pound, pupil numbers have almost halved from , to ,, although the council said that can be partially explained by a change in the way the data is collected.In West Lothian, meanwhile, learner numbers fell by % year-on-year while in Midlothian they fell by %, and in East Lothian by %.History shows that pupil numbers tend to bounce back in the years following a large drop-off, but concerns have been raised about the impact this is having on the demographics of the children being given the opportunity to learn. Those whose parents can afford to pay and those who are granted a concession because they are in receipt of free school meals tend to fill the spaces, but there is an emerging group of pupils in the middle who are being squeezed out of lessons completely.ldquoTherersquos a chasm in the middle where parents will be choosing between getting their car MOTrsquod or paying for music lessons, said North Lanarkshire percussion teacher Kirk Richardson. ldquoThese are people with jobs, who could pay years ago but now canrsquot afford it.ldquoTherersquos a whole middle section there who wersquore not looking after and thatrsquos the sad bit.Some schools are taking action to ensure that group is not squeezed out completely, with the headteacher at Newbattle High School in Midlothian using general school funds to ensure every childrsquos lessons are paid for them.However, Midlothian woodwind teacher Fiona Gray said that while this is an ldquohonourable thing to do, she noted that it is creating as unlevel a playing field within the local authority area as already exists across council boundaries.ldquoNewbattle is in a catchment where lots of children are falling in the middle and are not eligible for free lessons, she said.ldquoTherersquos a bursary scheme but you have to be below a certain level to get it. A lot of pupils are just above that level but their parents canrsquot afford to pay.ldquoThe headteacher is for very honourable reasons paying for all instrumental lessons for all pupils, which is wonderful, but we donrsquot have an equal and fair playing field for pupils in other schools.In the Western Isles, the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is also introducing measures designed to ensure its music service can be maintained at as low a cost as possible, with the council currently only charging for lessons in stringed instruments. Its solution is to make use of its digital learning hub e-sgoil, which sees pupils across the area get face-to-face lessons at least once a month with the remainder provided via video link.Other authorities are taking the Western Islesrsquo lead, with Orkney and Argyll  Bute already using some form of digital learning while Highland, Aberdeenshire and West Lothian are considering it. Dumfries  Galloway, which will look at proposals to axe instrument tuition completely when it meets later this week, is also contemplating an e-sgoil-type approach, although Andrew OrsquoHalloran, local secretary of the EIS union, said the solution is considered to be far from perfect.ldquoWersquove made it quite clear to the local authority that the technology has to be right first, he said. ldquoThe costs involved in introducing a technology solution would be far greater in the first year than the savings [they would make]they cut teachers or introduced charging. That model would be a long-term solution.The reason charging exists at all is that musical instrument tuition is not classed a core part of the education curriculum, meaning the Scottish Government does not provide funding for it as part of its local authority settlement. Though the Government has repeatedly said it expects councils to make music lessons free at the point of delivery, because they are classed as discretionary authorities are free to fund them as they see fit ndash or to scrap them altogetherthat suits their budgetary plans.Campaigner Ralph Riddiough, a lawyer and community musician from Ayrshire, has mounted a legal challenge to the Governmentrsquos position that music lessons are non-core, which,successful, would put the responsibility on the Government to fund tuition for children across Scotland. The Government is due to respond to his challenge at the beginning of next month.Regardless of what that response says, Mr Vipond ndash and everyone  campaigning to safeguard the provision of music lessons in Scottish schools ndash believes the Government must now step up to the mark, class music tutors as teachers who are integral to the education system and fund the service they provide.ldquoThe Curriculum for Excellence is supposed to be about educating the whole child you canrsquot just pick and choose who gets the chance to have a full education, Mr Vipond said.ldquoItrsquos a real shame that this has become a postcode lottery and the Government saying it should be free but itrsquos up to the councils to pay for it is not fair. Theyrsquore washing their hands of the issue.ldquoThey are under a lot of pressure but this is our future. Do we want kids who can pass exams or do we want kids who can explore their potential  I want to live in a country where innovation and talent and the ability to work together are valued. I donrsquot want us churning out a bunch of robots that can just do exams."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-confirms-plans-stay-snp-leader---says-scottish-independence-referendum-must-legal","story":"Responding to rumours about her future, Nicola Sturgeon said she plans to lead her party into next years Holyrood election and hopefully beyond.She also addressed growing calls for a radical approach to achieving Scottish independence, saying testing the ability of the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum in court was \"not her preferred approach\".Ms Sturgeon told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show she was \"working towards\" another independence referendum by the end of this year, a position she has held since before Decembers general election.She said: \"I appreciate that some people are impatient for independence - Im impatient for independence.:Independence referendum could absolutely happen this year, says Nicola Sturgeon\"But whats most important of all is that we have a referendum thats legal, legitimate and can actually deliver independence.\"The First Ministers request for a Section  order, which would provide the necessary devolution of powers to hold another vote, was rejected by Downing Street.Ms Sturgeon did not rule out the idea of testing the limits of the constitution in court, in a bid to seethe Scottish Parliament could legislate for another poll, however she described it as not being her \"preferred option\".The SNP leader has said she is focused on winning the \"political case\" for independence, saying that the position of the Prime Minister to withhold powers for the vote was \"not sustainable\".Some in the SNP have offered up other options to increase the pressure on Downing Street, including the holding of a referendum without UK Government permission, described by MP Angus MacNeil as \"plan B\".Ms Sturgeon said assertions that the case for independence had \"hit a brick wall\" were \"wrong\".She said: \"Support for independence is rising.

However, community groups across the country have been galvanised of late to save these important Victorian and Edwardian structures.Now one group of students is hoping to help not just restore one sea pool at one picture-postcard village on the Fe coast - but help turn it into a sustainable tourist attraction.Stage  Architecture students at The Glasgow School of Art are undertaking the project which will see them create proposals for building near the historic Pittenweem tidal pool including a st century thermal baths, changing rooms together with a cafe.:Scotlands outdoor pools that you can enjoy this summerLast year The West Braes Project in Fe secured the funding needed to carry out the first phase of work on the regeneration of the Pittenweem tidal pool.: An open-air swimming pool set amongst the rocks on the shore of Dunbar, East Lothian. .The grouprsquos aim is to improve disabled access and create a purpose-built building nearby which could house a heritage centre, toilet and shower facilities, and a community-run cafe.The project team is hoping that work will start on rejuvenating the pool this spring.And the Mackintosh School of Architecture at the GSA is challenging its Stage  students to create proposals for a sustainable building near the sea pool, the designs for which will be driven by considerations of climate change and accessibility.:Wild swimming becomes Scotlands latest tourism crazeGlasgow students have met The West Braes Project team and learn more about both the history of the pool and the plans for its future.ldquoA central tenet of the GSArsquos approach to architecture teaching and learning is that it is grounded in the practical, live brief, says Stage  Leader Kathy Li. ldquoStudents are challenged to bring their creativity to designs that respond to real le scenarios.ldquoWe are delighted to be working with the team from The West Braes Project in Pittenweem as they undertake the rejuvenation of the historic tidal pool. For our students this offers the chance to learn more about the social history of these coastal structures in general and to create designs that envisage a future for Pittenweem tidal pool, especially one that opens up access for as many people as possible.ldquoThere is no question that the biggest challenge that we face as a planet is climate change.

But who fuels them And can -tonne artics ever really be green-powered Peter Eaton thinks so. His business already tanks up lorries in England with compressed biogas made from food slops, cow dung and ndash hold your noses as you read ndash sewage sludge. That means some of the food we eat will be transported using the energy left over in the food we throw away ndash or the food we have already eaten.Mr Eaton and his firm, CNG Fuels, is now aiming to open its first two filling stations in Scotland, both in Lanarkshire, the nationrsquos transportation hub.His clients include supermarkets such as Waitrose and Asda, as well as parcel delivery giant Hermes.He said: ldquoIt could be decades before there are electric batteries strong enough for big trucks. Our fuel reduces thecarbon footprint of a truck by more than per cent.CNG Fuels has planning permission for one site, at Bellshill, and applied for another, in Larkhall, just off the M.The stations are big ndash the Larkhall planning application predicts  trucks will be filled up a day. Its fuel does not smell of what it is made from. It is methane of the kind generated by anaerobic digestionplants up and down the UK. But because it is recycledit does not count towards the carbon footprint of those who use it.Mr Eaton explained the stations are designed to let lorries top up their tanks after the long haul from Lancashire ndash or before they make the trip back down.There are no facilities of this kind in Scotland. Subject to planning permission, CNG Fuels aims to put more in place.Most transport experts think Scotland and the rest of the UK is on the cusp of an electric car revolution. The technology is also expected to spread to vans.Heavy trucks, however, present a bigger dficulty. Forty-four-tonne delivery lorries are hard to power with a battery. So are heavy bin collection vehicles. Some manufacturing operators are looking at hydrogen. Others at biogas.Richard Dixon, of Friends Of The Earth Scotland, welcomed the move, as a stop-gap. ldquoUsing biomethane from anaerobic digestions is a good option, making constructive use of some of the huge amount of food we waste every year, he said. ldquoAlthough we should be moving as much as possible by rail freight, wherewe really do need a lorry to do a journey then running on biomethane is better than running on diesel, for both climate and local air pollution.Even critics acknowledge food trucks are here to stay. Motor manufacturer Daf has listed some of the facts about lorries moving food. Trucks, it said, carry million tonnes of food a billion kilometres a year in the UK alone. That accounts for two-thirds of road freight, and % of food shipments.Pete Ritchie, of sustainable food campaign group Nourish Scotland, wants to reduce those figures.ldquoThere is an old saying about Scotland, he said. ldquoWe grow potatoes and we buy crisps. We should be doing much more food manufacturing in Scotland rather than just producing raw materials.ldquoWe should be looking, for example,to see more glasshouses producing vegetables, rather than, say, importing tomatoes from Spain.For Mr Ritchie, trucking tomatoes just means moving water in lorries from the south of Europe to the north. Other northern countries, including Russia, the Netherlands, Iceland and Sweden have developed systems of winter glasshouse vegetables.The Herald understands there have been business plans in Scotland to use biogas to heat greenhouses. Some environmentalists, however, fear the biogas industry creates a perverse incentive not to cut back on waste.Others argue nutrients in food waste are being wasted by AD or even incineration. Scotland, for example, still burns sewage sludge, the brown residue left after wastewater treatment.CNG Fuels does not make biogas. It buys it from manufacturers that are also supplying the product to the national grid."},{"url":null,"title":"first-book-tartans-scottish-clans-sold","story":"James Loganrsquos lavishly illustrated book, The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, was produced to commemorate the centenary of the last Jacobite uprising.The publication, produced in London by Ackermann and Co, is now regarded as the most complete record of Highland dress of the day.

My advice to the Government would be: sit up and pay attention because this is definitely going to affect you.First, a recap of what the report said. The number of pupils achieving passes in the core Higher subjects dropped signicantly in . Maths: down . per cent. English: down .%. And history: down %. There were some subjects that showed an improvement ndash PE and biology for example ndash but overall the picture was grim. And it didnrsquot help that the Government tried to sneak the report out last thing at night when they thought journalists wouldnrsquot be looking. Wrong. It just made the whole thing look worse.The terrible Higher results are also, clearly, a symptom of several deeper problems in Scottish education, but two in particular came up in my conversations with the teachers and parents. First, the effect that large, mixed-ability classes is having on pupils, and second, the effect that workload and staffing is having on teachers. Parents and teachers are worried, and stressed, and have been for years.But let me tell you about one teacher and one parent in particular because theyrsquore the ones who know whatrsquos happening on the ground. The teacher has more than  years of experience in English and works at a city comprehensive with a mixed intake the parent is a mother of two kids at secondary who are also at a mixed-ability school. Both the teacher and the parent have voted SNP in the pastthey also support independence. This is signicant because what they, and others like them, do next is going to affect the Scottish elections in .:Analysis: Does Derek Mackay scandal mark the beginning of the end for the SNP So herersquos what the parent told me. The Curriculum for Excellence isnrsquot working. Class sizes are too big. The wide range of abilities in classrooms is badly affecting the brightest kids who arenrsquot getting pushed to their full potential, with the result that everyone gets a middling mark and results start to suffer. She also said teachers were too aware of the league tables and held some pupils back from National  to make the results look better. And she said she felt forced to get tutors for her boys even though money is tight. The situation is bad, she said, really bad.Now herersquos what the teacher told me. He too said that the Curriculum for Excellence isnrsquot working. He also said pupils are suffering because there are so many kids with additional support needs in mainstream classes with next to no support. Then therersquos staffing. Teachers are sourced from overseas to fill the gaps, but when they arrive, the reality quickly becomes apparent and they leave again, so more teachers are sourced from overseas. The phrase the teacher used to describe the education situation in Scotland was ldquofreefall.The consequences of everything they said are clear. If you have some pupils whose potential isnrsquot being fully realised, and you have some parents employing tutors, the gap between the better-off and less-well-off pupils is going to get worse. In fact, itrsquos already happening. In the words of one parent I spoke to ldquothose who canrsquot afford tutors are seriously stuffed and the government report admits it too: lower-attaining pupils, it says, are not improving at the same rate as higher-attaining pupils. The effect of parental income was also obvious in The Heraldrsquos story at the weekend about the falling number of pupils taking music tuition because some councils have introduced fees.The potential political consequences are also interesting. Some of the people I spoke to are not SNP supporters, but the mother and teacher Irsquove quoted are. They also both voted Yes in , but how theyrsquoll vote in the  Scottish Parliament election is up for grabs. The teacher tells me he spoiled his ballot in last Decemberrsquos General Election and therersquos no way he would vote SNP next year. The parent did vote SNP in Decemberbut said she wonrsquot vote SNP again until the situation in schools improves. She may vote Green, she hasnrsquot decided.:SNP tensions flare after BBC report on Nicola Sturgeons shelf-leWhat this means,replicated more widely, is the SNP is unlikely to advance in  and the majority they need for a second referendum is at risk. Some disgruntled SNP voters will switch to the Greens, like the mother of two says she may do, and this means there could still be a combined Green SNP majority. But with the education situation so bad, and with so many parents and teachers unhappy, therersquos also a chance that enough people will feel unable to vote SNP next time that they will narrowly lose their majority, even with Green support.The issue of independence will, obviously, keep some people in the SNP fold, but increasingly I think some voters are prepared to separate out support for independence and support for the SNP. The teacher and parent I spoke to would still vote Yes to independenceor when they get the chance ndash their support for that hasnrsquot wavered one bit ndash but their disgust and disillusionment with the SNP over education means they are prepared, for the first time, to vote against them at a General Election. They know that failing to support the SNP puts a second referendum at risk but they are prepared to do it anyway and leave the issue of independence for another day.This is perhaps the lesson that the SNP needs to take away from all of this. There are some SNP supporters who think the party is immune from the usual political consequences of doing a bad job on schools or hospitals, and to some extent, for now, it is. I also think scandals like the Derek Mackay affair are not going to have much effect.But on policy and performance, the cracks are there. Theyrsquore in the overcrowded schoolrooms, and in the living rooms where children are getting extra tuition, and in the staffrooms where teachers are talking about their daily struggles. These cracks could grow, or they could heal. But whatever happens, the crisis in education could be the issue that narrowly decides next yearrsquos election."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-impact-future-primark-supply","story":"However, it said the high street giant, which sources numerous products from China, is ldquowell stocked with cover for several months and does not expect any ldquoshort-term impact as a result of the virus.:Primark to open  new stores | Simply Be owner cuts profit forecast | Halfords bike sales riseABF said it is assessing plans to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on Primark, including the possibility of increasing production from suppliers in other regions.The FTSE  firm also said it has some food operations in China, with its AB Mauri, AB Agri and Ovaltine factories in the country operating at reduced capacity due to ldquolabour and logistics constraints.The warning came as ABF said half-year sales and operating profit growth are both expected to surpass expectations following strong sales at the high street retailer.The group said Primark sales in the first half of the financial year are .% higher than the same period last year, as it was boosted by recent site expansions.The group said it was on track to post full-year figures in line with expectations, on the back of strong group sales and profits for the half year to February .Associated British Foods said Primarkrsquos UK sales are expected to have risen % against last year following store expansions and openings.:Woman lsquosold for pound, outside city Primark storersquoMeanwhile, like-for-like sales are expected to have dropped .% over the half-year period.The firm said UK sales were ldquoparticularly good in November and December but have ldquoweakened in January and February.Elsewhere, ABF said revenues in its sugar business are expected to improve on last year due to higher EU sugar prices and increased export sales.The firmrsquos grocery business has seen revenues in line with expectations, while profits have improved against last year, as the firm benefited from reduced losses in its troubled Allied Bakeries business, which produces Kingsmill bread.It said its Twinings tea business has seen higher sales than last year, driven by growth across both black tea and herbal tea."},{"url":null,"title":"have your say on future of library services","story":"A series of open public engagement events will be held in libraries throughout Aberdeenshire next week.The informal drop-in sessions will give people the chance to find out more about Live Le Aberdeenshire’s plans for developing libraries, and the opportunity to share their opinions and ideas about future services.An online survey seeking views on future library provision runs until the end of the month and has already attracted more than , responses.The open sessions in communities are intended to complement this survey, seeking the opinions of those who use – or don’t yet use – their local library.Knowledgeable staff will be on hand in each venue to talk through planned changes and improvements, with a wealth of information about the ways in which libraries fit into community le at the moment.Modern libraries aim to be at the heart of their community - a safe and neutral space to browse, learn and meet people.Take this opportunity to shape your local library service over a cup of tea and a chat.Public engagement events:Ellon Library: Tuesday, February  - am to pm.Inverurie Library: Thursday, February  - am to pm.Kemnay Community Cafe, Kemnay Hall: Friday, February  - .am to .am.Kintore Library: Monday, February  - .pm to pm.Meldrum Library: Tuesday, February  - pm to pm.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility. Since then, little progress has been made.“What has happened, however, is that the ferries operating these leline routes have got older, less reliable and more costly to run. Despite the best efforts of crews, we have seen increasing levels of disruption, including the ongoing problems with the MV Eynhallow. This situation is simply not sustainable and needs to be addressed.“Scottish Government needs to agree a clear timetable for taking forward the procurement of replacement vessels so that communities in Orkney have the leline services they deserve.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual.

Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"family of caroline flack share unpublished instagram she wanted to post","story":"The family of Caroline Flack have released an unpublished Instagram post that the star wrote in the days before her death, in which she said that within  hours her whole world and future had been swept from under her feet.The -year-old former Love Island host, who took her own le, described the domestic incident with boyfriend Lewis Burton as \"an accident\".\"On December the th  I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"Within  hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me, collapsed.\"I am suddenly on a dferent kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen.\"I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night.\"Even on the night.\"But the truth is ...

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

There is much more ‘going ons’ than merely learning lines and ‘tech’ work as the -strong cast fill the stage and raise the roof with their storming ‘Another Op’nin, Another Show’ number.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“Properties are in limited supply in areas of greatest need such as NB.“Since , , new social homes have been acquired or built in North Belfast. We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in .

It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young buyers in belfast","story":"IN spite of all the uncertainties young people are confronted with in Belfast and across the north more generally – from Brexit to political instability, to the alleged ‘brain drain’ effect and the looming threat of recession – many still choose to set down long-term roots here. The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus northern irish singer rebecca harkin tells of relief after leaving diamond princess cruise ship to unwind in australia","story":"Rebecca HarkinPassengers leaving the Diamond Princess cruise shipPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRebecca HarkinBy Claire O#BoyleFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Irish singer Rebecca Harkin has told how she had finally left a cruise ship at the centre of the coronavirus crisis - and is set to spend two weeks unwinding in Australia.Musician Rebecca, who had been on board The Diamond Princess as part of the entertainment crew, said she and her partner had been taken off the ship, and thanked fans for their support.Four of the cruise ship passengers flown to England this weekend tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to .

Anyone aged  or over can join the Luncheon Club, with many members also availing of the free transport service provided for those living within two miles of Abbey House.The service also provides takeaway meals for older people who may be sick or have mobility problems.Kevin Doherty has been a member for the last  months and goes to Abbey House five times a week from his home in Donal Casey Court, a Choice Housing sheltered scheme located next to Templemore Sports Complex on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push Recommended“During a stay in hospital, healthcare staff were worried about how I would look after myself when I got home as I don’t cook and recommended the luncheon club. “The food is very good the casseroles and stews are my favourite and they do fish every Friday. “But the main benefit is the company, it gets you out of the house and I’ve made many friends here. I get picked up by the Apex bus and left home too you couldn’t ask for a better service.”Eileen White has been attending the Luncheon Club for the last six years, getting the Apex minibus every weekday from her home in Alexander House, an Apex sheltered scheme in Bishop Street.

I’ve got to know so many people and twice a week I leave from the Luncheon Club and go to older people’s clubs in the Gasyard and Brandywell. Takeaway meals“Anyone living on their own should join a Luncheon Club. It’s a long day sitting by yourself in the house the club has allowed me to meet so many people. I don’t know what I’d do without it.”“In addition to those who attend the club in Abbey House, the service also provides takeaway meals for local people who may be sick or have mobility issues.” John O’Kane says the service has been a ‘God send’ for his mother who broke her hip last year and as a result wasn’t able to cook for herself. “The doctor was concerned about her losing weight and her carers suggested we might be interested in getting meals from the Luncheon Club. “At the time, she was very frail, but now she gets her meals brought to her every day by her carers, has put on weight and looks a lot better for it. “The meals are very high quality and my mother enjoys them – especially the desserts. As I work full-time, I wasn’t able to cook for her every day so this service has been a God send.”Donna Matthewson, from Apex Housing Association, said: “It’s wonderful to hear so many positive experiences of the Luncheon Club in Abbey House. Not only does the service provide nutritious and high quality meals for local older people, it offers an opportunity for friends – new and old – to come together five days a week for a chat and a bit of craic. “Unfortunately, social isolation and loneliness can be a problem faced by many older people.

The win takes Rory Gallaghers men onto five points in the table, into third place on score dference behind Longford and ahead of Down and Offaly. The Oakleafers head to Paacuteirc Uiacute Chaoimh on next week to face leaders Cork before hosting Longford and travelling to Offaly on the last week of the campaign. Derry, playing against the wind, went into a - to - lead with points from Shane McGuiganand Benny Heron. googletag.cmd.push A McGuigan goal helped Derry into a - to - advantage by the eight minute, before Louth recovered to leave just a goal between the sides after  minutes. WATCH - Rory Gallaghers thoughts on Derrys win In the seventh minute, Derrys dominance paid off. A kick-out from Lynch was won by skipper McKaigue. When the play developed forward, Niall Toner drew goalkeeper Craig Lynch before offloading for McGuigan to palm to an empty net. Then came the talking point of the first half when Padraig Cassidy was unceremoniously hauled to the ground by Dermot Campbell but no penalty was given. googletag.cmd.push To rub salt into the wounds, Louth had the ball in the net seconds later. Ryan Burns took advantage of a mix-up and intercepted Odhraacuten Lynchs pass to set upDeclan Byrne for the easiest of goals and the sides were level, - each. Derry led - to - at half-time but Burns curled over two frees to put them into the lead for the first time in the game. McGuigan, who finished with -, levelled matters before Shea Downey floated over the bar. Derry were reduced to  men following Padraig McGrogans black card with six minutes of normal time remaining. The home side eventually broke Louths resolve with a Niall Loughlin goal. The Greenlough man was making a first appearance since Derrys  qualier defeat to Mayo and he palmed home from a Toner pass. Louth replied with two Burns frees and there was just the kick of a ball between the teams again before a curling McGuigan free sealed victory. Gerard McSorley and Brendan Rogers were both dismissed on a second yellow cards, at dferent times, in the closing stages but it mattered little as Derry held on.

Puigdemont, who is living in self-imposed exile in Belgium following his leading role in attempts in recent years to have Catalan declared an independent state from Spain, has accepted an invitation to speak at a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council on May . This followed a motion put forward by People Before Profit councillors, Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, inviting Puigdemont to Derry. In a joint statement, Cllrs Harkin and McCann said they had received confirmation that the Spanish politician would be coming to Derry. googletag.cmd.push The statement said: People Before Profit won the support of Derry and Strabane Council for our motion inviting Puigdemont giving full solidarity to the peaceful Catalan demand for justice for Spanish authorities to end the attempt to repress, criminalise and imprison the movement for independence for prison sentences on Catalan leaders to be rescinded and for the leaders of the EU to end their complicity with the Spanish states attempt to crush the democratic aspiration of the Catalan people.

Harry Gregg, a legend of the game, passed away this week aged . Gregg’s funeral took place in St Patricks Parish Church on Friday, followed by interment in Coleraine Cemetery. Books of condolences have been opened in both the National Stadium at Windsor Park and at Coleraine Town Hall.Gregg was capped  times for Northern Ireland between  and  but is most well-remembered across the world for his time at Manchester United. His career on Manchester was marred by one of the greatest tragedies of world football, the Munich air disaster. On  February , British European Airways Flight  crashed on its third attempt to take off from Munich-Riem Airport, West Germany,  people died that day, many of them Manchester United players. It has been well recorded, the bravery and actions of Gregg on the site of the crash, having survived, he ed to save a -month old baby, her badly injured pregnant mother and dragged Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet from the wreckage by their waistbands.Tony O’Doherty, Derry City Director and former Northern Ireland footballer, got to know Gregg during summers in Coleraine as a boy. “Harry would have been there, training in the Showgrounds with Victor Hunter and Ian McFaul. Its quite amazing when you think of it, I never realised as a boy but it was three international goalkeepers.”Tony remembers a humility about Gregg that could sometimes be sharp. “Harry was the most down to earth person you ever met in your le, but be prepared because he would know you five minutes and he would very quickly tell you what he thought of you,” he laughed. googletag.cmd.push PlauditsThe plaudits and title of hero never sat well with Gregg who remarked in his autobiography, “Munich has cast a shadow over my le which I found dficult to dispel.” Tony said it seemed that Harry distanced himself from Munich, “Certainly in my company and from people closer to him say, he never talked about it.”Gregg was a teacher in those times, not to outfield players like Tony but to the international goalkeepers around him. “Certainly as a young player he would have watched me and chatted to me but any tips would have been for goalkeepers,” he said. “He must have known something about the goalkeeping arts, to become an international. You knew he was something special. When I was growing up in the game we used to say, I’m sure they still do now, that goalkeepers were ‘mad’ in the nicest sense of the word.” googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Harry Gregg made his name with Manchester United, Northern Ireland and as a hero of the Munich Air Disaster. That huge personality and ‘something special’ was deployed on the pitch and was part of Gregg’s game. O’Doherty says, “That larger than le character was how he kept out goals as well, people talk about commanding your penalty area, Harry certainly did, make no mistake.”Tony struck a relationship with Harry in that time and regularly bumped into Gregg. “My last memory of him was  or  years ago, during Victor Hunter’s testimonial and I actually played in it believe it or not, along with Teddy Sheringham,” he recalled. “I went to go off at half time. Teddy told me, ‘you’re not going off, you’re my legs!’Just as I pulled up to get to that game, Harry pulled in beside me and I had a chat with him.” “He wasn’t just larger than le outside the game he was larger than on the pitch.” Harry Gregg played  times for United, and as it has been remarked in the last few mournful days, his strength of will and character was epitomised in a - win over Sheffield Wednesday, just  days after the Munich tragedy.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose.

before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden

Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar community facility unused over power supply issue  ","story":"A COMMUNITY centre in Ballykinlar is lying unused because it has no electricity supply, it emerged this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run facility.The centre, a prefabricated building formerly used by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service in Downpatrick, was moved to the former Kindle Primary School School site in Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE

Our aim is to effectively address the childrenrsquos needs and prevent exclusion from the classroom and any distress caused by them not having the coping skills, through no fault of their own.Garry Hanna, chairman of the board of governors, announced that the school will be providing a free-of-charge breakfast club between am and am each morning to working parents who need early morning childcare.He said: ldquoIn order to allow many of our parents greater flexibility with their working arrangements, we will now provide this free service.

Neil Curran was home in ., which was a  second PB for him at this distance. Despite improving on his time, he was non-committal about his performance, feeling that a lack of speed work had left his legs wanting.Runners can be hard on themselves and should remember that performances that they think lack sparkle, may be times that others may only dream of achieving.Jimmyrsquos recceA call had gone out to our members to take part in a recce of the course for the rapidly approaching Jimmyrsquos .It was decided to open this up to all comers and it was a popular move. With representatives from Tels Fitness, Murlough AC, Crossgar Harriers and Down Triathlon Club and some solo runners joining our own crowd, there was a jolly band of nearly  runners hitting the streets.Storm Dennis was a bit of a concern, but having consulted the weather charts it was decided to proceed with caution. In actual fact, although there was a taxing head wind at some points, it was dry until after all ed, so Denis was not able to put off these hardcore folk.They soon warmed up with hot drinks and snacks and the general feeling was that it was a good job, well done. All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out.

Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple.

He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

A  paramilitary report used convoluted language to say republicans believed that such influence still existed. The PSNI has said little in the meantime, seeming instead to want to show republicans a friendly face.It is not just the PSNI but legal, security and political figures who appear to be at pains to avoid making judgement. The Independent Reporting Commission is clearly not the body to give us a comprehensive assessment of the IRA and any influence that the terror group has on politics and society here. We need a new organisation for that vital role.While Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar’s remarks are welcome, and while Mr Martin has long been critical of Sinn Fein, it is too late. Dublin put no pressure on republicans in Northern Ireland, despite their intermittently disgraceful conduct after , or their post  veto on devolution until their blackmail got reward in a powerful Irish language commissioner.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on.
