One member of The Sussex Squad wrote: ‘Kate Middleton is a creepy woman for wearing everything Diana used to wear, trying to win sympathy by using her dead mother-in-law – scary. Zero personality. Duchess Do Little envies Meghan.’Those who back Kate have treated the news of Harry and Meghan’s decision to step back from Royal duties as a gross act of betrayal. ‘SPOILT BRATS,’ one shrieked.         The news that Harry and Meghan plan to step down as senior Royals has caused widespread rejoicing among Kate’s online champions – who have been campaigning for ‘Megxit’ for some time. Kate is pictured above on her birthday earlier this weekUnsurprisingly, it is seen differently by Meghan’s devotees. They view the decision as empowering, an Independence Day for the couple – a sign, perhaps, of The Sussex Squad’s more transatlantic community. ‘It’s a huge decision,’ says one fan, addressing the couple. ‘But you are both strong enough to follow your dreams and I admire your choice.’Bella, 20, from Liverpool, who runs Instagram accounts dedicated to both Royal women, says drawing comparisons ‘comes with the territory’. ‘Her Majesty and Princess Margaret were always compared, as were Fergie and Diana and even Pippa and Kate,’ she said.‘The fact that Kate and Meghan are both beautiful, intelligent women doesn’t help, as people always want to criticise everything they do and say. It’s foolish to compare them because they’re completely different and independent people. I think they’re both inspirational in their own ways.’That may be so. But with super-fans like these, surely everyone can agree on one thing – neither Kate nor Meghan needs enemies."},{"url":null,"title":"Food supply thousands animals trapped Mallacoota flown planes help wombats koalas","story":"Share this article Meanwhile, charity Animals Australia has been using aircraft to transport food supplies for the injured and burnt wildlife in regional Victoria.More than 800,000 hectares of land has been burnt in East Gippsland since fires gripped the region and stranded thousands of tourists and residents before New Year\u0027s Eve.        Charity group Animals Australia has been using aircraft (pictured) to transport food supplies for the injured and burnt wildlife in regional Victoria The organisation has been relying on donations to lease small planes and then filling them with bags of grain and pellets to distribute to wildlife in the region through \u0027Vets for Compassion\u0027.The first plane chartered last weekend flew in Dr Elaine Ong and Dr Chris Barton- the first vets on the ground in Mallacoota.  A subsequent two plane-loads of food and veterinary supplies were sent off on Wednesday to reach the animals around the Mallacoota fire-grounds.          The organisation initially struggled to get food supplies into Mallacoota because of smokey conditions this weekIn total the group has sent three tonnes of food for kangaroos in the area, in addition to a generator and other supplies.Two more planes have been loaded up and will be ready to leave on Monday and Tuesday next week. Animals Australia Spokeswoman, Lyn White, said they\u0027re working as hard as they can to make sure the wildlife that has survived the fires doesn\u0027t die from a lack of food.\u0027With roads likely shut for weeks, the risk of starvation for surviving wildlife in the area is very real,\u0027 she said. \u0027It would be tragic if there was a further loss of life because the needs of surviving animals was not being met.\u0027           Pictured: Wildlife carers in Mallacoota tend to a kangaroo joey injured during the recent bushfires in East Gippsland         Pictured: Wildlife carers in Mallacoota bandaged up a kangaroo who has suffered burns to his feet during the bushfires in East Gippsland        The organisation initially struggled to get supplies in because of the unfavourable conditions.\u0027Fingers crossed for clearer skies today, but we\u0027re working on any and all options to get the food to these hungry animals,\u0027 Animals Australia wrote on Wednesday.But the skies cleared and the drop was successfully made, with the group thanking its supporters for providing the funds to make it possible.  \u0027We continue to be absolutely humbled by the outpouring of love and generosity and support from all across the world. \u0027Today our primary focus is making sure these funds are distributed to wherever they will have the most direct and meaningful impact for animals,\u0027 the group wrote.           Pictured: More than 800,000 hectares of land has been burnt in East Gippsland since fires gripped the region         Pictured: Thousands of wildlife have been injured and left stranded without food supplies after bushfires took out thousands of hectares of land in East Gippsland "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Philips left disbelief Prince Harry Meghan Markle announcement","story":"Share this article Harry and Meghan did not join the rest of the royal family at Sandringham on Christmas Day, instead opting to spend the festive period in Canada.Following their statement on Wednesday, Prince Harry had been due to fly back to Canada with Meghan on Thursday to be united with their eight-month-old son Archie, but decided to stay on in Britain while a deal about their future role is thrashed out.Harry is set travel to Sandringham for a showdown with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William in what sources described as a ‘reality check moment’.Royal aides and Government officials have drawn up a range of scenarios setting out the ‘stark implications’ faced by Harry and Meghan if they abandon or dramatically scale back their royal duties.          A friend has claimed that Prince William is desperately sad that the close relationship he once enjoyed with Prince Harry has soured.

He was never a plausible leader, but he leaves a valuable challenge to the rest of the contestants. He was the most radical in calling for Labour to open its doors to alliances with other parties and back proportional representation to break out of the straitjacket of a broken political system.He forced the unthinkable question: what if Labour can’t win alone if Scotland is gone? Coalitions can inspire new life and ideas, reaching out beyond one-party governments ruling by diktat on a minority of voters. Free to tell truths, Lewis dared suggest that, just possibly, Labour may not be the one and only tabernacle of all truth: it is, after all, an uneasy coalition itself. That, for Labour, is radical thought.As the five remaining candidates line up for gruelling hustings up and down the country, everyone listens for signs, hints and revealing phrases beyond the usual bromides on “social justice”, “radicalism” and “unity”. Anxious to alienate no faction, all call themselves socialist (as did Tony Blair). Each stands on the side of the have-nots against over-mighty haves, striving to redistribute power and pelf between people and regions. Party members must choose how far left you can go and still win, and which one is the most electable.Lewis has left behind one litmus test: do the contenders support electoral reform to break apart the old order? The words “proportional representation” (PR) drop like lead into debates, except among political aficionados. If, like me, you have ever tried going door to door for signatures on a PR petition, you meet a blank stare. Raise it publicly and political obsessives overflow your inbox with reams of new voting schemes. No wonder the Electoral Reform Society pleads on its website: “Unfortunately the ERS cannot offer appraisals of new electoral systems or constitutional designs.”Labour has been adamantly opposed. Blair was hesitantly for it: he commissioned Roy Jenkins to devise a plan keeping the single MP per constituency link but adding a proportional top-up list of MPs reflecting total party votes cast. Party dinosaurs – most trade unions, John Prescott, Jack Straw and others – forced Blair to drop it. PR was a fight too far with his party, so he threw away his chance to truly reshape politics and break the century of Tory hegemony. But now enlightenment has broken out among most of the candidates. Keir Starmer “believes there’s a case for electoral reform, because of the millions of votes wasted every election in safe seats”. He adds the proviso, “reform must ensure it protects the constituency link”, and says he is up for discussion. Reviving the Jenkins plan fits his bill.Jess Phillips, who in the past backed Caroline Lucas’s PR bill, takes the same line. She “would like electoral reform so seats reflect the votes cast” while keeping MPs “rooted in communities”. She adds this wise thought: electoral reform alone is “not a route for Labour out of its current political crisis”. Quite right: Labour would have crashed badly this time under any system.Lisa Nandy is a longtime advocate of progressive alliances but is only “open-minded” on PR. Most backers of alliances see them as a temporary fix coming together to bring in PR.Rebecca Long-Bailey is, as ever, opaque. All her campaign says is that she is “in favour of reviewing our electoral system as part of a wider package of constitutional reform that will be fleshed out in the course of the campaign”. Disappointingly, Emily Thornberry, good in many ways, is the arch-anti-reformer. She was against the alternative vote in the 2011 referendum and strongly backs the current system. “We are all equal with first past the post,” she claims. Which is perverse as it is plainly not so.Thanks to Lewis, electoral reform is now mainstream Labour, and is there to stay if Starmer, Phillips or Nandy wins. This matters not just for fairer elections, or even opening Westminster to new political forces. It matters right now, in opposition, as a flashing beacon that a newly open state of mind is welcoming others, freed from cabals and closed factions, with a more electable aura.All the tactical voting effort was “fundamentally a failure”, says the psephologist Peter Kellner. It won no seats, though it made some close-run. Always a weak attempt to circumvent a bad system, it failed, he says, because too many Liberal Democrat voters found Jeremy Corbyn “anathema”, while Labour voters were deterred from vote-swapping by Jo Swinson’s venomous attacks on their party.After the shocking lies told in both the alternative vote and the Brexit referendum campaigns, who wouldn’t be wary of ever holding another public vote? Kellner suggests that Labour, if in power, could bring in the reform for one election, promising a referendum to confirm it once people had tried it.How remote that prospect seems. Even if Brexit and Boris Johnson do badly, Kellner thinks it unlikely that Labour can win outright next time. But if both Labour and Liberal Democrats had creditable leaders, he thinks that Labour might win 60 extra seats, the Liberal Democrats another 20 and, together with others, break the Tory majority. That needs the next Labour leader to follow those Clive Lewis themes on cooperation, pluralism, and progressive alliances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/598ca83dd2132eb03b56f57d178a6adff48c4a01/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f063b806ec5053d0fd72068f581fb7c","title":"little women joker stop seeing important mediocre films","story":"Browbeating viewers into seeing certain movies shifts blame for a lack of erse storytelling on to audiences, rather than the broken system of film productionIf cinema had the impact on the world that film critics insisted they did in 2019, Joker would have brought about an incel revolution, and Little Women would have ended misogyny.It was not a great year for film, with even our greatest film-makers putting out middling efforts. Yet if you listen to the critics and official opinion-havers online, you could have been convinced that it was a very important year for film. Issue movies took on an outsized influence, and movies that just tried to be movies – entertaining, thought-provoking or pleasurable – were denounced or celebrated as being dangerous or culturally momentous. The stakes this year for every film seemed impossibly high.This was the year police departments issued warnings about the possibility of mass shootings at opening-night screenings of Joker, after all. It was a hysteria that built online after film critics saw the movie at festivals and started to complain it somehow “glamorized” or sympathized with violent incels. (I always thought one of the best things cinema was capable of doing was of sympathizing with the marginalized and misunderstood, but I guess that viewpoint is out of fashion now.)It couldn’t possibly be that Little Women is just a bad movie – although it is. Little Women is one of those books that has been over-adapted, with five previous film adaptations, plus a miniseries, plus a theatrical production, plus an anime version, and on and on.The book itself is sentimental and sloppy, although interesting in the way it portrays hardship and deprivation. Its mediocrity makes mysterious its continued cultural dominance. Somehow the version adapted and directed by Greta Gerwig ramps up the sentimentality and strips the story of anything of interest. In her version, poverty looks glamorous, advocacy means just having the right opinions, and there are no consequences for anyone’s actions. At one point, I slid so far down in my chair to avoid looking at the screen and the incredibly painful things that were happening – painful to me, not to the characters – that I was nearly sitting on the floor.But if you insist that a movie is important, you don’t really have to deal with whether or not it’s good. You can shame people into seeing it as a political statement, rather than as an entertainment or cultural selection. Same with the “dangerous” or “disturbing” moniker, which got used on everything from Joker to the latest Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, which was marked down for everything from not giving its female co-star Margot Robbie enough lines to its gratuitous violence against a female would-be murderer to its filming of women’s feet (fetishes are now dangerous, I guess). If a critic doesn’t like a film, labeling it as dangerous – and implying you might get killed if you go see it – is an attempt to keep people away.Part of this language is the result of our commenting culture choosing to see everything through a political lens. There must be a political reason for Tarantino giving so few lines to a female actor in his latest film, and that political reason must be he does not respect or have any interest in women. There must be a political reason this movie doesn’t have the correct number of roles given to actors of color, and that reason must be that the director is racist. Even the female director of a terrible Charlie’s Angels reboot tried to blame the audience’s lack of interest in “women’s stories” for its failure. You know, just the totally normal and relatable stories of regular women fighting crime in very short shorts.But another reason for this rhetorical madness is the loss of authority the average cultural critic has with the movie-going audience. There’s always been a ide between what the critical culture celebrates and what audience members actually want to see. “This three-and-a-half-hour Turkish film about the struggle between a boy and his father is a heartrending exploration of generational ides among a swiftly changing world …” “I don’t know, does anything blow up?” But that ide seems to be growing, with almost no living critic able to wield the kind of power figures like Siskel and Ebert used to have to get butts in seats, even so-called difficult films or subtitled films or art films. Not only to make an audience show up, but to increase demand enough that distributors increased the number of screens a film like My Dinner with Andre might be shown on.Now no one really cares what a random freelancer at Vulture really thinks about a movie, so critics compete to use the most hyperbolic language possible to attract attention. “Adam Sandler is God-Level” in Uncut Gems, screeched a critic I’ve never heard of at ScreenCrush. “The cinematic equivalent of mixing cocaine with acid.” “The year’s most exciting film.” And of course there are multiple political takes, telling us how important it is for us to see it so we can better understand something about capitalism. And you know what? It was pretty good. Adam Sandler was pretty good in it. I was bored for most of it, and angry for having had high hopes for this film by all of the ravishing critical praise, but yeah I guess it was pretty good, all things considered. Nothing more than that. Other movies that had been called transformative and perfect and so important this year included Us, Midsommar, and the HBO show Watchmen, all of which also had significant gaps between the critics scores and the audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes.But browbeating audience members into seeing films by telling them it’s politically important or by swearing this is the most intense and perfect cinematic experience they’ll ever have doesn’t really work, and it only helps their authority slip further away. And while there are political ramifications to our entertainment – whose stories get told and whose do not is a political issue – the issue is not with the audience but a broken system of film production and distribution, a disappearance of a significant proportion of film history from streaming services, and a lack of good critical writing that helps deepen an audience member’s intellectual engagement with what they are watching.“Morals don’t sell nowadays,” a mean old male publisher tells poor little Jo March in Little Women as he decimates her short story before publishing it. I wish film critics would understand that is still true. The year before, in 2018, it was Black Panther we all “had to see”, for political reasons, of course. Its success was heralded as a political victory, not only for its black cast and director, but for all of humanity.Saudi Arabia has been showing Black Panther in its theaters, too – the first commercially released film to be screened in almost 35 years in this repressive, autocratic regime. And that’s a political victory too. For the repressive, autocratic regime, of course. Because as revolutionary as Black Panther was hailed as being in America, it is ultimately the story of a monarchy triumphing over the challenge presented by a rebellious force. It turns out that it makes for good propaganda for the Saudi monarchy. Oh, the irony."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d27ae32668c426dd911b376845b13ce465ccc9cd/0_301_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7949c61cadb8936642f78f0417df2288","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of peace","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘peace’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘peace’.Share your photos of what peace means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 15 January at 10am.

Neubauer had hoped to persuade Kaeser to withdraw from the project, for which Siemens has won an €18m contract to provide the rail infrastructure.At the meeting in Berlin, Neubauer was offered a position by Kaeser in either the supervisory board or leadership council of Siemens Energy, a spin-off business which hopes to head a new generation of energy-efficient technology and is expected to go public in September on Germany’s Dax index. It is due to split from the main company in the spring.The Carmichael mine was approved by the Austalian government in June and will be run by the the Indian company Adani. It has become a cause for climate protesters who disapprove of a project which will contribute to global heating – especially at a time when large parts of Australia are already being wracked by bush fires blamed on the climate crisis.Kaeser, who has made much of the company’s pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030, last month tweeted his recognition of the activists’ complaints about the mine, promising he would “diligently look into the matter” and “get back” to the protesters. He pointed out a decision would “not be easy” due to the various interest groups involved, including shareholders, customers and the public.But on Sunday, following an extraordinary meeting of Siemens management, Kaeser announced the company was to go ahead with the project as it was legally obliged to remain committed to it, adding that at the same time it would become increasingly watchful of environmental concerns.“We have evaluated all the options and have concluded that we must fulfil our contractual obligations,” he tweeted. He promised the company would improve its future management of “protecting the environment” by establishing what he called “an effective Sustainability Board”.Activists say the coal mine project will produce an annual 27.5m  tonnes of coal and will contribute to global heating. They also point to the vast amounts of water it will require, as well as destruction of habitat and the need to transport the coal via the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef in the world.The Australian Conservation Foundation called the decision “disastrous”, and pledged to continue its protests against the mine. It added: “With this decision, the company is showing its true face ... its climate change strategies have been revealed to be meaningless and hollow.”Neubauer has referred to the Siemens’ project as an “inexcusable mistake”.She told the news agency DPA: “We asked Kaeser to do everything possible to stop the Adani mine. Instead he will now profit from this disastrous project.“This is so last century, and Joe Kaeser is making an unforgivable mistake,” she added, emphasising that Siemens’ decision threatened climate goals to reduce the rise in global warming by two degrees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/096f81ff5d92641459d5e2aa3eda7bc9d40d9974/0_331_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36b9e2cc685ddf03b1001c34d482c467","title":"just one new onshore windfarm started up in uk in 2019","story":"Rollout of new turbines is in decline amid Tory subsidy cuts, jeopardising climate targetsThe government’s current energy policies led to just one new onshore windfarm last year, raising fears that the UK may fall short of the renewable energy it needs to generate to meet its climate targets.Industry figures show the rollout of new onshore windfarms has fallen into sharp decline after the government scrapped subsidy schemes four years ago.According to official data from the Renewable UK trade association, 23 new onshore windfarms began generating clean electricity for the UK last year, but all but one of them had secured support from subsidy schemes before they were closed. Last year’s total was a fraction of the 2014 peak when more than 400 new onshore wind projects began generating clean power for the first time. The 2019 figures are also well below the average set over the last decade of 208 new projects a year. Renewable UK warned that the UK risked falling short of its aim of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 as the pipeline of projects that clinched support before the schemes were closed begins to run dry.Rebecca Williams, a director at Renewable UK, said the figures showed that the government’s current approach was falling short on the clean electricity needed to meet the UK’s legally binding climate targets.“This is a flashing red warning light on our net zero dashboard and we urgently need a new strategy from government,” she said.The findings are likely to increase pressure on the government to reverse the block on government support for new onshore windfarms, put in place by the former Tory prime minister David Cameron in 2016.The current energy policy blocks onshore wind developers from competing for support contracts, and has caused the rollout of new onshore wind capacity to fall to 629 megawatts (MW) last year, or a quarter of the onshore wind growth recorded two years ago.The government’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has suggested that the UK’s onshore wind capacity should increase by almost threefold in the next 15 years to meet climate goals at low cost.This would require the UK to grow its onshore wind capacity from 13,000 MW now to 35,000 MW by 2035, or an average of more that 1,400MW a year.The sole addition to the UK’s fleet of onshore wind farms under the government’s current energy policy last year – the Withernwick II project, in the East Riding of Yorkshire – has a capacity of 8MW, with just four turbines.ScottishPower, a major developer of renewable energy, has started planning for a major expansion of onshore windfarm projects across Scotland in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects.Lindsay McQuade, the chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, told the  late last year that “if the commitment of net zero is to be a reality, I expect to see support from government to match it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb2435d607511ab9db581988603891bea293057/0_45_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f1a8e3d49d67e0b856cfc6b6c874347","title":"un draft plan sets 2030 target to avert earths sixth mass extinction aoe","story":"Paris-style proposal to counter loss of ecosystems and wildlife vital to the future of humanity will go before October summitAlmost a third of the world’s oceans and land should be protected by the end of the decade to stop and reverse bioersity decline that risks the survival of humanity, according to a draft Paris-style UN agreement on nature.To combat what scientists have described as the sixth mass extinction event in Earth’s history, the proposal sets a 2030 deadline for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and wildlife that perform crucial services for humans.The text, drafted by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, is expected to be adopted by governments in October at a crucial UN summit in the Chinese city of Kunming. It comes after countries largely failed to meet targets for the previous decade agreed in Aichi, Japan, in 2010.The draft text has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have called on governments to treat the targets outlined in the accord as the minimum acceptable level for which to aim.The director of Campaign for Nature, Brian O’Donnell, said: “Today’s draft shows that countries are listening and that they recognise the increasingly important role that protecting land and water must play in confronting climate change, preventing wildlife extinctions, and supporting people and local communities. This is a very encouraging first step.“Much work remains to be done in the coming months to ensure that the rights of indigenous people are advanced, and bold conservation and finance targets are included in the final agreement.”By 2030, the trade in wild species must be legal and sustainable, according to the draft document, which also aims to promote the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities in decision-making about bioersity.Bioersity\u0026nbspis the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. \u0026nbsp“Without bioersity, there is no future for humanity,” says Prof David Macdonald, at Oxford University. It is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then inidual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment.\u0026nbspThe extinction rate of species is now thought to be about\u0026nbsp1,000 times higher\u0026nbspthan before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the\u0026nbsplosses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs\u0026nbsp65m years ago. The\u0026nbspsixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun, according to some scientists. Billions of inidual populations have been lost, with the number of animals living on Earth having\u0026nbspplunged by half since 1970. Researchers call the\u0026nbspmassive loss of wildlife\u0026nbspa “biological annihilation”.\u0026nbspForest felling is often the first step and 30m hectares – the area of the Britain and Ireland – were lost globally in 2016. Poaching and unsustainable hunting for food is another major factor. Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia – but once species become extinct, there’s no going back.The planned agreement forms part of a long-term international framework that aims to ensure bioersity is sustainably valued and conserved by 2050.“But this is the floor, not the ceiling. Now every government on Earth must get behind this bold mission and drive through a global agreement for nature this year.”In May, the world’s leading scientists warned that nature is being destroyed at a rate up to hundreds of times higher than the average for the previous 10 million years, due to human activity.The destruction of the planet’s coral reefs, rainforests and other vital ecosystems have placed human society in jeopardy, with the report’s authors warning of “ominous” consequences such as freshwater shortages and climate instability unless radical action is taken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10e8d030bc67ccda24c3414b50c24ce0631a7a50/0_0_10410_6250/master/10410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dbb41feb5e4ebe03defc6ab3c9889ff","title":"oscars 2020 nominations joker irishman","story":"Less than a week since Bafta’s strikingly white and male awards shortlist met with widespread criticism – including from the organisation’s own chief executive – the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has released a set of nominations whose small concessions to ersity seem striking by contrast.Cynthia Erivo is nominated for best actress for her role in a biopic of abolitionist Harriet Tubman, and Parasite – Bong Joon-ho’s acclaimed South Korean black comedy – is up for six awards, including best director and best picture.Little Women, Greta Gerwig’s so-far-overlooked take on the Louisa May Alcott classic, also scored six nominations, including best picture and best adapted screenplay – but Gerwig was locked out of the all-male best director shortlist.Such moves are likely to be just about sufficient to insulate the Academy from the worst of the anger that greeted Bafta’s equivalent announcement last Tuesday, where its members snubbed all non-white acting nominees, as well as homegrown talent such as Rapman and Joanna Hogg, and credited Joker – Todd Phillips’s Batman origins story – with the most nods.However, many commentators expressed distaste at many of Monday’s omissions – in particular the lack of recognition in the best actress category for Lupita Nyong’o, star of Jordan Peele’s horror movie, Us and for Awkwafina, the lead in The Farewell. The complete exclusion of Lulu Wang’s much-admired female-centric Chinese-American drama does little to boost the Academy’s inclusivity credentials.“In the past, the pushback against #OscarsSoWhite was, ‘There just weren’t enough performances to nominate,’” said April Reign, the activist who created the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag in 2015.“Well, that’s not the case this year. There was a wealth of talent — and not just of black performers but of various marginalised communities — that was overlooked. And it’s really unfortunate.”Joker is also the nominee to beat at the Oscars this year, where it likewise goes into the race with 11 nominations, including best picture, best director and best actor for Joaquin Phoenix.It is only the second comic-book movie to land a best picture nomination, following Black Panther in 2018. Nine years before, Christopher Nolan’s Gotham-set The Dark Knight was snubbed for best picture – a move that many felt damagingly highlighted the ergent tastes of Oscar voters and paying audiences.Some saw Joker’s position on the top of the pile as further evidence of an endemic misogyny in the film industry, however. Said Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood: “You don’t have to look further that the movies nominated for the most Oscars this year to realize how white boy centric Hollywood is. A war movie, a mob movie and movie about an incel. Why we continue to glorify these stories over and over again is the crux of the problem.”Coming in with 10 nominations are Sam Mendes’s first world war thriller 1917, Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to 60s LA, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Martin Scorsese’s wintry mob epic, The Irishman.Netflix, the studio responsible for that film, came away with 24 nominations from Monday’s announcement: leading the pack for the first time, but still fewer than anticipated, because of the complete lack of nods for Dolemite Is My Name and slightly underwhelming totals for Marriage Story and The Two Popes.Disney picked up 23 nominations, while Sony – whose slate last year included Once Upon a Time in Hollywood – took 20.Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach’s orce drama, ended up with six nominations, including for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Johansson’s role in Jojo Rabbit means she will also be in the running in the best supporting actress race this year – although Laura Dern’s turn as her cynical lawyer in Marriage Story makes her the favourite.Little Women’s Florence Pugh, Richard Jewell’s Kathy Bates and Margot Robbie (for Bombshell, costing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood a key nod) round out the category – leaving Jennifer Lopez unrecognised for her pole-dancing turn in Hustlers.Meanwhile, The Irishman’s Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, plus Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, whose part in Tarantino’s film has earned him some career-best notices, compete for supporting actor.Phoenix is the man to beat for leading actor, having taken the lion’s share of awards so far for his transformative performance in Joker. He is up against Driver, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonathan Pryce (for The Two Popes) and Pain and Glory’s Antonio Banderas.Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler failed to capitalise on prodigious buzz for Dolemite Is My Name and Uncut Gems, respectively – and Robert De Niro’s leading role in The Irishman again failed to win over first-round voters. Taron Egerton’s Golden Globe win on Sunday for his Elton John in Rocketman did not in the end convert to an Oscar nomination.Another apparent lock-in leads the best actress nominations: Renée Zellweger, whose turn as Judy Garland in last year’s biopic has won over critics and voters in other awards bodies alike. Competing against her, Johansson and Erivo are Little Women’s Saoirse Ronan and Bombshell’s Charlize Theron.Last year’s Oscars won much praise for handing out four trophies – including best director – to Alfonso Cuaron’s Spanish-language, black-and-white story of a domestic servant, Roma praise tempered by the eventual victory of reductive interracial road movie Green Book for best picture.This year, second-round voters have the chance to repeat the trick by honouring a foreign-language film in categories other than best international film: Parasite – which tells of an impoverished family infiltrating the lives of a wealthy household – is also up for best film, best director, best original screenplay, best editing and best production design.The Baftas announcement last week led to such a backlash that the awards body promised a major review of its voting procedures. Speaking to the , Steve McQueen – a Bafta and Oscar winner for 12 Years a Slave – said the organisation risked cultural redundancy without urgent change.Both the Baftas and Oscars have undertaken membership shakeups over the past five years in a bid to better reflect the ersity of both films and the wider world.In 2016, the Oscars announced an intention to double their number of female and minority voters by 2020 a goal that appears to have been achieved by enormous drafts of fresh members, including 842 new faces in 2019 – and, more controversially, taking voting privileges away from “dormant” members."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca92769e1c6347e98ef998bb7a0995cf9dfdb06/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe39573133eee7a42dbc90619d4c2257","title":"oscars 2020 shallow joker squats on top of patchy and infuriating nominations","story":"The supervillain origin story has again squeezed out a clutch of much better films, but this isn’t the shabbiest shortlist I’ve seen•Oscar nominations: full list for 2020The Oscar nominations arrive, signalling almost the final iteration of that strange awardsthink consensus: at once exasperating and eerie, choices which somehow emerge as if from a single head. The raucous box-office smash Joker, the origins story for Batman’s arch-villain, leads the field with 11 nominations, and 10 each for Sam Mendes’s first world war spectacular 1917, Martin Scorsese’s wintry mob drama The Irishman and Quentin Tarantino’s LA black comedy Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Once again, we have an all-male directing shortlist (with nothing for Greta Gerwig’s superlative Little Women or Marielle Heller for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood), and only Cynthia Erivo making the list as a non-white actor, with nothing for Lupita Nyong’o’s much-admired performance in Jordan Peele’s Us.It is infuriating, too, that the Safdie brothers’ glorious crime drama Uncut Gems did not make the cut Taron Egerton must be disappointed to get nothing for his game impersonation of Elton John in Rocketman (although it was always a better singing than acting performance) and Awkwafina certainly should have been included. This Academy Awards list is duller without her.There is a lot to feel good about in #Oscars2020: Cats didn’t figure, and all three films in the silver medal “10 nominations” position, 1917, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman are absolutely superb. Each in their various ways sparkle with ingenuity, flair, thrills, audacity and humanity. It is very good to see Bong Joon Ho’s smart satire Parasite from South Korea doing so well, though here again – at the risk of heresy – I have to raise an eyebrow at the way this film, like Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite last year, has snared the excitable “connoisseur talking point” vote. Other international films like Wang Xiaoshwai’s So Long, My Son and Kantemir Balagov’s Beanpole simply haven’t shown up on the Oscar radar.But squatting on everything is Joker: in my view, a mediocre and overrated film which runs out of story ideas after the first act and which has less interest than the viral video of the Portsmouth kebab shop fight. It certainly deserves its cinematography nomination for Laurence Sher (but bizarrely, it got nothing for the excellent production design by Mark Friedberg). But almost everything else about it is meagre and shallow, and the strident lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix is much less interesting than similar portrayals in You Were Never Really Here and The Master.Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, for all that it is arguably self-indulgent and provocative, at least has the courage of its bizarre counter-factual convictions it maintains a story momentum up to and including its delirious and stomach-turning finale and it is passionately engaged with its time and place, and with cinema itself. Mendes’s amazingly bold single-shot rendering of a story on the western front has now been out long enough for its technical expertise to be somehow held against it in some quarters the fact that at key moments the screen fades to black is held somehow to invalidate the single-shot effect. For me the going down into darkness and then up into light is a vital part of its vision. It is a shattering experience.There has also been a backlash of sorts to The Irishman, to the effect that we shouldn’t take Frank Sheeran claims about his role in the disappearance of Teamsters’ boss Jimmy Hoffa at face value. I agree. We shouldn’t. But that doesn’t detract from the personal story that it has to tell, and the power and substance of this late-period, minor-key symphony of a movie, with its great alpha-performances from Joe Pesci and Al Pacino – though, again, I am a bit surprised to see nothing for De Niro himself as Sheeran.There are some notable acting nominations here: a double for Scarlett Johansson, who gets a thoroughly deserved best actress nomination for her appearance in Noah Baumbach’s utterly delectable orce tragicomedy Marriage Story. But worryingly, she gets a best supporting actress nod for her middling performance in the awful second world war romp Jojo Rabbit – and again, I have to restate my refusenik status for this fatuous, misjudged, tone-deaf piece of work which is all the more baffling as its creator Taika Waititi has done such genuinely great stuff in the past. As with Joker, however, I have to say it is a lot more more intelligent than its Twitter fantrolls.I’m hoping that Gerwig’s rich, warm, generous Little Women will upset the apple-cart and win the best picture Oscar, but it’s a long shot. In the best actor list, perhaps Antonio Banderas will sneak through the middle and get it for his wonderfully witty and mature performance in Almodovar’s Pain and Glory. In the best supporting actor category, I think Joe Pesci will pinch it for his subtle portrayal of mob fixer Russell Bufalino — although fellow nominee Tom Hanks has a huge fanbase for his appearance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.

I put my hand up into the lemony air. A young man near me did not: he simply shot out his question like a bullet, and it was the same question as mine. Corrado noticed, but I turned my keen arm into a “it’s fine” wave, so he answered the man, ending with thanks for a good question, before turning back to me. Acknowledging that my question had been answered would have been the sensible thing to do, but petty rage isn’t sensible. Being sensible also felt like giving the upper hand to the usurper, so I grabbed a thought: “What is your comfort food?” translating it as it came out of my mouth (cos’e il tuo comfort cibo?).Not only did the question feel wrong and twee, it was also a bad translation that didn’t make any sense. Even if I had got it right (qual è il tuo cibo di conforto?), it doesn’t have quite the same meaning. The situation was further confused when someone else asked if I meant comfort in terms of comodità, as in “convenient” or “easy”. Fortunately, Corrado understood what I was getting at it depended on when I asked him, he said: “Different moments called for completely different sorts of comfort.” He also suggested that maybe the reason there is no need for the term comfort food in Italian is because the words are one and the same: food is comfort.Maybe it’s because there was a time when it wasn’t. I think of Corrado and the idea that “food is comfort” often. Mostly with the predictable things: mashed or baked potatoes pasta with sauce and cheese baked fruit tomatoes on bread a moon of watermelon eaten in the sea the cricket ball-sized arancine filled with ragu bechamel and peas we buy from the bar near the port of Palermo, all of them a little homecoming.But more than the predictable are the other things: the apple I always eat on the way to pick up my son from school the Polo mint I suck before any sort of interview the hard-boiled egg I buy from M\u0026ampS when I arrive at Gatwick, which often gives me heartburn, discomfort-comfort. Writing about the mysterious appetites of grief in her essay S is for Sad (in An Alphabet for Gourmets), the American food writer MFK Fisher notes: “It is as if our bodies, wiser than we who wear them, call out for encouragement and strength … to eat.” I am not comparing an interview to grief, but in that moment, the little Polo clinking beneath my teeth like a mint ceramic is encouragement and strength. It is also familiar.Food is comfort for me when it is dependable when I know what is coming: the apple, the egg, doughnuts for breakfast on a Saturday, and fried potatoes and eggs on a Monday. Today’s dish isn’t really a recipe rather, it is a way with a kilo of potatoes and four eggs, and one of my favourite things to eat with anyone, but especially just the three of us at this time of year.I must end by noting that I have debated quite seriously with my partner Vincenzo for 11 years about cooking the potatoes, before admitting his way – uncovered, covered and then uncovered – is best, giving our comfort crisp edges.Olive oil1.2kg potatoes, peeled and cut into roughly 1cm cubes (you don’t need to be too precise)SaltLeaves from 1 rosemary stalk4 large eggsPour some olive oil into a frying pan – seven tablespoons as a guide – then tip in the potatoes along with a good pinch of salt, and put over a medium flame.Cook for about three minutes, tossing the cubes around until they are coated with oil, then reduce the flame to low and cover with a lid. Leave the potatoes to cook gently, shaking the pan a couple of times, for 15 minutes, in which time they will steam, braise and almost cook through.Uncover, add the rosemary and raise the heat. As the potatoes are almost cooked, this stage is all about crisping, so fry for 10 minutes, stirring often to brown all sides.Push the potatoes aside to create four small hollows, break the eggs into the hollows and fry until done. Serve immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c1cec5095f67034f24720ab57445225987be84b/0_1081_5683_3409/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d871f43441825c7d52fdc709d3bee01","title":"macaroni cheese with kale and crisp breadcrumbs recipe thomasina miers","story":"You’ll never go back to ordinary macaroni cheese after making this version, oozing with a deeply cheesy flavour and crowned with a crisp crustI never really understood the appeal of macaroni cheese, a stodgy dish tasting of pasta and not much else, until I went to a neighbour’s fireworks display last year.

Besides, someone somewhere had to act with a little dignity. And what if it didn’t happen? He certainly wasn’t about to make the decision for them, so Ernesto Valverde drove into San Joan Despí not long after 8am. At 11, he was out on the training pitch as normal, players gathered in a circle around him, which was one way to say: “goodbye … probably.” By the time he drove out again, he knew, it was likely to be for the last time. But not because they had actually told him.On Thursday night, Valverde’s team had collapsed again. While they played better than they had so far this season, he got booed every time he appeared on the big screen. 2-1 up with nine minutes remaining against Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah, Barcelona lost 3-2: echoes of Rome and Anfield, that recurring nightmare. Three times was too many. Two already had been, but to almost everyone’s surprise, the club didn’t act in the summer, instead keeping their coach. They did act now, just not particularly well. “A bit ugly,” was Andrés Iniesta’s verdict “unpleasant,” he called it.Valverde has a contract until the end of the season with an option for another year that no one anticipated activating. Barcelona are top of the league, where they finished the last two seasons, but as Pep Guardiola put it: “It’s a special place where winning the league is not enough.” And here’s the truth, which may feel odd outside Spain but feels entirely logical inside it: no one was suggesting he should continue beyond this season. Regardless of who they blamed, most thought he should not have got to this season: Anfield was The End. Yet, having survived until now, supported by his players and useful for his president, logic said he would get to that point.He still could, perhaps – and, yes, at this point, these pages are waiting too. But how, after this pantomime played out in public? An operetta, El Mundo called it.Saudi Arabia had stung. It prompted an urge to do something, anything, and to be seen to do it, not to wait any longer. July was a long way away and this hurt now. There was regret, too, that they hadn’t acted sooner. The timing limited their room for manoeuvre, but at least there were 10 days until their next game. What happened next was open, broadcast: Barcelona’s CEO, Óscar Grau, and sporting director, Eric Abidal, met Xavi Hernández in Qatar. They were in a hurry and needed a response soon. To his surprise, they offered him the job they know he wants in the future with immediate effect to their surprise, he said no.Aligned with Víctor Font who will stand in presidential elections in two years, Xavi does not entirely trust these directors. The timing wasn’t right, he felt. Ronald Koeman, whose position has always been to make himself available after the Euros, an appointment considered a fait accompli, felt the same way when they went back to him with a new chronology. And so, on it went. Still, no one had said anything to Valverde, but he had read all about it.Things could never be the same again, even if they did try to turn back, carry on regardless, pretend nothing had happened, use the old trick of blaming it on the press. This couldn’t be normalised now, however much Valverde was out there carrying on like normal however much that character has been central to his success at Barcelona – if it can be called that. And, for all the complaints and the criticism, it can.The summer he arrived, Neymar left, the succession plan in pieces. “For the first time in nine years, I feel inferior to Madrid,” Gerard Piqué admitted. The best players were getting older and that team had gone, even if some of its members remained, diminished in some cases. Some were indulged from above, although Valverde too stood accused of the same: dressing room support is a virtue easily turned into a vice. For all that, Barcelona won two league titles, miles ahead. They forfeited an historic invincible season because a friendly, imposed by the board, took precedence over their penultimate game.But if he was perfect in a crisis, creation was something else, especially when his authority and room for manoeuvre was reduced there were things that he could change and things he could not and did not. At a club occupied by identity but seemingly without the conviction to impose it from above, with that famous “entourage”, results are not enough. Not when you have Messi, whose final years can sometimes feel wasted. Expectation was perhaps exaggerated but excellence eluded them. The results they really wanted were not enough either. And Rome and Liverpool happened. Now this did. It was absurd that defeat on Thursday should start this but once it had, it was not easy to stop.As Valverde took training on Monday, so the candidates circled, some seemingly thrown into the air at random. You name them, someone else had named them. This ran and ran, information and rumour intertwined. Some of it sounded absurd, but then ... no Xavi, no Koeman, so on to Massimiliano Allegri, Roberto Martínez, and Quique Setién. Gabriel Milito, Thierry Henry, and Marcelo Gallardo. Mauricio Pochettino, who had said he would sooner work on a farm than manage Barcelona. Francisco Javier García Pimineta, the B team manager. For now, at least. And then, well, we’ll see.Josep Maria Bartomeu’s car arrived. Valverde’s agent arrived. After training, president and coach – still – met. There was no news, not immediately. Maybe Bartomeu had expected Valverde to resign. Hurt, humiliated, exposed, he would act. On a point of principle, he would walk, tell them where to go. Maybe that’s what Bartomeu hoped it would have made it easier. But he didn’t. Valverde remained Valverde. A board meeting followed and the cars were followed too, endless photos of men at the wheel and a lingering feeling that no one was. At three o’clock the meeting began, but with no announcement over when it would end, when any of it would.It was mid-afternoon on Monday, Barcelona’s ex-manager was still their manager and everybody was waiting for the final line of chronicle of a death foretold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e684ff17d6c9d28bdcbbd789229a6f6baacfe6a/50_201_5337_3204/master/5337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=127b73e2b04b04fcfee077b152a10225","title":"harry kane injury euro 2020 jose mourinho tottenham england","story":"José Mourinho has cast doubt on whether Harry Kane will be available again this season or for Euro 2020, suggesting he may not return from hamstring surgery until the 2020-21 campaign has begun.Kane had an operation on Saturday to repair a ruptured tendon in his left hamstring, which he sustained in Spurs’ defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day. He posted a picture on social media in which he was watching his teammates play Liverpool from a hospital bed, writing: “Surgery went very well. First day of recovery starts now!”Spurs had expected Kane to return to full training in April but, asked if there was any update on the timeframe, Mourinho suggested the process may not be as quick as initially hoped. “We try the best we can,” he said. “News on Harry we don’t have, and if you ask me every time we come here the answer will be the same. We expect him to be out until mid-April, end of April, May, next season, I don’t know.”That is the first time any suggestion has been raised that Kane’s injury will end his season, and any absence significantly beyond April would put his readiness for England’s Euro 2020 campaign in serious doubt.Mourinho is desperate to strengthen a Tottenham squad that, as he stressed repeatedly during his press conference lunchtime, is short on numbers. But he would not confirm that an 18-month loan deal for the Benfica midfielder Gedson Fernandes has been agreed. Spurs look certain to pip West Ham to his signature but Mourinho will in any case not have services for the FA Cup third-round replay at home against Middlesbrough on Tuesday.“I am waiting for news, but when I say I am waiting news can come or not,” he said. “I am more worried about Middlesbrough than the market. With the rules, even if we get the player you cannot play him in a replay so in this moment I am not interested in Gedson or any other players who could come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/147e699eb103ad364f0b73b384839a9ae3e0c0be/0_433_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42c03739a3d2c63a65cc3155e1bfb2ff","title":"runaway reds aguero records and barcelona football weekly podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Barney Ronay and Philippe Auclair discuss Liverpool’s continued dominance, Sergio Agüero breaking records, tackles late, hard or a combination of the two, Bielsa and AVBJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

They are now married and live in MyanmarWhen Ebola swept through west Africa in 2014, many foreign workers were evacuated from the region. For Rachel, who had been working on an educational development project in Liberia, being sent home to Britain was frustrating. “I really wanted to support colleagues. I felt so helpless.”In early 2015, she was given the all-clear to head back to the city of Monrovia. “I was meant to be meeting a friend for dinner and she told me she was bringing her new colleague, Stephen,” she says. After a tough few weeks, Rachel wasn’t in the mood to meet new people. “Plus, she’d heard I was American,” says Stephen, with a smile. “The worst.”But the pair spent the whole evening laughing. “I was working for an NGO at the time and doing work for the ministry of health,” says Stephen. “It’s an intense environment out there, but we were being silly and joking around.”Over the next few weeks, the pair grew closer as they organised events to distract their friends from the health crisis. “It was a tough time, so we needed some escapism,” explains Rachel. “We started the Monday movie club and spent more time together.”After two months, the pair took the first step towards something more serious.“He took me on a surprise date, but he needed me to drive there,” Rachel says. Stephen adds: “I think we were both nervous in the car. If something went wrong, it would have been a very awkward drive home.”When they arrived at their destination – a park with a golf course – they sat down for a picnic. “It was such a lovely day – like no date I’d ever been on before,” she says. “Although we did have to dodge a few golf balls.”Two weeks later, they were living together. “We hardly spent a night apart from then on,” says Rachel.That year, they travelled to Stephen’s home in Pennsylvania for Thanksgiving, followed by a trip to Scotland for Christmas with Rachel’s family. In August 2016, they moved to the north of England to study for their master’s degrees. “I went to Leeds University,” Stephen says. “Rachel went to Durham and we lived in York. It’s a beautiful place.”During their year in the UK, they got engaged. “We were on a country walk in Scotland and I proposed with two rings I’d brought back from Liberia,” says Rachel. For Stephen, it was a lovely surprise, although he admits it took him a while to cotton on. “She was holding the rings behind me in a selfie and I didn’t spot them at first. When I realised, it was amazing. We basically pranced back down the hill.” Rachel says she planned the proposal because she had always wanted an “equal partnership”.The pair married in the US in December 2017, before moving to Myanmar. “Stephen is now working with the same NGO, on malaria elimination, and I’m an international development consultant here,” Rachel says. When they are not busy with work, they enjoy cooking in their home in Yangon. “Going to markets and getting creative in the kitchen is something we love,” says Stephen. “I cook the basics and Rachel does all the details. I call her the spice to my rice.”Rachel says she loves the way her husband treats everyone with respect. “He’s also very open about his feelings. As a Brit, it was quite overwhelming at first, but I love that he has helped me to talk more and open up.” Stephen has always been there for her. “In 2016, I was caught up in the Brussels terror attacks. I felt so supported by him. Any difficulties we have faced have only made us stronger.”“Rachel makes everyone in her life feel special,” Stephen says. “She is so inspiring to me and I love her positive energy. She is like no one else I have ever met.” At some point, they want to start a family, but for now they are just happy to be together. “I’m from the US and Rachel is from the UK, so the most important thing is that we are able to live in the same country,” Stephen says. “We’re excited about all the adventures to come.”• Want to share your story?

Which poses the question: what have I stopped doing that once made me, me?About six years ago I started having panic attacks. I began my journey to crack them with traditional tools, including therapy, keeping active, meditation and medication, all of which were a great help. Thankfully, a year later medication was no longer needed and neither was therapy. Problem solved.Frustratingly, about a year after that, when I was seemingly happy and healthy, I started to develop depression and began to have panic attacks once again, and this time they were far more debilitating. I tried what I knew best and went back to my previous toolkit, but I was still struggling and far from feeling well again. Until I got some new advice.My childhood had been filled with creativity. School and, later, university burst at the seams with music, art and dancing, yet for most of my adult life these outlets had been neglected. A therapist I had been seeing told me that mental health issues are incredibly common among the creative minds of the world, the so-called “tortured artist” no surprises there. Yet what we explored was the opposite: what happens when your creativity is suppressed, when you hold back an energy that is ingrained in you? I began to wonder if part of my mental health struggles could be due to the neglect of my creativity: dormant self-expression going nowhere and morphing into anxiety.I love to sing and, when I was younger, I did what a lot of teens did in the 90s: formed a band, learned every Spice Girls routine out there and performed them at school assembly (or the occasional after-school concert with our soon-to-be-famous signatures on the back of each ticket). To rekindle my creative side, I decided to get back into singing and audition for every top established Renaissance chamber choir. Not very Spice Girls. Not so smart.Then I discovered a group called Sound, a pop, funk and soul choir that sings the likes of Beyoncé, Janelle Monáe and Queen. Much better. And in what was a particularly dark patch for me, I found the courage to audition. I was amazed that I managed to put myself through such a high-stakes situation and not have a panic attack. The audition itself was a win for me, never mind how I did.I remember clearly the day I got the email saying they would love me to join them. I was on the top deck of a bus and let out a loud squeal of jubilation. I could not stop smiling to myself for the rest of the journey. It meant a lot.I have now been a member of the choir for three years, rehearsing every Tuesday. I love the community, the challenge, the performances and the fire it lights in my belly. It reminds me of who I was at school. My path back then was always “do what you love and do what you’re good at”. I studied dance because I loved it and sang because I loved it, and my entire education was filled with fond memories because of that, and I was now starting to build that back into my adult life.Although my job is in the creative industry, the day-to-day skills I use are not so I have had to learn the importance of finding time to include creativity in my life. I sing, go to dance classes and make my own Christmas cards. I fear that if these creative outlets stagnate I may relapse and if keeping healthy means doing things I love all the time, I am certainly not going to complain.My anxiety attacks came out of nowhere and, to this day, I am still clueless as to what sets them off. Now, though, I am feeling a lot better. When I am anxious, distraction is key and singing does exactly that. It sends me into autopilot, a state in which my body works without instruction, but with pure passion and joy – a meditative state.Don’t get me wrong, there are weeks when the last thing I want to do after work is go to choir practice and I long to go home to bed. But I go because I know I am guaranteed to come out feeling great. I will leave having loved every second, learned something new and progressed my vocal skills. More importantly, I will have exercised my creativity and held my anxiety at bay. What more could I ask for?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656a0ded9a25cfeebd1cfe121e10cb28c4f7485c/0_201_5415_3249/master/5415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb824fd3b531af89242c6be1ac05703d","title":"city access eu markets eu fleets uk fishing rights brexit","story":"Commissioner says Europe will seek fishery access and UK will want concessions for CityThe EU’s trade commissioner has suggested there could be a last-minute trade-off with Brussels offering the City of London access to European markets in return for European fleets retaining their fishing rights in British waters.The UK’s financial services sector will lose its automatic right to serve Europe-based clients at the end of the transition period and the EU will need to negotiate access to UK waters for its fishing boats.Phil Hogan, the former Irish minister who is now trade commissioner in Brussels overseeing the next stage of the Brexit negotiations, told the Irish Independent: “There certainly will be trade-offs, particularly at the end of the negotiations. The EU will be seeking concessions on fishery access and the UK will very probably be seeking concessions on financial services.”Hogan, a longstanding critic of prominent Brexiters including Boris Johnson, described claims that the EU would be put under pressure to seal a deal by parallel UK-US negotiations as “fairytale economics”.Negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK after 31 January, the scheduled date for Brexit, are expected to start in early March once both sides have settled positions on the main issues.EU diplomats were presented with the main principles of the free trade agreement on Monday in which “access to waters and quota share for fisheries” would be made “within the context of the economic partnership”.Speaking in Luxembourg on Monday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, reiterated that the British government would also need to sign up to a series of commitments on state aid, environmental and labour standards to allow tariff- and quota-free trade.She said: “Great Britain is our friend, the Brits are our friends, it is a friendship that has been growing for a long time but we have to break new ground with each other, and here it applies as well: it is the decision of Great Britain how close or distant of the biggest single market in the world they want to be.“The closer they are, meaning a level playing field, the more they are ready to respect the European rules, the easier accession to the European single market will be. The further away, the less there is of a level playing field, the more difficult their access to the European single market will be. It is a decision Great Britain has to make and in the negotiations we will have to sound out the scope that we want to use to then determine the negotiations accordingly.”Last week, Andrej Plenković, Croatia’s prime minister, whose country is taking over the presidency of the EU, conceded that Brussels would be unashamedly “political” and could threaten to block the City of London’s access to European markets if Johnson tries to exempt the UK from its laws. He also warned of the risk of skirmishes at sea similar to those during the 1970s cod wars if a deal on fishing rights was not secured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/051a7fce11190421425985fcfea5b6ea7c84cbe2/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01b7e3e0129744c071d596cdb221b99b","title":"clive lewis pulls out of labour leadership race as nominations close","story":"Thornberry joins Long-Bailey, Starmer, Phillips and Nandy on list of leadership hopefulsFive candidates have made it through to the next round of the Labour leadership contest – Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.The leadership hopefuls passed the first hurdle after gaining the nominations of 22 MP and MEP colleagues, with one candidate, Clive Lewis, dropping out in the process.All five candidates for the deputy leadership – Angela Rayner, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray, Richard Burgon and Rosena Allin-Khan – made it through to the next round of the competition.Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was the clear favourite for the leadership among MPs, with 89 nominations, with Rebecca Long-Bailey, the favoured candidate of many Jeremy Corbyn allies, second on 33.Lisa Nandy, who has been critical of the party’s push for a second referendum on Brexit, has 31 supporters, while Jess Phillips, the backbencher and women’s rights campaigner, has 23 backers.Thornberry just made it over the line with minutes to go, after picking up some nominations from MPs who had previously backed Lewis. Like Phillips she has 23 nominations.Lewis, a pro-EU voice on the left of the party, managed to get only five supporters. Withdrawing his candidacy, he said: “At this stage, it’s clear that I won’t get on the ballot. So, I’m standing aside in the spirit of pluralism, ersity and generosity that I’ve promoted throughout this campaign, so that those who have supported me can recast their nominations.”If they manage to get through that round, they will make the final shortlist from which party members, trade union members, members of affiliated societies and registered supporters will choose a winner.Starmer is all but certain to be on the ballot paper as he has the backing of Unison, the UK’s biggest union. Unite, the GMB, Usdaw and CWU are yet to declare who they will back. Momentum, the leftwing grassroots campaign group, has decided to back Long-Bailey.In the deputy leadership contest, Rayner was far out in front with 88 nominations, while Murray had 34 and Butler got 29. Allin-Khan had 23 while Burgon just made it over the line with 22.Ed Miliband was among prominent Labour figures to reveal on Monday he was backing the frontrunners, Starmer and Rayner.Speaking on LBC, Phillips said she would like Nandy to win if she was not successful herself and backed Murray for deputy.The party will soon begin holding a series of hustings across major cities in the UK but some of the candidates spoke out against the decision not to hold events in some regions or smaller towns.“I am disappointed that the party has chosen not to organise leadership and deputy leadership hustings in every Labour party region and nation,” said Starmer.“I am concerned that this decision does not reflect well on the party and will be a step backwards in the whole movement’s determination to take the argument for a radical Labour government back to the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dc4a132164c98d99f2338f8944d956a8f6a8ac7/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bae867b26cdda4ff56c971af28ebfc6","title":"share your thoughts on the labour leadership election","story":"With the candidates now confirmed for the Labour leadership election, we would like to hear your thoughtsThe candidates for the Labour leadership election have been finalised.

One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005664f5d4d6232bcf5bfde2ccabc45e44aa0eac/149_0_4658_2796/master/4658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4109bc03a6e7125984613cf7cb3a11f7","title":"understated beauty great brands have one big idea that chimes with people","story":"For a brand such as Audi, form really does follow function – which translates into designs that instill a sense of reliability, efficiency and trustIt was the audacious simplicity of it. At last year’s Milan Design Week, a giant ring was suspended inside the courtyard of the city’s Seminario Arcivescovile, a seminary that was built in 1564.Ma Yansong, the founder of MAD Architects, which developed the installation with Audi, explained the thinking behind it: “The illuminated ring in the square boundary of the historical courtyard stands for mankind’s strive for perfection.”The installation, called “Fifth Ring”, was arguably a perfect metaphor for a design aesthetic that has long been associated with the German carmaker. The air of quiet confidence. The understated beauty. Its sheer efficiency.But the aesthetic is also a business ethos rendered into physical form.“Audi are an interesting brand in the way they tapped very deliberately into the whole German design aesthetic of engineering efficiency, rationality and modernity,” says Jeremy Myerson, chair of design at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College of Art and founding editor of Design Week. “Those values go back to the Bauhaus roots of good form, everything precisely as it needs to be – and there is still commercial equity in that, as we’ve seen in brands like Apple. The idea is that in a complex world you need simplicity, and that continues to hold its own.”Audi has made a virtue of those principles in its adherence to functionality and to the concept of progress through technology (better known as vorsprung durch technik). It’s a subtle message with a powerful appeal. The beauty of its cars flow from fundamental engineering values that feed into quality and consistency.“Most great brands have one big emotional idea, very simple, very recognisable and it chimes with people,” says Myerson, “You buy an Audi because you’re identifying emotionally in a high quality, technical machine. It instils ideas of reliability and efficiency – trust essentially. And that’s what the best brands are about.”Simplicity should never be mistaken for predictability or dullness. Audi has always been ready to push the envelope, whether it came to the aerodynamics of its iconic 1980s Quattro or the sporty elegance of the TT.“Audi has always been able to be creative within its own defined rules,” says Howard Guy, co-managing director of automotive and aviation consultancy, Design Q. “They were the first manufacturer to start using materials and finishes that play off each other very imaginatively. For instance, the TT dash had a superb grain, a texture and softness which didn’t make it feel like it was a great big injection-moulded piece of plastic like most things at the time. There were little details, a bit of gloss, a bit of brushed aluminium, the way the materials were brought together that was very refreshing and everyone began to copy it. It’s about perception, the way of making something mass market look expensive. It’s clever because it’s about playing with surfaces and colours – things that don’t cost much. It’s the same approach that makes for a great handbag.”Audi’s lesson is one of boldness and confidence in its ability to take materials and technology and synthesise them into something that symbolises progress in an elegantly understated way, whether it be the Audi A8 aluminium Space Frame of the early 1990s or the 1995 TT coupe that has proved so enduring.“The very first TT had the baseball interior with the heavy leather seats with the huge stitching. Nobody had done that before or been bold enough,” says Guy. “They were very sure of their ground. When it came to those great cars, they did it with courage and that’s a disappearing value in the car industry today, there’s so much to lose, everyone plays safe.”The danger of homogeneity must always be set against destroying core values and Audi’s heritage has meant a consistency of approach. It is a premium brand and everything stays as in tune to that as its legendarily reliable engines.Embracing new technology in the shape of electrical motors and AI brings new challenges, but you expect that core principle of form following function will always provide a solution that connects with its audience. The Audi Q4 e-tron concept features recycled plastic fabric and sustainable paint developed to reflect sunlight so the car requires less air-conditioning.Being ahead of the curve while remaining faithful to its ideals is how Audi has managed to match its engineering prowess with an equally impressive design aesthetic. In short, it’s the Audi way of doing business – and it’s also why the phrase vorsprung durch technik has become synonymous with the brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e62eafc75ec9356a2c7fe22172d76b1cb7679589/0_583_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96aab499cdbca662dbed299c70e8dfe1","title":"organ donation new technique can preserve human livers for a week","story":"Week-long storage boosts time organs are usable and distances over which they can be movedHuman livers from organ donors can now be preserved for a week, researchers have revealed, a dramatic improvement on previous techniques, which could only keep the organs usable for a matter of hours.The technology could boost the number of livers available for transplantation and offer new approaches to treating diseases such as liver cancer.Livers are typically only stored for about nine to 12 hours on ice before transplant.In 2018 researchers in the UK published a report on system that allows livers to be kept at body temperature for 24 hours, a move that the lead author said at the time “improved both the transplant success rate as well as the number of livers available for transplant”.The week-long storage, the researchers say, would not only increase the distance over which organs can be transported, but offers another crucial advantage: it gives damaged livers more time to repair themselves, boosting the number of livers that could be used for transplant, while allowing doctors to reject those that are unsuitable.“We know from operations on patients and others that the liver needs a week to fully regenerate,” said Clavien.Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology, Clavien and colleagues report how they engineered a machine that keeps the liver alive and well by performing similar roles as the human body, including pumping blood through the organ and introducing nutrients and hormones such as insulin.Clavien said the system also removed waste products from the blood, allowing it to be cycled through the organ, and regulated levels of oxygen and blood pressure while the organ itself was moved rhythmically to mimic breathing.The team initially developed the system using pig livers and carried out three liver transplants on the animals using livers that had been stored for a week. A few hours after transplantation, the team found no difference in the function or tissues of the livers compared with livers stored for just a few hours.The approach was then tweaked and tested on 10 human livers that had been stored traditionally but turned down for transplantation due to their poor quality.The team found that all 10 livers lost weight during the course of the week and four deteriorated. However, six livers showed improvements and at the end of seven days were deemed suitable for transplantation. The study has limitations, including that some aspects of liver function can only be assessed many months after transplantation.However, Clavien said the system would be used for livers initially stored on ice but deemed too poor quality for immediate transplantation, and that in future it may also be used to boost the quality of marginal livers. Transplants in humans using the approach were in the offing, he said. The system could also offer new approaches to tackling a range of diseases, the researchers say. For example, a patient with liver cancer could have a healthy section of their liver removed, have it grown using the machine, and then reimplanted with the remaining cancerous liver removed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ba502009e4d3c98b88d07630e5aa0b03b00a9d/0_32_3338_2003/master/3338.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d98ab1b321007e74d3368fb8e3dda49","title":"louis rees zammit contract gloucester","story":"Gloucester have moved to secure the future of their 18-year-old wing Louis Rees-Zammit, who is expected to be named in Wales’s squad for the Six Nations on Wednesday.A product of the club’s academy system after he started studying at Hartpury College as a 16-year-old, Rees-Zammit has signed a long-term contract with Gloucester.

Holding up three thick folders of notes, they asked for, and received, a delay in the trial. They said the evidence included statements that Massata Diack made to investigators in Senegal and banking details from three of his consultancy firms.From Senegal Massata Diack told the  that he and his father’s legal team questioned the right of the French prosecutors to put them on trial. “The IAAF is a private law association of Monaco and its head office is in the principality of Monaco,” he wrote. “The charges did not occur in France and no French legal person or inidual was damaged by President Lamine Diack and his son.”Among 16 criticisms of the French investigation the statement claims that Lamine Diack was “arrested on Sunday morning while holding a Senegalese diplomatic passport – and his investigator did not even wait to consult the Embassy of Senegal in Paris and the ministry of business French foreigners before triggering the preliminary police investigation”.This, the document states, is “in violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention concerning the holders of a diplomatic passport”.Diack is charged with corruption, money laundering and breach of trust. Prosecutors say he directly or indirectly solicited €3.45m from athletes suspected by the IAAF of doping who paid to have their names cleared so they could continue competing.Prosecutors also charged Diack for involvement in a $1.5m payment from Russia to finance presidential and legislative election campaigns in Senegal in 2012, in exchange for slowing down doping cases targeting Russian athletes.Diack is also accused of having enabled his son to embezzle IAAF sponsorship revenue from Russia’s VTB Bank, Chinese oil firm Sinopec and broadcaster CCTV, South Korean tech giant Samsung and others.At one point the 86-year-old staggered to his feet and approached the three judges to beg to be allowed to return to Senegal to see his elderly brother. His request was denied.Massata Diack, a former IAAF marketing executive, also faces corruption, money laundering and breach of trust charges. He remains in exile in Senegal, with the country defying France’s attempts to extradite him.Massata Diack also denied any wrongdoing and said he doubted the Senegalese government would make him go. “Britain and France never extradite their citizens. Why would Senegal do it to a country that does not have legal competence to investigate a federation based on Monaco?” he wrote. “I am not going to waste my time in France!!”He denied a deal had been done with the Russians to help with elections in Senegal. “There is no proof that Lamine Diack has received 1,500,000 Euros for the 2012 Senegalese electoral campaign,” he wrote.“They have traced all our Bank account transfers using TRACFIN,” he added. “Where is the money? After four years of investigation. The French judges after this lengthy investigation should have more concrete evidence.”Four other men are also due to stand trial in Paris. They include the Russian coach Alexei Melnikov and Valentin Balakhnichev, a former IAAF treasurer, who were banned from athletics for life for causing “unprecedented damage” to the sport along with Massata Diack after being found guilty of corruption, blackmail and extortion charges in 2016.Habib Cissé – Lamine Diack’s legal counsel – who was banned from athletics for life last September, is also accused, as is the former IAAF anti-doping chief Gabriel Dollé, who was banned from athletics for five years for his part in the scheme to extort money from athletes. All deny the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ceb9ae05eb646d00a053623f0542e4724f58748/71_0_5218_3131/master/5218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b7cb27ec92ce2db4a4c6ac1b04ade56","title":"woakes archer wood collingwood england second test team cricket","story":"Three pacemen and one place: that is England’s dilemma in Port Elizabeth. Someone has to replace Jimmy Anderson in the team and the only way in which the three candidates – Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes – can impress is in the nets. On Monday they all steamed in they will do the same on Wednesday in a shorter session and then Joe Root, now fit enough to train after a stomach bug, must decide which one to play in the Test starting here on Thursday.Collingwood explained how the challenge is slightly different at South Africa’s oldest Test venue from that in the first two Tests. “Here at PE it’s generally a slower pitch, so sometimes having that kind of X-factor can be great.” To translate, the X factor refers to the extra pace that both Archer and Wood can generate when everything is in alignment.“Sunday’s training session was one of the best we’ve had for a long time,” said Collingwood. “We saw bowlers really running in against the batters. They were really making it difficult for them. If we can do that more often, then our education as a team will grow very strongly and very quickly.”Then Collingwood countered the suggestion that Archer, who actually ended up with six wickets in the first Test, has been a little disappointing on this tour as well as expanding on the X-factor. “He’s very early on in his international career. He hasn’t bowled a lot with the Kookaburra ball, which requires a completely different skillset from the Duke’s. His main skill is bowling 90mph plus. We have enough bowlers in and around the county circuit who can bowl at 82 to 85mph and try to nip it around. You want the likes of Wood and Archer to give you that X-factor.”The caveats abound: Archer has had a slight problem with his elbow Wood has not played any cricket since the World Cup: Woakes is now fit but what about the X-factor? Much may depend on the evaluation of the pitch but only a fool draws any conclusions three days before the start of the game. On Monday the strip, which is darker than the rest of the square, was well-grassed with the odd bare patch. It did not look a thing of beauty and the data tells us that draws have become a rare event at this ground. Root stared at the surface intently while in conversation with Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe.Meanwhile the rest of the squad was on the outfield playing with a football. But panic not. They were not actually playing football. They were attempting some hybrid game that is volleyball played with a football, minus a net. There was a lot of noise and plenty of argument as the senior citizens, many of whom are not especially old, took on the nippers, many of whom are really quite young. Your correspondent naturally monitored proceedings but at the end of it all had no idea who had won. Nor, one suspects, did the spin-bowling coach, Jeetan Patel, who was umpiring the contest.Patel has more important work to do this week. Not only is there debate about which paceman should play on Thursday England must also consider the spinner’s berth, and here Patel’s input will surely be important so too will that of the medics. Jack Leach would have a strong case to be restored to the XI if – and it’s quite a big if – he can convince everyone he is fully fit after being laid low by illness not only before the first Test but at the end of the last one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a89f13ccbbedecc1d61f2aabcfa9174594e8165/0_65_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9739518f5f097f29cda847be2e08a237","title":"brian blessed rosalind blessed interview cats astronaut","story":"Dressed in pyjamas and wellies, the great actor talks about his astronaut training in Russia, the original Cats – and putting his might behind his daughter Rosalind’s very personal playsOn a shelf in Brian Blessed’s study is a plastic toy, a replica of himself as Prince Vultan in the film Flash Gordon. There is a resemblance but, with this actor, the very idea of a miniature seems wrong.The mountainous original is sitting at his desk, wearing a striking winter morning costume of red fleece, pyjama bottoms and wellington boots. He must be the hairiest 83-year-old man in existence, his huge head crowned by a thick grey thatch, his neck Tudor-ruffed by what seem metres of white beard.“Kenneth Branagh sits every week where you’re sitting!” he booms.The actors met 30 years ago when Blessed was cast in Branagh’s film of Henry V. Both now live on the Surrey-Berkshire borders, which allows for regular catch-ups. “It’s a father-son relationship. He’s the father and I’m the son!” declares Blessed, a gag he has used on the TV chat-show circuit and in the autobiographical one-man show he tours around the UK.The agenda in the Blessed-Branagh gatherings apparently has the older actor discussing his plans for terrestrial and extraterrestrial expeditions – Blessed is an Everest-level mountaineer and has undertaken astronaut training in Russia – while the younger man seeks advice on showbiz projects, such as the movie of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile that he is currently shooting at nearby Longcross Studios.“You’ll see it from the motorway down there!” An extravagantly pointed finger threatens to remove the eye of a nodding plastic doll of the 14th Dalai Lama, whom Blessed counts as a friend. “Branagh’s rebuilt fucking Egypt!”“Will you work with Branagh again?” I ask. “I hope not!” roars Blessed. “Why hope not?” “Because we’ve done five films over the years and my friendship with him is much more important than being in films. So we have an agreement that he never directs me again.”Blessed lives in a secluded long, low house filled with trinkets and memorabilia relating either to dogs (there are now “only” three, down from a family maximum of seven) and Liverpool FC, which his wife, the actor Hildegard Neil, supports. My visit is to talk to Blessed and his daughter Rosalind, also an actor, about two stage plays she has written, on which he is credited as “executive producer”.“Ask me anything you want!” Blessed thunders, as we sit alone in his den, waiting, I have assumed, for the author. “Isn’t Rosalind going to be here?” I ask. “Oh, no no. No!” “I thought I was talking to both of you?” “Ah-ha. OK, I’ll go and find her.”Luckily, she turns out to be in the garden, rather than her house seven miles away. The three of us are about to start speaking when Blessed announces that he must ask Hildegard to walk the dogs. He is absent for some time, Ros’s initial optimism about his early return giving way to visible doubts. She goes on a search mission, rounding up a contrite Blessed, who has been distracted by discussions with a gardener.Ros’s plays, premiered at the Old Red Lion Theatre in London, cover such subjects as orce, stalking, abusive relationships, eating disorders and self-harm. Not least because there is a character called Ros, audiences will inevitably wonder how much she made up. “I am orced,” she says, “although the play isn’t the story of my marriage. However, I have experienced, in other relationships, mental and physical abuse. There was a guy a few years ago who had me up by my throat against a wall, smashed a mirror over my dog. I had to rush into the street, like in a horror movie.”Survivors of domestic violence are increasingly encouraged to seek redress, however long after the events, by contacting the police or confronting the perpetrator. Has she thought of doing that? “No. No, I haven’t. All I can say is that I think I’ve spent so much of my life stuck in the past that I just don’t want to revisit those things any more. I found it hard to forgive myself for letting it happen over and over again.”She found that writing The Delights of Dogs and the Problems of People, which features a dangerous relationship, “released a lot of that shame”. Thanks to a therapist and (after five years single) a fiance, she feels that “the cycle, I hope, is over”. Lullabies for the Lost, about a mental health therapy group, also reflects her experience: “Yeah. I’ve had mental health problems, I’ve had eating disorders, body dysmorphia, self-harm. I’ve fragmented myself into various characters.”It strikes me that, for Blessed, the plays must have been like reading his daughter’s secret diaries. How much had he known? “Only a little because people lead their own lives. So it was deeply upsetting to read because you’re very protective of your children.”His support for the subject matter of his daughter’s plays also reflects a longer family history. His father, a coal-hewer in South Yorkshire, was crushed and gassed in an accident, leaving the family reliant on minimal sick pay. “My mother had a complete nervous breakdown,” he recalls. “I was 12. My dad was in hospital so I had to go along with my mother and sign forms for her to have electro-convulsive therapy.”At the age of 18, while working on a building site before going to drama school, he had a breakdown of his own. His parents found their usually extrovert son staring silently at the fire, thrown by a local newspaper review that accused him of “overacting”. It’s a judgment that now seems funny given the scale of the performances that made him famous, but it devastated the young man. At a speech lesson in Rotherham, he collapsed into uncontrollable tears, then passed out. His teacher revived him by singing songs from Shakespeare, while stroking his head with a sponge.“It was the only time in my life I’ve experienced a miracle,” Blessed says. “They stopped the storm in my head and cured me. But, in Yorkshire, they used to say of people, ‘That one’s got a tile missing.’ And all I can say is that, on that day, my tile was put back in place. But I feel I always have to make sure that the tile can’t come loose again.”How much did Ros know about her dad’s history? “I’ve always known about my grandmother’s breakdown. I didn’t know about Dad’s collapse until he wrote a book about his childhood called The Dynamite Kid. And it’s a strange thing, I now realise. Even though I knew that was in our family, it never occurred to me when I was going through the wringer that I had a perfect ally in my dad, who would have listened non-judgmentally. And I just didn’t do it. I suppose it’s a combination of shame and embarrassment and not wanting to upset people.”A striking aspect of Ros’s writing is how freely her characters, male and female, use the C-word. As the obscenity often features in anecdotes from and about her father, is this a family trait? She laughs. “Yes, indeed. Growing up in our house, I didn’t even know the C-word was a bad word. In retrospect, it’s quite lucky that I wasn’t bandying it about at school. But I love swearing. I don’t see it as offensive. It’s like poetic seasoning in speech.”In showbiz, the credit “executive producer” can signify significant creative input or a vanity courtesy. So in what way is Blessed executively producing Ros? “He’s doing it right now, frankly – publicising the shows. Dad came to an early reading of the plays and – because of everything we’ve discussed, the family history of mental illness – was very receptive to it. When I was younger, I distanced myself professionally from Dad because of accusations of nepotism. But I’m 44 now and I just wanted to get the plays out to anyone who might be suffering or struggling. I brought Dad on board so, quite frankly, we can afford to put it on, along with other financial backers. Also, if you want something to reach people’s ears, who better to shout than Brian Blessed?”Ros writes in the plays about body dysmorphia. But, for Blessed, his size has been his fortune. Has he ever been uncomfortable about his body? “No, no. I love myself,” he bellows. “I do envy that,” his daughter responds.“I love myself more than I love Rosalind – or my wife! I can’t wait to wake up in the morning and be me. I look in the bathroom mirror and I’m a cross between a yeti and a gorilla. But I love it. On mountains in the Himalayas, the sherpas call me Big Yeti. I love it that I’ve got a 55-inch chest.”Ros looks thoughtful. “What’s interesting is that, despite having written the plays and been through therapy, I put on some weight last year because someone close to me was very ill, and I haven’t got rid of it yet. And so I start to think, as a size 16, maybe I shouldn’t be on stage, people probably shouldn’t have to look at me. And that’s ridiculous.”Women in showbiz are notoriously pressured to lose weight, so has a producer or director ever waved a diet sheet or personal trainer at Blessed? “No! No never!” he says. Ros adds: “Isn’t that interesting?”She has to leave for a dress rehearsal. I stay to ask him about Cats. In the 1981 stage premiere of the musical, Blessed played Bustopher Jones and Old Deuteronomy, roles taken by James Corden and Judi Dench in the new film version that has been critically clawed to box-office death. “I’ve not seen it yet,” he says. “I remember when my agent rang up and said, ‘They want to see you for a stage show called Cats.’ And I said, ‘Cats? Fucking gorillas maybe! Bears!’”Whereas the movie was an expected success that became a disaster, the theatre version had the opposite journey. Blessed remembers the production team in tears of despair over funding, going with the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber to beg money from banks – who refused because the idea seemed so absurd. “But, when I went to the North Pole, I came across an igloo and there was an Inuit inside, playing Memory from Cats on a banjo. Now that is success!”He insists that he feels “no jealousy or resentment about not being in the film. I will see it, but I worry. In the theatre, you can do anything – human beings as cats. But it’s harder on film. But I wish them well with it. I envy no other bugger. I celebrate talent.”He is writing a travel book at the moment and hopes to play Prospero on stage, the insertion of a “very advanced pacemaker” having solved a cardiac arrhythmia problem that forced him to abandon his production of King Lear five years ago. He has always said his biggest ambition is to go into space, but surely he won’t now ever do it? “Of course I will! But it’s hush hush.”The last two words are whispered – or at least reduce-boomed.• Lullabies for the Lost and The Delights of Dogs and the Problems of People are at the Old Red Lion theatre, London, until 1 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0147f16fe9feef1ae36b879b66796de0c28d13a7/239_0_3532_2121/master/3532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6249c3376de9b3726943eae4fa5701a2","title":"a bullet dodged can winter love island survive its controversies","story":"The reality show is riddled with issues – and adding a new series reeks of desperation. Is this the beginning of the end for the ITV2 behemoth? Love Island has occupied a weird spot in the heart of British culture for a few years now, at once able to be adored by the public at large and intellectualised to death by broadsheet newspapers. But you have to admit that, if the wheels were ever going to come off, they’ll come off now.The controversy regarding the suicides of two former contestants, and the questions asked of ITV about the level of aftercare afforded to them, did Love Island no favours. And the sudden change in personnel, with Laura Whitmore being drafted in at the last minute after previous host Caroline Flack (who denies all claims) was accused of bludgeoning her boyfriend’s head with a table lamp in his sleep, couldn’t have come at a worse time. And now there is a winter Love Island series, the first episode of which debuted last night.This might be the biggest danger of all. The show has moved past the other issues especially Flack, who in reality didn’t actually contribute very much. But adding a second annual series reeks of desperation. Oversaturation has already killed everything from Big Brother to X Factor, and at this rate Love Island might be next. It now needs to source twice as many contestants a year without demonstrating a drop in quality. Surely there aren’t enough identical preening berks in the UK to sustain that sort of output.But good news! Apparently there are! The opening episode was textbook Love Island. The boys were all woy-oy sixpacks and cartoon teeth. The girls all uniformly looked as if they required the services of an osteopath from struggling under the weight of their own eyebrows. One contestant claims she was the inspiration for that song Lewis Capaldi wrote about his horrible girlfriend. Another’s chat-up line was “If my dad dies, I become a lord.” One boy observed the full, beautiful, dramatic sweep of humanity with all its gorgeous and heartbreaking nuances before declaring that his greatest wish in life was to have a girlfriend with nice eyebrows. Meanwhile, the girls quickly agreed that they really wanted to find a boy with a personality. That’s it. That’s as detailed as the discussion got.Nor has the new winter setting altered the format. Part of me was hoping that a show called Winter Love Island would really lean into the title, and consist of nothing but introverts in big coats avoiding eye contact over cups of tea during a slating blizzard in Bognor. But no. Like always, it was just loads of slow motion footage of women in bikinis Here Come The Girlsing their way across some decking for what felt like hours at a time. God, there is so much slow motion on Love Island. If ITV would play the whole thing at normal speed, the entire series would be over by Wednesday.Obviously it’s pointless to truly judge a reality show by its first episode, because all the really entertaining fights and handjobs and ugly personality schisms won’t occur for another week or so. But already the show is doing a good job at pointing us towards potential baddies. Key among them are Connor – a man who genuinely bought his teeth on Google – who has already shown himself to be needy and vindictive in equal measure and Ollie, who is posh.And then there are The Twins, Eve and Jessica, who sent the status quo haywire in the dying moments of last night’s episode by tottering in like a pair of Paris Hilton androids sent loopy by a rogue Lambrini spill. By being twins with boobs, they currently represent the biggest threat to every single rock solid 45-minute-old relationship inside the villa.So far, we can rack up this series as a bullet dodged. For better or worse, Winter Love Island is exactly the same as Summer Love Island. If you didn’t like the original, there is nothing to suggest that you’ll suddenly come around to it now. But if you’re a fan, knock yourselves out. Now you get to spend two seasons a year feeling bad about your physical appearance instead of just one. Saints be praised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a286574989c947eb581d5542ecbcfa805913b5a/0_0_2976_1786/master/2976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12373b0cee17f2e9951fb1d633515512","title":"a new dimension of humanity auschwitz comes to tv in colour","story":"A two-part documentary, featuring images colourised for the first time, aims to bring new relevance to the events of the HolocaustBlack and white footage and photographs from inside the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz will be shown in colour on television for the first time, in a two-part documentary to be broadcast in the UK later this month. Auschwitz Untold in Colour will also feature testimonials from those who escaped the mass execution camps – including a rare testimonial from a French Romany survivor.As well as footage, the programme features pictures from the Auschwitz Album, the only known photos to have been taken inside the camp and thought to originate from SS guards. In an incredible coincidence, one participant was able to identify people in the photos whom they personally recognised.Colourisation has previously been used in projects including Peter Jackson’s 2018 documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, which explored the experiences of soldiers in the first world war. It is hoped that it will make the Holocaust more relevant to viewers. In a statement from Fulwell73, the production company behind sports documentaries Sunderland ’Til I Die and The Class of ’92, development producer Sheldon Lazarus said the documentary aimed to “remove a barrier that separates contemporary audiences … so that we never ever forget the atrocities of the past”. Similarly, Shulman commented that it was “extremely surprising to see the dimension of humanity that was added”, from the “grisly, horrible” scenes within the camps to images of liberation. “It all gives the film more contemporary resonance. It is not just about history but about today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd08481f4520f443605929f7a1d5016a730faad0/0_177_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce98556cf18ed7348f5888e7edfa9061","title":"successions brian cox i was touched up by princess margaret","story":"Fresh from winning a Golden Globe for his portrayal of media tycoon Logan Roy, the actor talks about class, cannabis and an odd royal encounterDoing an interview over the phone can be a thankless job: lines get crossed, you awkwardly interrupt one another and, without the intimacy of a face to face encounter, it’s hard to get a sense of the other person. But doing a phone interview with Brian Cox – the acclaimed actor, that is, not the pop-star-turned-particle-physicist with the same name – is such a hoot that if we met in person I would have probably dissolved into a puddle of hysteria.“No, no, not now, I’m having an important conversation!” he barks when someone has the temerity to try to enter his hotel room 45 minutes into our chat. “So where was I? Ah yes …” And he launches back into the anecdote about the time Princess Margaret felt him up. The man has so much charisma – and so many anecdotes – to burn, I can practically feel my phone melting against my face.Cox has a place in north London, as well as a family home in New York, where he lives with his wife, Nicole Ansari, and their two sons. But we are talking by phone because he is still in Los Angeles, celebrating his triumph at the Golden Globes last weekend. He was named best actor in a TV series for his role on HBO’s Succession as Logan Roy, the oligarch who occasionally encourages but largely torments his four grasping, feuding children. The show (which was created by Peep Show’s Jesse Armstrong and will shoot its third season this year) is brilliant on wealth, media tycoons and corrupt dynastic families and feels breathtakingly of the moment. But the smart writing and acting make it timeless. Cox’s performance as the inscrutable then suddenly, terrifyingly, raging centre of the family already feels definitive.Yet when his name was announced last Sunday, he was shocked. “Well, you never know with these things, do you? I thought I was maybe in with a chance, if only from a longevity point of view,” he says with a low rumble of a laugh. At 73, he will celebrate 60 years in the business next year. “I’m just surprised I’m still standing, I really am,” he says.Afterwards, he celebrated his win – and Succession’s win, which was named best TV drama – by “taking lots of selfies”. Elton John paid his respects: “He was very praising of my Churchill, which was kind,” says Cox, who played the PM in the eponymous 2017 film. Leonardo DiCaprio also stopped by to tell him: “I’ve always wanted to work with you.” “Well, you’ve taken long enough about it,” Cox growled back. Has Cox always wanted to work with DiCaprio? “Mmmm, I don’t think in those terms,” he says affably.Mainly he celebrated with the cast, even giving Kieran Culkin, who plays Cox’s onscreen son, a big kiss on the mouth as he went up to get his award. “I’m close to all my boys. We’re very family-like, which is ironic as we play such a dysfunctional family,” he says.I ask if that closeness makes it harder for him to torture them on the show, such as in the infamous “boar on the floor” segment, when Logan makes family members scrabble for sausages.“No, I love being nasty to my children!” he cackles.Given that Cox is one of Britain’s most prolific actors, celebrated as much for his theatre work (he won an Olivier in 1988 for Titus Andronicus) as he is for his TV roles (Nuremberg, Deadwood, Bob Servant Independent) and film successes (Manhunter, Braveheart, Super Troopers, The Bourne Identity), it would be ludicrous to describe this as his moment. Even in his relatively small roles – as the disapproving headmaster in Rushmore, say, or the terrifying writing guru in Adaptation – Cox has always dominated the screen. But Logan Roy has caught the public’s imagination in a way that feels new to him.Cox is a Labour supporter who has campaigned for Scottish independence. So he wasn’t wildly impressed with the results of last month’s election. “Ach! The Brits are so feudal. They don’t listen to a civil servant like Jeremy Corbyn, but they will listen to a windbag Tory like Johnson. And my country has suffered for it,” he says.I have heard that Cox is a fan of cannabis so I ask if that helps him cope with the political situation in the US and UK. There is a long pause and I worry I’ve overstepped a line.“It’s absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone – get stoned!” he says with deep feeling. “It does make the politics easier to bear. It’s a way of dealing with idiocy.”Has he always been a stoner? “I didn’t start until I was 50,” he says. “I was very against it, actually. You know, I got married at 21 to an upper-middle-class English girl – well, with Scots parentage, but you know English Scots are the most English! Hahaha! We had two children, one went to St Paul’s, one went to Cheltenham Ladies College. It was all done proper. It wasn’t who I was, but happy wife, happy life. Then when I was 50, I realised I missed out on what was going on with young people because I was so square, and I was working so hard, I needed something to relax. So I discovered the wonderful world of cannabis.”There have been inevitable comparisons between Logan Roy and Rupert Murdoch, despite Cox’s denials (“Rupert Murdoch has fuck all to do with it, and you can quote me on that,” he barked at the Golden Globes). But it must be strange for him, having played a media tycoon now for two seasons, to see the ongoing dominance of Fox News in the US, or to watch Michael Bloomberg’s bid for the presidency.“Yeah, it’s interesting. All these guys, whether they’re liberal or the opposite, they see themselves as leaders. And they all have their own problems – clearly, because we’re suffering because of their problems! We’ve suffered under the hands of the Murdoch press and Conrad Black and now Donald Trump.”And yet despite the show depicting how extreme wealth corrupts extremely, it has accrued fans among that demographic. Cox was recently in a cafe in Primrose Hill, north London, when he was approached by a man who told him that he and his wife liked Succession, “but she found it a little hard to watch sometimes”.“Who’s your wife?” asked Cox. “Elisabeth Murdoch,” he replied. “Can you go a bit easier on her next season?”So I’m guessing he’s not a fan of The Crown, I say. There’s another pause. “I love it!” he says, and makes a loud guilty laugh. “I resisted it for ever and a day and then I started to watch it and it was like heroin. I was completely hooked – and that’s how they get you.”Jesse Armstrong wove some of Cox’s biography into Logan’s, making the character a native of Dundee and even shooting some scenes in Cox’s hometown. Like Logan, Cox has a daughter and three sons from two marriages and, also like his alter ego, his childhood was unimaginably different from the one he was able to give his kids.Cox was born and raised in Dundee, the youngest of five children of a butcher and a spinner. The family was always poor but when Cox was eight their situation worsened immeasurably after his father died from cancer. Soon after, his mother had a severe nervous breakdown and was given electric shock treatment. From the age of 10, Cox was largely raised by his sisters and on some nights, there was so little food in the house he would go to the local chippie and beg for battered scraps.“People who don’t know poverty haven’t lived, quite frankly. You know everything is conditional,” he says. To this day, he has a bigger wardrobe than his wife because he is a terrible hoarder – after growing up with nothing, he can’t bear to give anything away.Cox stumbled through school, leaving at 15 with no qualifications. He worked as a stage manager (“Worst stage manager ever – I always left the iron on”) before going to Lamda to study acting.I ask what he thinks about the arguments over whether British acting is too dominated by posh people and he jumps in before I finish.“You can’t blame Damian Lewis or Eddie Redmayne or whatsisname, er, Benedict Cumberpast, er, Cumberpat, no, Cumberbatch – that’s it,” he says. “You know, talent is talent and one has to be careful about not being mean. But it says something about our creative work that we haven’t got an even playing field. Egalitarian thinking is completely lacking in the UK,” he says.This lack of egalitarianism sparks another thought. There is a brief cheeky “Shall I tell this or not? Yes, I shall” hesitation.“You know, when I was a young actor I was touched up by Princess Margaret,” he says.Brian, I am going to need more details on this.“I was at the Royal Court. I was doing a play with Alan Bates and it was my 23rd birthday and I’d been given a red shirt from Lindsay Anderson. I’d just washed my hair so I was sort of glistening, heh heh heh, and I walked in and was introduced to her. She put her fingers on my shirt, and said: ‘This is a lovely shirt.’ And she started to run her fingers down the inside of my shirt. And I went: Uh oh! What do you do when you’re being touched up by a royal?”What do you do?“It was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going ‘Ooooh’ out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn’t take in at all. She just kept saying: ‘You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you …’ She was an extraordinay creature. I excused myself and said: ‘Thank you, ma’am,’ and it came to a natural end.”What an amazing man Cox is, working his way up from begging for scraps in Dundee to the absolute top of the Hollywood tree ( “I know, I must write my memoir”). Even his Brooklyn apartment is so smart that the New York Times once did a whole article about it. This included the memorable detail that he and his wife have separate bedrooms and a studio that they “tryst in”. Is this true? He has a shag room?“Yeah! We do. The problem is in New York City it’s bloody hard to find the space.

And it probably isn’t going to get much better either, since the year will also mark the end of a number of your favourite television shows. Here’s a roundup of the key series preparing to come to an end.True, The Good Place isn’t the show that it once was. What began as a truly delightful, optimistic exploration of ethics has gown saggy and directionless, in part thanks to that unnecessarily long stretch where we were subjected to The Worst Australian Accents Ever Heard By Human Ears. Nevertheless, with just four episodes left, it’s still sad to say goodbye to Team Cockroach. If we get to the end of the year without anyone greenlighting a Joey-style spin-off for Janet, I will personally be very upset indeed.I’ll be honest here. I, like you, didn’t realise that Homeland was still on. Once the Brody storyline came to its own absurdly silly conclusion, Homeland devolved into something much more flat and uninteresting. Did you know that this will be the eighth season of Homeland? Can you remember a single thing about the seventh, sixth or fifth seasons? Me neither. But hopefully it can rally this year and end big. Carrie Mathison has been though a comically huge amount this last decade. If this last run can tie up her story with enough grace, this could be worth watching.Now this one is sad. The first episode of Schitt’s Creek only appeared in 2015, but in that time it has shaken off its rusty sitcom premise to become something truly special. It’s a warm, wonderful, inclusive show that has a tendency to make every viewer feel like the first person to ever discover it. There will be so much to miss when Schitt’s Creek leaves us – not least Catherine O’Hara’s breathtakingly weird performance as Moira – and there are sure to be tears along the way.Like Schitt’s Creek, BoJack is another series that managed to slip its potentially horrible premise – a horse is a Hollywood has-been – and become something nuanced and beautiful. BoJack has been sad as much as it has been funny, with every repercussion to every horrible decision tending to play out in full before us. This final season has been split in two. The first half ended on an incredibly ominous note, as BoJack’s quest for redemption butted hard against the damage that his behaviour has caused. Honestly, these last episodes could go either way. We might see a happy Hollywood ending, or something unbelievably dark could be in store.It only seems like yesterday that we were being introduced to the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, and yet now it’s coming to an end. One of the best – if not the best – Netflix Original series, GLOW had so much going for it. It hit the peaks of 1980s nostalgia with more accuracy and panache than its stablemate Stranger Things. It was able to surf genres, skipping from comedy to drama to flat-out parody, with an ease that remains untouchable. In Betty Gilpin it uncovered one of the best actors of the modern age. There’s no word about how the show plans to wrap up, but nevertheless this will be a hard one to leave.Now that even the youngest cast members are well into their mid-40s, it is finally time to say goodbye to the Pritchetts and the Dunphys. Modern Family has become a bit of a dinosaur of late. The child actors are now adults. The adult actors are now sleepwalking. The product placement episodes are glaring enough to be nauseating. And yet on its way out, perhaps the show can recapture some of the frenetic warmth that made us love it all those years ago. Here’s hoping.Everyone knew this was coming. As soon as Constance Wu used her social media presence to complain about its recommission last year, Fresh Off the Boat’s days were numbered. The bad news is that it’s a real shame Fresh Off the Boat wasn’t just an important sitcom in terms of authentic ersity, but it was also capable of being very funny. The good news is that we still get a whole season of watching Wu do her best to hide the fact that she really doesn’t want to be there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc492d72f11567f25884d73fb255c8260dae334/0_149_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8784575efad8296080923474f262a99d","title":"bernie sanders polling lead democrats campaign","story":"The Vermont senator raised more than any Democrat in the last quarter capping a stunning bounceback from a heart attackShortly after Bernie Sanders announced early this month that his campaign raised a showstopping $34.5m – the highest sum of any 2020 Democrat during any single quarter so far in this primary – #PresidentSanders was trending on Twitter.It was an extraordinary reversal of fortunes for a presidential candidate who, three months earlier, was in a Las Vegas hospital recovering from a heart attack. At the time, Sanders was under immense political pressure, eclipsed by fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren and counted out by many in the party and by the president.The episode might have derailed Sanders’ second quest for the White House had it not been for his army of loyal supporters, whose abiding faith turned the Vermont senator into a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination.With less than four weeks until voting begins and the next debate looming on Tuesday, Sanders is surging in Iowa and New Hampshire as his campaign touts new signs of growth in his support, particularly among young people of color.Even Larry David, the comedian who impersonates Sanders with striking likeness on Saturday Night Live, has been surprised by his doppelganger’s resilience.“I thought when he had the heart attack that was going to be it – I wouldn’t have to fly in from Los Angeles,” David told late-night host Stephen Colbert. “But, you know, he’s indestructible. Nothing stops this man.”Perhaps, but Sanders would not be where he is in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses without the unwavering support of a devoted community that he has cultivated since running for president in 2016. “Not me. Us” – Sanders’ campaign slogan – perfectly captures how the 78-year-old senator came to sit atop the latest Des Moines Register and CNN poll of Iowa caucusgoers in a primary contest that has so far been shaped by candidates who are younger, more erse and newer to national politics.In the days and weeks after Sanders’ hospitalization, an outpouring of concern and well wishes turned into a record wave of campaign donations that culminated in a “Bernie is back” rally in Queens featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who traces her political rise to Sanders’ 2016 campaign. There, she formally endorsed him in front of more than 20,000 ardent supporters.“The heart attack was in some ways the best thing that happened to his campaign,” said Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, a coalition of progressive groups that endorsed Sanders in December.She said it turned out to be a clarifying moment for his supporters, with Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement serving as a literal rallying cry.“Bernie has built a movement that makes people believe a different kind of politics is possible,” she said. “So when he came back, everyone wanted him to feel the love.”In surveys, Sanders supporters are significantly more loyal to him than those backing any other 2020 Democrat. They are more likely to say they will definitely vote for him and that they are “enthusiastic” about his candidacy.Their unshakeable support means that unlike many of his rivals Sanders may have the resources to stay in the race for months after the early-voting contests. Many Democrats fear he won’t exit the race even if he doesn’t have the delegates to win the nomination, dragging out the primary contest, weakening the eventual nominee and possibly even setting up a dramatic showdown at the party’s convention in Milwaukee.Sanders has said he would support the nominee.Sanders’ movement – coupled with a massive fundraising operation – sustained him through a potentially debilitating period of his campaign and lifted him higher still. More than any other Democratic campaign, his supporters are highly organized online. They share stories, polling and memes across hundreds of pro-Sanders Facebook groups. And this cycle, his campaign launched its own mobile app, Bern, and its own email newsletter, Bern Notice, that keeps his supporters engaged and up to date with news from the trail.“These tools are not as effective for persuasion,” said Michael Slaby, the Obama campaign’s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012. “If you’re an undecided voter you’re probably not tuning in to watch Sanders’ Twitch channel. But in terms of his ability to withstand challenges, it is really valuable to have that durable hard support.”Now an emboldened Sanders is sharpening his case for the presidency, tapping his deep financial resources to launch a large-scale advertising campaign in Iowa. He’s also become increasingly critical of his closest rival, Joe Biden, the putative Democratic frontrunner who has proved resilient at the top of the splintered field despite sustained attacks and self-inflicted gaffes.In interviews and on the trail, Sanders has emphasized his longstanding aversion to war in response to the escalation of tensions with Iran. It’s part of a wider strategy to undermine the core rationale for Biden’s candidacy: that he’s the most electable. In particular, the senator has aggressively criticized Biden for his 2003 vote to authorize the invasion of Iraq and his past support for foreign trade deals.Biden has mostly brushed off Sanders’ broadsides, though that could change in the next debate on 14 January, the last before the caucuses.He has also quietly started to target Warren, a fellow liberal and a friend whom he had refused to engage publicly.A script obtained by Politico instructed Sanders’ volunteers to tell voters wavering between the two liberals that Warren’s popularity was limited to the affluent and highly educated and that she was “bringing no new bases into the Democratic party” – a criticism meant to raise doubts about her electability.Her campaign responded in a fundraising letter on Sunday: “This type of attack isn’t about disagreeing on issues – it’s about dismissing the potency of our grassroots movement.”Sanders’ potential for victory, meanwhile, has stirred panic among establishment-minded Democrats. They see a candidate who entered the race with all the advantages of a frontrunner – near-universal name recognition, a prodigious fundraising operation and a message that still draws large, enthusiastic crowds – and yet has faced little scrutiny and relatively few attacks from his rivals.In recent weeks, many moderate Democrats have urged Sanders’ rivals to challenge his case for electability.In 2018, progressive candidates largely failed to prove they could build winning coalitions in swing districts and states. Many of the moderate House candidates who swept the Democrats to power by winning in Republican-held districts face tough re-elections and believe a Sanders nomination could jeopardize their majority, including a group of influential freshmen who recently endorsed Biden.A memo circulated by the centrist Third Way warns that nominating Sanders would result in “electoral carnage” on a scale not seen since 1984, when Ronald Reagan beat Walter Mondale by the widest electoral college margin in presidential history. Mondale carried only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia.Sanders’ team balks at such analysis, which they believes ignores more recent history. Hillary Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016, they say, was the cost of playing it safe.A recent Fox News poll found Sanders defeating Trump by nearly the same margin as Biden in Wisconsin, perhaps the most critical 2020 battleground.To win, Sanders’ campaign says he must expand the electorate by turning out a coalition of people who vote infrequently or have never voted before, including young, working-class and minority voters. Sanders’ campaign knows it must do better, particularly among black voters, a critical Democratic constituency that prefers Biden by wide margins.But his team argues that they are making progress. New polling has him running close behind Biden in Nevada, the first state with a large Hiic electorate to vote in the primary. And he is leading the field in California, a state with a large Hiic electorate that is also the largest prize of the Democratic nominating contests.And last quarter his campaign said it added 300,000 new donors and marked another milestone: it received more than 5 million donations, setting a new record for presidential candidates at this stage in the cycle.In the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Biden has started to consolidate support from establishment Democrats while Warren has started pitching herself as the candidate best positioned to unite a ided party.Unlike his rivals, Sanders must overcome deep skepticism from Democrats who still harbor reservations about his commitment to the party after years of agitating for change from the outside. Many Democrats who supported Clinton in 2016 still resent Sanders for dragging out the primary race and, in their view, not doing enough to help unify the party when the bitter contest was over.“Sanders has shown that he can fire up his base,” said Sean McElwee, the executive director of the liberal polling firm Data For Progress. “What he needs to show now is that he can persuade people to vote for him who right now are supporting Warren or Biden. He still needs to prove to Democrats that he can represent them and the party in a general election. That’s the big turn that he needs to make.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f792b76454343c81291979ce31234ab8e30bffab/0_150_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=352fe08390070b87b8a630a118a379cc","title":"philippines lava gushes from taal volcano as alert level raised","story":"Scientists warn ‘hazardous eruption’ imminent as offices, schools and airports closedLava has gushed out of a volcano in the Philippines after a sudden eruption of ash and steam that forced villagers to flee and shut down the country’s main airport, offices and schools.Clouds of ash were blown more than 62 miles (100km) north of the Taal volcano, reaching the bustling capital, Manila, and forcing the the main international airport to close and cancel more than 500 flights.There have been no reports of casualties or major damage from the eruption that began on Sunday.Police said more than 13,000 villagers had been moved to evacuation centres in the hard-hit province of Batangas and nearby Cavite, but officials expect the number to swell with hundreds of thousands more being brought to safety.The evacuation numbers are likely to be higher as local authorities help displaced people before notifying the national agency that is collating the figures. Some residents could not move out of ash-blanketed villages because of a lack of transport and poor visibility, while others are refusing to leave their homes and farms.“We have a problem, our people are panicking due to the volcano because they want to save their livelihood, their pigs and herds of cows,” Wilson Maralit, the mayor of Balete town, told DZMM radio. “Were trying to stop them from returning and warning that the volcano can explode again any time and hit them.”Maralit, whose town lies along the shoreline of Taal Lake, which surrounds the erupting volcano, appealed for troops and additional police to be deployed to stop residents from sneaking back into high-risk areas.Several planes stranded at the Manila airport might be allowed to take off on Monday once they were cleaned of ash and authorities were sure an easterly shift in ash-laden wind away from the capital would not revert, the airport general manager, Ed Monreal, told a news conference. The airport could not accommodate incoming flights until stranded aircraft had flown out and freed up parking bays, he said.The aircraft of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, was able to land on Monday after his flight, from his southern Davao city hometown, was delayed on Sunday by the volcanic eruption, his spokesman said.Taal had been restive for months until it suddenly rumbled back to life on Sunday, blasting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the sky, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Lava spurting from the volcano’s vents on Monday was falling into the lake surrounding the crater.The government volcano-monitoring agency raised the danger level around Taal three notches to level 4, indicating an imminent hazardous eruption. Level 5, the highest, means a hazardous eruption is under way and could affect a larger area with high-risk zones that would need to be cleared of people, said Renato Solidum, who heads the institute. María Antonia Bornas, the agency’s chief volcanologist, said Taal spurted fountains of lava early on Monday while its ash and steam ejections slightly eased. “It’s hard to tell when the eruption would stop,” she said, citing the volcano’s similar restiveness in the 1970s that lasted for about four months.With the ashfall easing on Monday, some residents began to shovel away ash that covered everything from homes to cars and roads in Tagaytay, a popular upland resort city on a ridge that overlooks the small but picturesque volcano. Many of the city’s restaurants and coffee shops, however, were closed.The volcanology institute reminded the public that the small island where the volcano lay was a permanent danger zone, although fishing villages had existed there for years. Authorities continued to detect swarms of earthquakes and the slight inflation of portions of the volcano, officials said, advising residents to stay indoors and to wear masks and goggles if they had to go outside.Public institutions, including schools, in many towns and cities were suspended on Monday, including in Manila, to avoid health risks posed by the ashfall. At least four Batangas towns reported power outages.Taal, one of the world’s smallest volcanoes, is among two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines and lies along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137687.1578865715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all the focus in politics now on the first fortnight in february","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe 32nd Dáil will have lasted almost four years by the time of the general election, a much longer period than most believed when the last election threw up its inconclusive result on February 26th, 2016. After those years of uncertainty, they now know an election will be held within weeks.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made his call and, while not being definitive, clearly indicated on RTÉ’s This Week that he will dissolve the Dáil in the coming days for an early February general election. The signs that Varadkar was moving in this direction were evident since before Christmas, when he began to carve out the space to allow himself to go to the country earlier than his previous suggested date of May 2020. He slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country. He then asked the impossible of Micheál Martin, asking that the Fianna Fáil leader should get his TDs to actually vote with the Government rather than abstain, as outlined in the confidence and supply agreement. Knowing his Fine Gael-minority government was on its last legs due to dwindling Dáil numbers, he prepared the ground for the announcement he is expected to make this week. UncertaintyPerhaps the Taoiseach was content to allow events of recent days – with Independent TDs shying away from supporting him and general uncertainty building momentum towards an election – play out. The past week has brought Varadkar to the destination he had likely settled on weeks ago: a general election campaign he hopes will be bookended by Brexit, what he on Sunday called “the big job of this Government”.He will travel to Belfast on Monday to meet British prime minister Boris Johnson, and Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, is in Dublin on Wednesday. If Varadkar opts for a February 7th election date, the UK will leave the EU one week out from polling day, and the issue will feature heavily in the final week of the campaign, when many voters make up their minds. On the issue of hospital beds, he said Fine Gael had “reversed” the cuts in health implemented by Fianna Fáil between 2007 and 2011, and added that he had worked with Brendan Howlin in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of 2011-2016 to increase investment. His interview also prompted action across political parties and among Independent TDs and candidates. Many TDs had already begun a heavy canvass schedule, but others had held back. Considering their futureDecisions on whether to actually run at all will also be made by others in the coming days, with two members of the Independent Alliance considering their future.Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath is understood to be consulting his family and local organisation on whether he will stand again in Dublin Bay North, with sources close to the political veteran saying he is “50-50”. Minister of State for Skills John Halligan is also said to be considering whether to retire from political life and not seek to hold on to his Waterford seat.Fianna Fáil is expected to make a few further ticket changes this week, such as the addition of a candidate in Cork North Central, and the party announced that Dara Calleary, its deputy leader, will be director of elections. Fine Gael’s executive council will also add more candidates in some constituencies as all political focus now turns to the first fortnight in February."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137683.1578864431!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar and martin flex political muscle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar: ‘Over the next five years we can look forward to building a much better country.’ Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMr Varadkar is set to seek a dissolution of the 32nd Dáil this week.He indicated heavily on Sunday that he will call an election in the coming days because the tight Dáil arithmetic had meant “circumstances had changed” since he previously stated he wanted to go to the polls in May.“I’ll end any uncertainty as soon as I can,” Mr Varadkar told RTÉ’s This Week, before adding that, as it stands, the Cabinet will meet on Tuesday and the Dáil will reconvene on Wednesday after the Christmas recess. Internal Fine Gael speculation suggests an election date of Friday, February 7th, although the following Friday, February 14th, is also mentioned. Mr Varadkar, however, has not given indications on his exact plans. Political speculation also suggested he could seek a dissolution of the Dáil from President Michael D Higgins on Wednesday or Thursday.Mr Varadkar will meet British prime minister Boris Johnson in Belfast on Monday, where the pair are expected to discuss the restored Stormont institutions, British-Irish relations and the future trading relationship. He will also meet First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyenwill be in Dublin on Wednesday.The Taoiseach sought to portray Fine Gael as the party best placed to continue economic growth and handle the next phase of the Brexit negotiations.“Over the next five years we can look forward to building a much better country, one where we can invest more in infrastructure, housing, healthcare, one where we can invest in public services, one where we can reduce taxes and put more money back in people’s pockets,” said Mr Varadkar. “That is now all possible. But it is only possible if it is managed well and the public finances are managed well and we are the people who are best placed to do that, not the people who failed to do it in the past.” ‘Dream of home ownership’Mr Martin told The  there will be “an avalanche of Fine Gael spin” over the coming weeks.“But some core facts cannot be spun and will form the foundation of this election,” he said. “A whole generation of people have seen the dream of home ownership slip away. And all across the country families are simply terrified at the prospect of their loved ones having to be admitted to hospital because of the record numbers of people on trolleys and the lack of support for those working on the front line.”In a sign of sparring likely to feature in the campaign, a Government Minister described some members of the Green Party as “nutters”.Minister of State for Local Government John Paul Phelan made the comments in a speech at an IFA dinner in his native Kilkenny on Saturday night.According to one source present, Mr Phelan said: “There are lots of good people in the Green Party, but some are nutters.”In response, Green Party Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin said: “That is language unbecoming of a Minister. If that is the type of campaign that is going to be run by Fine Gael, then I don’t think the electorate will thank them for it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138086.1578931354!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kevin boxer moran to leave independent alliance","story":"Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW) has announced he is leaving the Independent Alliance. In an interview with Shannonside Radio on Monday the Longford-Westmeath TD said he will be standing in the next election as an outright Independent, rather than under the banner of the Independent Alliance.Mr Moran said if he is re-elected he may join a new political grouping in the new Dáil. The Independent Alliance was set up principally by Minister for Transport Shane Ross before the last election and was Fine Gael’s main coalition partner for the last four years. Mr Moran said he would run as an Independent, separate to the Independent Alliance. After this he may consider joining another grouping. “If it’s not the Alliance, and it’s another alliance, so be it.”The Independent Alliance currently has four Ministers: Mr Ross, Mr Moran, Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath and Minister of State for Skills John Halligan. Mr McGrath is considering whether to stand again in Dublin Bay North but is expected to do so, while Mr Halligan is expected to announce later this week that he will not seek re-election in his Waterford constituency. It effectively means the Independent Alliance has come to an end.Meanwhile Clare TD Dr Michael Harty has confirmed he will not seek re-election in the four seat constituency.In a statement, Dr Harty said: “I am announcing today, 13th January 2020, that I am not putting my name forward as a candidate in the upcoming general election for personal and professional reasons.“At the outset, as a leader of the No Doctor No Village campaign, I committed to maintain general practice services in Kilmihil by putting in place a locum GP, while taking my seat as an Independent TD to fulfil all the responsibilities and duties associated with that position both nationally and locally.“Finding a full-time locum GP has proved increasingly difficult over the years. It is now not possible to fulfil both commitments. I have had to make a choice between seeking re-election or keeping my promise to my local community. I have chosen the latter.“It has been an honour and privilege to represent the people of Clare in 32nd Dáil while proposing alternative ideas on how to deliver balanced regional development for Clare, support rural sustainability and reform the structure our health services especially within the Mid-West region.“I would like to thank all those who have supported me during the election campaign of 2016 and over the past 4 years in Dáil Éireann, especially my family, political support staff both in Clare and in Dublin as I advocated for my constituents to the best of my ability.“I hope the imminent election campaign will be fair and robust, allowing all candidates to put forwards their ideas and policies clearly so that the people can make an informed choice.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137418.1578841130!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"megxit markle should wield her wokeness where it matters buckingham palace","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex leave Westminster Abbey in London after attending a Commonwealth Day service last March. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPI never had much use for the queen. Maybe it’s the Irish in me. As Winston Churchill said: “We’ve always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.” Or maybe it’s the American in me. We did go to an awful lot of trouble to break away from that corgi-and-gin-loving racket 244 years ago. At some visceral level, though, America must regret being torn away from the royal family. How else to explain our enduring fascination with dynasties? Having spent my career covering four dysfunctional political dynasties, I rebel more than ever at the idea that biology entitles you to authority.The ghost of Diana gone rogue animates the fractured fairy tale of Meghan and Harry, and their intemperate attempt to upend centuries of starchy rules and break away from the Firm. Princess Di’s dangerous tango with the tabloids left Harry with no taste to play that game again, especially with streaks of racism against Markle added to the mix. He recently confessed that every click or flash of a camera brought memories of his mother’s death racing back into his mind.US visitI covered Diana’s first trip as the Princess of Wales to America in 1985. She seemed happy then, in that year before Charles resumed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. She and the prince shared amused eye contact, winks and teasing remarks.Nancy Reagan planned an evening of candlelit dancing at the White House worthy of a 24-year-old Cinderella in a midnight blue velvet gown. The first lady arranged for the Marine Band to play Night Fever as John Travolta spun a euphoric Diana around the floor. (“She’s a great little mover,” he said afterwards.)I wondered how Prince Charles would deal with a young wife with so much star power, absorbing so much attention. We were all mesmerised when she tucked her chin down in that shy pose and cast that modest yet saucy look up at us. The answer was: he did not deal with it well. Twelve years later, when the unimaginable tragedy hit, the royal ice cubes were furious at the expectation that they should emote for the woman who had publicly ripped the monarchy as a bloodless, soulless gang and christened herself the Prisoner of Wales.The Firm was out of its depth then, and it is again now. How can the queen and Prince Philip and Prince Charles possibly understand the desire of Meghan and Harry to rebrand as a Goopish lifestyle enterprise? The news that they have applied to trademark hundreds of items, from socks to hoodies, under the “Sussex Royal” logo makes Wallis Simpson’s exile in the Bahamas, spent matching the colour on the walls to her face powder, seem positively monastic.Can you really call yourself “financially independent” when all you’re doing is cashing in on the royal name? Given the state of the world and the implosion of the British empire – with Scots once more contemplating an off ramp, Irish unity in play, Australia on fire and Boris Johnson tricking the queen into suspending parliament in a Brexit ploy – it is hard to feel sorry for the Duchess of Sussex complaining that her diamonds are heavy. The pathos for Markle, trapped in a designer cage, goes only so far.It’s easy for royals to come to North America, where they are lavishly embraced as celebrities without all those pesky restrictions about class and role. (See The Crown episode about a wild, imbibing Princess Margaret charming LBJ.) Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed – in Buckingham Palace. She could have channelled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America.Markle had already successfully brought a refreshing dose of semi-radical chic to the royal family. Her visits to a mosque that housed Londoners displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire led to her putting out a 2018 cookbook, the proceeds of which went to the victims.Irish visitAt its best, the monarchy has been able to lift up people, as it did during the blitz in the second World War. I saw that ability to alchemise emotions and opinions when I covered the queen on her visit to Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. It was impossible not to be impressed watching her speak Irish and offering regret about how Britain had made Ireland suffer, bowing her head at the scene of Bloody Sunday and the Garden of Remembrance, the sacred ground for slain Irish patriots.The Irish started out sceptical, but by the end of her visit, many were calling her “Betty” on Twitter. The queen of England holds out the idea that she and her family should have some sort of vestigial moral authority. But with the Prince Andrew imbroglio in the seraglio of Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harry’s run for the Hollywood Hills, it is clear that many in her family are not interested in moral authority.The collapse of the authority of the British monarchy mirrors the collapse of authorities generally, scarred by years of scandals about clergymen abusing children, athletes beating up girlfriends and university officials accepting bribes. And yet, even if the royals’ role in the culture is now akin to the Kardashians, it wasn’t cool for Meghan and Harry to pants the 93-year-old queen, defy her instructions, dump their Megxit plan on Instagram and intensify the sad split between the brothers.

His home had been flattened in the massive earthquake which hit Haiti ten years ago on Sunday, killing over 300,000 people. He heard word that there was space to live up in the hills, in an area on the outskirts of Port au Prince known as Canaan.And so he collected the remnants of his life in the impoverished Delmas 4 district, and moved up into the hills with his family.“But there was nothing here,” he recalls. “We arrived, and there was no one from the government. So we just asked around to find a free spot, and called it our own. We just had to guess how big an area we could claim.”The 7.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked Haiti 10 years ago wiped out almost a fifth of government employees, and left 1.5 million homeless.Cholera broke out, introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers, which killed 10,000 people and infected 800,000 more.Aid money poured into the Caribbean nation, and Bill Clinton – who spent his 1975 honeymoon with Hillary in Haiti – was made co-chair of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). Sean Penn became the unofficial mayor of a homeless camp Oprah Winfrey and Kim Kardashian jetted in to see for themselves.The fallout from the 2010 earthquake continues todayTen years later, Haitians shake their heads sadly and wonder where it all went wrong.There was so much energy, attention, and money - $13 billion (£10bn) promised in the years 2010-20, of which half was actually distributed. An additional $3 billion was contributed to UN agencies and NGOs by private donors, meaning that the $9 billion in aid was three times the revenue of the government of Haiti between 2010 and 2012.Yet 35,000 people still live in temporary accommodation, according to the International Organisation of Migration. In reality the figure is likely to be significantly higher, as people are classed as being housed even when living in a shack  Canaan is still home to around 200,000 people, who still don’t have running water or electricity.“They wanted us to move here, but they didn’t help us,” said Mr Appolos, 52, with a shrug.He founded a school in the new community, built from plywood and corrugated iron, and funded entirely from donations made by Haitians living in the area. Now 300 students attend his tiny make-shift study centre.Half-built houses litter the hillsides many began building, but run out of money to complete it. A small one-room breezeblock building would cost around $1,000 to make, he estimated.Haiti was initially flooded with celebrities and goodwill, but much of the promised money has failed to materialise“It’s been very, very hard to find a way to build,” he said. “We had to do it all ourselves.”When the earthquake hit, Enancy Bienaime\u0027s house folded on top of her like it was made of playing cards. For three hours she was trapped in the rubble her desperate cries eventually led neighbours to dig her out. For two years she then lived in a tent – one of thousands pitched on the marshy wastelands on the outskirts of Haiti’s capital, Port au Prince.“Life has only got worse since then,” she said.She showed The  the corrugated iron shed where she now lives with her husband and two children, built on the site of their former home.That house, in Cite Soleil, the largest slum in the northern hemisphere, was built in the 1950s by Voodoo doctor Francois Papa Doc Duvalier, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 15 years. Now it is home to 265,000 people, crammed into an area only eight miles square and without sewers, running water or social services. A fetid, rubbish-filled canal provides the only drainage, and frequently floods into the slums. Pigs wallow in the mud, and squeal inside the ruins which still line the streets.“This house is terrible, even compared to my previous one,” said Mrs Bienaime, 35. “It’s so hot, with the corrugated iron roof. And I know it could topple at any time. I’m constantly frightened.”A man sells ice cream to children in the Carradeux communityThe earthquake and its immense challenges created huge political problems, which have fuelled the rise of gangs across the country. The gangs are paid by political and business interests, to corral votes or control a zone fights for territory are fierce.Cite Soleil is among the most hotly-contested territory for the gangs. “There are nine year olds around here with guns,” said Mrs Bienaime. “My one year old daughter has seen so many shootings she now makes a pistol sign with her fingers, and a ‘pow, pow’ noise. It breaks my heart. I’m desperate to move away from here.”Kwanli Kladstrup, country director for Irish NGO Concern, runs a programme to help reduce the risks of natural disasters, ensure the protection of children, and build sustainable livelihoods. Her team proudly tell how they educate their community about surviving earthquakes and hurricanes, demonstrating hiding under tables, and sheltering in doorways.A woman walks past the ruins of Notre Dame Cathedral during Haiti\u0026#39s 10th earthquake anniversary“There have been some improvements since the earthquake, but the endemic poverty continues to push people to the limit of their coping abilities, and hinder progress,” she said.She points out that hunger is a very real problem. OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency, estimates that four million people will need emergency food rations by March.“We have to focus on increasing investment in sustainable food systems and agriculture, and developing local markets to raise productivity,” she said.Janvier Junior, 33, agreed. Born in the slum, he has never seen things so bad. Rampant inflation coupled with rising unemployment have made an already tough life almost impossible.“We really thought, after the earthquake, that we’d have a fresh start,” he said. “We hoped some of the money would be put to good use. But we’re worse off than ever.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Oscars 2020: British actress Cynthia Erivo could make history as youngest EGOT winner Duchess has not been subjected to \u0026#39racist\u0026#39 press coverage, says Priti PatelPriti Patel defends decision to add Extinction Rebellion to anti-terrorism watch listBlack MPs complain that they are mistaken for Commons staff and each otherRussian-brokered Libya ceasefire agreement \u0026#39close\u0026#39 in diplomatic coup for PutinJournalist falls for \u0026#39drop bear\u0026#39 prank as she dons protective gear to handle cuddly koala Over 100 flood warnings issued as Storm Brendan hits the UKFormer Cuban judge launches broadside against its government for imprisoning thousands on dubious chargesHeart jab which can halve bad cholesterol in two weeks gets NHS green light Comment: The countryside is not a chocolate box world – it’s a second-class one Labour leadership: Emily Thornberry through to next round as Clive Lewis drops out \u0026#39to lend her votes\u0026#39 Senator Cory Booker drops out of Democratic primary race after disappointing poll numbersNicola Sturgeon \u0026#39extremely unlikely\u0026#39 to win legal challenge against Boris Johnson independence referendum refusalComment: Roger Scruton kept the light of conservative philosophy burning in dark times.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem?” Representative Stephen Cohen\u0026nbspasked Mr Muilenburg at one point. “These people’s relatives are not coming back. They’re gone. Your salary is still on.”Mr Muilenburg went pale, noting that the board determines his pay.After the hearings, Mr Muilenburg called Mr Calhoun, then the Boeing chair, and offered to forgo any compensation until the Max had fully returned to service. Speaking at a New York Times conference soon after that, Mr Muilenburg said he decided to give up “tens of millions of dollars” after meeting with families of victims of the crashes.How can I make sure I avoid the Boeing 737 Max?“I felt it was important for me to forgo those bonuses and send a message of responsibility,” he said.Boeing said Mr Calhoun, who starts as chief executive Monday, would receive a base salary of $1.4m (£1m) and be eligible for an annual target bonus of $2.5m (£1.9m), long-term incentive awards worth $7.5m (£5.7m) and restricted stock units worth $10m\u0026nbsp(£7.6m).Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Princess Margaret would have been married to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, the\u0026nbspEarl of Snowdon, in 1970. They orced to much negative publicity\u0026nbspin 1978.Cox added: “It was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going ‘Ooooh’ out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn’t take in at all. She just kept saying: ‘You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you…’ She was an extraordinary creature. I excused myself and said: ‘Thank you, ma’am,’ and it came to a natural end.”The actor also discussed the Prince Andrew scandal in the interview,\u0026nbspin the context of entitlement – a key theme in dynasty drama Succession.“I mean, what an idiot,” he said. “What an outstanding dumb f***. ‘I don’t know who that young woman was, and I don’t sweat.’ It’s ridiculous!

When the chain announced that it was on the brink of falling over in the absence of a buyer or an investor, the natural reaction was to dial up a certain Queen song.\u0026nbspYou can probably already hear that thumping baseline and Freddie Mercury intoning “another one bites the dust” in your head. If the ear worm is with you for the rest of the day, my apologies.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe reports of the retailer’s troubles dovetail with some research from Colliers International, a real estate adviser that’s been keeping an eye on Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), a form of bankruptcy that’s proved quite popular with retailers.\u0026nbspThey’ve been used as a means of addressing some of the problems Beales boss Tony Brown identified on the BBC’s Today programme: high rents and the need to close unprofitable stores on long leases to cope with a trading environment mired in an ice age.\u0026nbspBoost for retailers as Carney hints at interest rate cutMost adults think retailers use too much packaging, poll claimsPrimark and Boohoo CEOs top most powerful people in fashion listCreditors, including landlords, are typically presented with a restructuring proposal that includes the closure of some stores together with reduced rents at those that remain. If a majority agree - 75 per cent is required - the minority has to lump it.\u0026nbspThese tend to be a lot harder on smaller landlords, often in the sort of places that Beales calls home, than the big ones that dominate the prime locations in big cities. They are also highly controversial in the property businesses.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspColliers added fuel to that fire. It found that out of 23 retailers that underwent a CVA from 2016 onwards, 13 of them went on to fail. They\u0026nbspended up in administration with the CVA thus serving as little more than “sticking plaster” that delayed the inevitable.\u0026nbspThe problem for landlords is that every time a client forces a rent reduction through a CVA, their other clients start queueing up to demand the same thing, some threatening CVAs of their own.\u0026nbspThere is a more optimistic way of looking at Colliers’ figures. It is that ten businesses came out the other side.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Retailers bemoan high rents, business rates, the inaction of central and local government.\u0026nbspThe root cause of both sides\u0027 problems, however, is the consumer.

Mr\u0026nbspMuilenburg also has stock options that could be worth many millions more.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We thank Dennis for his nearly 35 years of service to the Boeing Company,” the company said in a statement. “Upon his departure, Dennis received the benefits to which he was contractually entitled and he did not receive any severance pay or a 2019 annual bonus.”Boeing’s new chief executive, David Calhoun, will receive a $7m (£5.3m)\u0026nbspbonus if he is able to get the 737 Max, which has been grounded since March, safely flying again.

This is critical for long-term growth. If current political and economic uncertainties ease, we could see a gradual revival in activity over the course of the year.”Official figures released on Monday showed that the UK economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3 per cent in November. However, the downbeat message of the Stenn survey runs counter to the consensus in the City of London, which last month\u0026nbsppredicted that on average the UK economy would grow by an anaemic 1.1 per cent in 2020.There was further downbeat news on the UK economy from the retail analysts Springboard, which said there was a 2.5 per cent drop in visitors to Britain’s high streets and shopping centres in December compared with a year earlier.Diane\u0026nbspWehrle, Springboard’s marketing and insights director, said: “The reasons why this occurred are varied but reflect the caution and spending restraint of consumers which typifies low consumer confidence that has been ongoing for the last three years.”She pointed out that the timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday brought festive trading forward, leading to a noticeable decline in footfall over the two weeks leading up to Christmas.Last week saw a string of downbeat trading updates from major retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Superdry. Official figures on Friday will show whether retail sales recorded a second successive monthly fall.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko. Pam Grier was not only robbed of an Oscar for Quentin Tarantino’s classic thriller Jackie Brown, she was robbed of a nomination full stop. Conversely, her co-star Robert Forster picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. Certainly, an oversight from the Academy.Jim Carrey has been nominated for more Grammy Awards than Oscars, having picked up a nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 2006 for A Series of Unfortunate Events. The academy, sadly, has never given Carrey a fair chance, despite winning over the world in the likes of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show.Chastain has the aura of an Oscar winner. Somewhere down the line, surely one her roles won her an Oscar? Yet, despite nominations for The Help and Zero Dark, plus stand-out leading roles in films such as Molly’s Game, the actor still does not have a statuette.Of James Dean’s three credited film roles, two were nominated for Oscars – Giant and East of Eden (Rebel Without a Cause was not nominated). Only one of his films, Eden, was released before his tragic passing in 1955.The Academy members should hang their heads in shame for never nominating John Goodman, one of the finest ever character actors, for an award. Considering his brilliant performances in Raising Arizona (1987), Barton Fink (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) – and those are just his collaborations with the Coen Brothers – he must be wondering what he has to do to be acknowledged by the Academy. Salma Hayek’s career highlight, Frida, came within inches of bringing her an Oscar. Yet, it was not to be – the actor was beaten by Nicole Kidman in The Hours, and Hayak has since been ignored by the Academy.Michelle Pfeiffer was one of the most popular actors working in the 1980s and 1990s, nabbing Oscar nominations for Dangerous Liaisons (1988), The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) and Love Field (1992). However, as the ceremonies came and went, no victory followed.That Rosario Dawson has become more associated with Superheroes than awards is a tragedy. Her roles in Rent, 25th Hour and Sin City have won her praise from critics and fans alike, but there’s still not an Oscar or Golden Globe mention on her IMDB page.You\u0027d think that Angela Lansbury, having won five Tony Awards and six Golden Globes, would have at least one Oscar at home. Not so. Despite her three nominations – for Gaslight (1944), The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) – the Dame is yet to triumph at the Academy Awards. Oscar Isaac, his many fans argue, was robbed of an Oscar nomination for Inside Llewyn Davis. The critically acclaimed Coen brothers film failed to make the Best Picture cut, and poor Isaac, who played the eponymous struggling folk singer to perfection, was left without a nod. He was also overlooked for Ex Machina and A Most Violent Year.The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, Moneyball: Robin Wright has consistently left critics and audiences impressed. And while no Oscars have followed, her work on the TV series House of Card has earned her seven primetime Emmy award nominations.Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star is Born, had won acclaim across the board and looked set for Oscars glory (with a Best Actor award almost within grasp). However, Rami Malek stole victory away from him at the last moment. Perhaps the best run of his career came between 2013 and 2015, when he was nominated for three consecutive acting Oscars: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and American Sniper.You would be forgiven for presuming Joaquin Phoenix has an Oscar statuette somewhere at home. Yet the star of The Master, Walk the Line and Gladiator – all for which he was nominated – has no such award lying around. Instead, Phoenix will have to make do with a Golden Globe, a Grammy (for his work on the Walk the Line soundtrack) and a People’s Choice Award.Angela Bassett has had one of the most prolific careers in Hollywood history, starring in dozens of TV shows and films. Her roles in What\u0027s Love Got to Do with It (1993), Malcolm X (1992) and Music of the Heart (1999) won awards elsewhere – but not with the Academy.Sigourney Weaver on the set of the original Alien film in 1979Despite playing multiple roles that seem like certain Oscar winners, David Oyelowo has never even been nominated for an award. His role as Martin Luther King Jr in 2014’s Selma has gone down as one of the biggest snubs in recent history and was one of many incidents that led to the #OscarsSoWhite movement.One of the most iconic actors of all time, Marilyn Monroe never received an Oscar nomination. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Some Like It Hot (1959) may have gone down as classics, but Monroe never stood out enough for the Academy.The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Miller\u0027s Crossing, Con Air, Armageddon, Big Fish, The Death of Stalin and Barton Fink... just several films Steve Buscemi was not nominated for an Oscar for. In fact, Buscemi has never been nominated for an Academy Award.Three Oscar nominations for Woody Harrelson, and three loses for Woody Harrelson – Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), The Messenger (2009) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). But, like that widely shared Zombieland GIF, Harrelson will be wiping away the tears with a wedge of dollar bills, his films having made more than $3 billion at the box office worldwide.Mia Farrow may have starred in the classics Rosemary’s Baby, Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, but not a single nomination followed. Surprising for someone who has won three Baftas and a Golden Globe.While many people suspected Idris Elba would score an Oscar nomination for Beasts of No Nation, the Academy’s hatred for Netflix proved too strong (Bafta and the Globes nominated him instead). Even other prime Oscar-bait – Molly’s Game, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Second Coming – failed to land Elba any nominations. No wonder, perhaps, that the actor has stuck primarily to multi-million-dollar blockbusters.Having had acclaimed roles in American History X, Fight Club and Birdman, Edward Norton will no doubt go down as one of America’s most talented actors. Unfortunately, the actor has no Oscars to show it.By starring in both Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring, Scarlett Johansson shot herself slightly in the foot in 2003. For the two roles, she landed double Leading Actress nominations at Bafta (winning for Translation) and two Globes nominations. The Oscars? Not one. And despite standout roles in Lucy, Under the Skin, Match Pint, A Love Song for Bobby Long, she still has never been nominated for an Oscar.Samuel L Jackson is one of the most prolific actors working in Hollywood and has one Oscar nomination – for Pulp Fiction (1995). Considering he’s ranked as the highest all-time box office star, having made over $12 billion worldwide, the Avengers actor’s probably not all that upset.GettySamuel L Jackson poses at a portrait session during day three of the 13th annual Dubai International Film FestivalWith four Oscar nominations under her belt, Michelle Williams somehow still has no statuette placed on her mantelpiece. Her closest call came in 2016, when she starred in Manchester By the Sea, when she was up against the supreme Viola Davis, who went on to win the award for Fences.Few actors can attest to being as hardworking as Annette Bening. Revered for her work onstage, she also won acclaim for Oscar-nominated on-screen roles in The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999) and The Kids Are Alright (2010). That she was completely overlooked for 20th Century Women in 2017 was a glaring oversight. Kirk Douglas was a leading man in Hollywood’s Golden Age, his roles in Spartacus, Lust for Life and Champion inspiring a generation of actors after him. Still, the actor never won a competitive Oscar – only an honorary one in 1996, for his 50 years in the creative industry.Irene Dunne – nominated five times – is one of the few recipients of the Kennedy Centre Honours for her service to the performing arts. Yet her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948) all went unrewarded by the Academy.One of the world’s most accomplished character actors, Arthur Kennedy was best known for his supporting roles in films such as Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957) and Some Came Running (1958), all of which won him Oscar nods. And despite a leading actor nomination in 1951 for Lights Out, Kennedy still couldn’t manage a win.One of Britain’s premiere Shakespearean actors, Albert Finney was nominated five times across almost four decades, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), Under the Volcano (1984) and Erin Brockovich (2000).Six-time nominee Dame Deborah Kerr famously failed to win for the musical The King and I – losing to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. Thankfully, the Academy realised their error years later, awarding Kerr an honorary award and calling her “a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance.Another actor with six nominations and no wins. Even a role in 1950s All About Eve, which would win Best Picture, couldn’t push Thelma Ritter to victory. She went on to be nominated four more times that decade, for The Mating Season (1951, With a Song in My Heart (1952), Pickup on South Street (1953), and Pillow Talk (1959).Another much-nominated actor without a win, Glenn\u0027s most recent Close shave came at the 2019 Oscars, when she was nominated for The Wife. She has previously been nominated six time, including roles in The World According to Garp (1982). Fatal Attraction (1987), and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) .Amy Adams comes just behind Close, with six nominations (including The Fighter, The Master and American Hustle). None of those were for Arrival, the sci-fi film that saw Adams pick up Bafta, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote.Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.Peter O\u0027Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O\u0027Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.Jake Gyllenhaal has been nominated for one Oscar – for Brokeback Mountain.

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

Alex PollardThe streaming platform missed out on Best Picture last year, despite a rather successful awards campaign for Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. It’s certainly not giving up this year, with Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story landing in several key categories. Both films are now in competition for Best Picture and the cast of Marriage Story has scored nominations in the Best Actor, Best\u0026nbspActress and Best Supporting Actress categories, while The Irishman is up for Best Director as well as Best Supporting Actor (times two, with Joe Pesci and Al Pacino competing against each other). (CM)Tom Hanks scores his first Oscar nomination in nearly 20 yearsIt might be hard to believe, given that he’s barely ever put a foot wrong, but this is Tom Hanks’s first Oscar nomination in almost two decades.\u0026nbspDespite stellar work in the likes of Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr Banks (2013) and The Post (2017), the 63-year-old international treasure hasn’t been recognised by the academy since 2001’s Cast Away. (AP)Parasite, Bong Joon-ho’s razor-sharp social satire, is the first South Korean film ever to be nominated for Best Picture. It’s swept the board elsewhere, too, with Bong getting a Best Director nod (the only non-white person in an all-male category). It would have been nice to see some of the actors getting recognised – particularly Song Kang-ho, who gave one of the best performances of his already-illustrious career as the wiley patriarch – but it seems that was a dream too big. (AP)Greta Gerwig gets overlooked for Best DirectorGerwig’s acclaimed adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel is up for Best Picture, but Gerwig herself was entirely deserving of a nomination in the Best Director category. Besides, including her would have been a wonderful way to infuse some ersity into the overwhelmingly male list of nominees. Which brings us to… (CM)Where are the female filmmakers?At the risk of sounding like a broken record, once again, a major awards ceremony has only put forward male filmmakers in the race for Best Director. This is unforgivable at any given time, but it seems especially unfair given that female filmmakers put out some of the best releases of the past 12 months – just look at Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers, Alma Har\u0027el’s Honey Boy, Marielle Heller\u0027s A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u0026nbspand Lulu Wang\u0027s The Farewell. (CM)‘Congratulations to those men’ – what are the Oscars even for anymore?Jennifer Lopez deserved a shot at Best ActressIn order to prepare for her role in Hustlers, Lopez learnt an entire new skill (pole dancing, which, in case you’re wondering, is far from easy) – and that’s just the cherry on top of her very strong acting performance as veteran stripper Ramona Vega. She certainly deserved a prime spot on the list of Best Actress nominees, but alas, the Academy decided otherwise. (CM)Will Brad Pitt finally get an Oscar?The actor has been a favourite as Best Supporting Actor this awards season, and now he’s officially got a shot at an Oscar in that category. His performance as Cliff Booth in Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood could\u0026nbspearn the 56-year-old\u0026nbspthe first Academy Award of his career, after being nominated for Best Actor in Moneyball\u0026nbsp(2012) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u0026nbsp(2009), and for Best Supporting Actor in 12 Monkeys\u0026nbsp(1996). (CM)There\u0027s still some hope for\u0026nbspLittle WomenWhile Gerwig was snubbed for Best Director, her film is officially up for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Original Score. Saoirse Ronan is up for Best Actress for her turn as Jo March, while Florence Pugh is in the running for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Amy. (CM)Taron Egerton misses out on a slot for Best ActorThe English actor took home a Golden Globe in the Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance as Elton John, but didn’t secure a similar nomination on the Oscars side. In fact, Rocketman is nominated in just one category: Best Original Song for “I’m Gonna Love Me Again”. (CM)The 2020 Oscar nominations in fullAntonio Banderas scores his first Oscar nominationThe 59-year-old actor is in the running for Best Actor for his celebrated performance in Pain and Glory. This is the first Academy Award nomination of his career, and it puts him in competition with Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Jonathan Pryce and Joaquin Phoenix. (CM)No love for Uncut GemsAdam Sandler was considered a strong contender for a Best Actor nomination after his acclaimed performance in Uncut Gems, but the Academy has expressed different views by keeping him out of the category. Fans are furious. (CM)What happened to The Farewell?Lulu Wang’s film has distinguished itself on several occasions this awards season – including when Awkwafina won Best Actress – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes. Nevertheless, The Farewell as well as its stars (Zhao Shuzhen and Awkwafina had both generated some Oscar chatter) weren’t recognised by the Academy. (CM)The 2020 Oscars will take place on 9 February.

On\u0026nbspone side of it are the terrestrial planets, like Earth and Mars, and on the other are the distant jovians, like Jupiter and Saturn – the two groups made of different materials and looking fundamentally separate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe ide is not immediately obvious if you were to look at the solar system, and is located in an empty piece of space, near Jupiter. But the differences between the worlds either side of it can be immense.On the side nearest the sun, the planets and asteroids have relatively little amounts of organic molecules, for instance, but on the other side alost everything is made up of materials rich in carbon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But the question of how that came to be, and why the materials from the inner and outer parts of the solar system did not mix, has continued to perplex scientists.Scientists explain the mysterious stripes spotted on an alien moonNow scientists have proposed an answer, in a new paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy.They say the solution might lie in the very beginnings of the solar system, and our young sun, when all that surrounds us today existed as a disc around the star. The differences between the planets began even before they had been formed, scientists said.The most likely explanation for that compositional difference is that it emerged from an intrinsic structure of this disk of gas and dust, said\u0026nbspStephen\u0026nbspMojzsis, on of the authors of the paper.Such discs have been found around other distant, young stars. And so the scientists suggest that if we had one of our own, it could have created the great ide.It served as a barrier that pulled the materials into different parts of the early solar system – and which would go on to form its planets.But the barrier did let some materials through, and on Earth those would be the ones that would go on to help form life.Those materials that might go to the Earth would be those volatile, carbon-rich materials,\u0026nbspMojzsis\u0026nbspsaid. And that gives you water. It gives you organics.Previously, researchers have suggested that Jupiter was the cause of the ide. But by conducting computer simulations of what it would have done in the early solar system, the researchers found that it was not big enough to get in the way of the flow of rocky material on its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is something we should be open and honest about. Brushing it under the carpet will not get us closer to solving the issue.Brexit campaign had ‘racism at heart’, says Labour leader contender“Unfortunately, calling things how they are has not been a quality which we have come to expect from many in positions of responsibility on these matters. People who should know better are too quick to spout to politically correct mantras and too slow to call out problems in certain communities, hindering our ability to get to the bottom of the issue and leaving many residents and victims feeling like they don’t have a voice.”Continuing to link crime to immigrant communities, he\u0026nbspcriticised people “who say we should be eternally tolerant of bad behaviour, which may be rife in other countries but is not traditionally in ours” and said integration must include “learning English, respecting women and obeying our laws”.Responding to the claims, a spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbspIpswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE) condemned the article as “entirely evidence-free”.They said: “The recent article on the topic of crime in the EADT by the newly elected MP for Ipswich is at best disappointing and at worst an ill judged piece of dogwhistling.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He seems to have rather shot from the hip on this issue and misjudged us without making real effort to understand the town and its communities first.​“The best way to tackle crime is to invest in our communities, courts, the CPS, legal aid, etc,\u0026nbspand not pit communities against each other.”Created with Sketch.Big beasts lose their seats: Prominent MPs gone in election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the Conservatives310 Anna Soubry - The Independent Group for ChangeLeader of The Independent Group for Change, formerly Conservative MP, Anna Soubry lost her Broxtowe seat, coming third behind the winning Conservatives and LabourProminent Remain-backing MP Grieve lost the contest for Beaconsfield, coming second to the Conservatives, his former partyLuciana Berger lost the contest for Finchley and Golders Green, coming second to Conservative Mike FreerProminent Corbyn ally Laura Pidcock lost her Durham North West seat to Conservative Richard HoldenProminent anti-Brexit MP Chukka Umunna lost the contest for the Cities of London \u0026amp Westminster, coming second to Conservative Nickie AikenFormer candidate for Mayor of London Zac Goldsmith lost his Richmond Park seat to Liberal Democrat Sarah OlneyFormer leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds lost his Belfast North seat to Sinn FeinLabour MP Gareth Snell lost his Stoke-on-Trent central seat to the ConservativesIn response to criticism, Mr Hunt said he would be meeting with the ISCRE but doubled down on his comments.He told one Twitter user that the claims in his column “align with the views of the vast majority of people I spoke to on the doorsteps during the election campaign” and insisted that “if\u0026nbspthere is an issue with one community and there is evidence of it, then it should be looked into”.In a statement, the MP said his article was “a direct result of the conversations I have had with tens of thousands of Ipswich residents over the past few months”.\u0026nbspHe said: “The number one issue raised with me on the doorstep were concerns about crime and antisocial behaviour, particularly in the town centre.“The vast majority of Ipswich residents I spoke to believe that if it is the case that certain crimes and negative behaviours are disproportionately committed by one community, then this should be looked at and the problem tackled.“The problem shouldn’t be brushed under the carpet.

This is critical for long-term growth. If current political and economic uncertainties ease, we could see a gradual revival in activity over the course of the year.”Official figures released on Monday showed that the UK economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3 per cent in November. However, the downbeat message of the Stenn survey runs counter to the consensus in the City of London, which last month\u0026nbsppredicted that on average the UK economy would grow by an anaemic 1.1 per cent in 2020.There was further downbeat news on the UK economy from the retail analysts Springboard, which said there was a 2.5 per cent drop in visitors to Britain’s high streets and shopping centres in December compared with a year earlier.Diane\u0026nbspWehrle, Springboard’s marketing and insights director, said: “The reasons why this occurred are varied but reflect the caution and spending restraint of consumers which typifies low consumer confidence that has been ongoing for the last three years.”She pointed out that the timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday brought festive trading forward, leading to a noticeable decline in footfall over the two weeks leading up to Christmas.Last week saw a string of downbeat trading updates from major retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Superdry. Official figures on Friday will show whether retail sales recorded a second successive monthly fall.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Sarraj’s delegation also insisted in statements to media that it had refused to sit down with Mr Haftar.It was nonetheless a stunning and unexpected turn in the Libya conflict, and another instance of Mr Putin using the levers of diplomacy to put his imprint on the geopolitics of the Middle East and north Africa. France, Italy, Germany and other European and Arab powers scrambled to catch up.“Until a few weeks ago the Europeans were happy\u0026nbsptaking their sweet time,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a north Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank. “Now what we’re seeing is not about concrete peace as about a change of venue and the emergence of Moscow as the superpower that all the actors are happy to speak with.”Created with Sketch.Protests against Turkey sending forces to Libya Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman brandishing a rifle takes part in a demonstration held by Libyans and Syrians in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi to protest against Turkey\u0027s prospective military interventionTurkish members of parliament vote to send Turkish troops to Libya.

Western Libyan forces rallied and prevented him from entering the capital.\u0026nbspTurkey, a strong backer of Mr Sarraj’s government, in recent weeks began to deploy troops, allied Syrian fighters, and sophisticated military hardware to Libya to counter Mr Haftar’s forces, which are backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\u0026nbspTurkey’s overt intervention and its escalating influence in Libya has prompted alarm in France and among other backers of Mr Haftar, including eastern Mediterranean countries worried about Ankara’s attempts to lay claim to offshore gas reserves.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Abdel ​Fattah ​el-Sisi, Egypt’s president and Mr Haftar’s primary backer and mentor, conferred with Angela Merkel, the\u0026nbspGerman chancellor, over Libya.\u0026nbspGermany now says it plans to hold long-planned Libya peace talks in Berlin on 19 January.\u0026nbspItaly, Libya’s former colonial overlord, also appeared eager to re-engage in the Libya matter.Despite praise for the deal in the Turkish press, experts say the prospects for a lasting peace are dim. Though Mr Sarraj​ and Mr Haftar\u0026nbspare in Moscow there is no plan for the two men to meet.\u0026nbspMr Sarraj commands a measure of loyalty from the powerful armed factions that are pillars of the Government of National Accord but has little control over them. Mr Haftar could be using the peace talks to consolidate gains and buy time to rearm after his recent taking of the central Libyan city of Sirte. In the days since the ceasefire went into effect both sides have accused the other of violating its terms.\u0026nbspTurkey sends troops and electronic warfare tools to Libya Turkey approves deployment of troops to Libya in high-stakes battleTrump will come last in the Mediterranean gas race over LibyaBy wading into Libya, Erdogan risks a major Mediterranean conflictUS military drone ‘shot down by Russian forces in Libya’Mr Haftar may have ultimately acceded to the talks under pressure from his Egyptian and Emirati backers, who were lobbied by Mr Putin. “He’s cornered,” said Mr Harchaoui. “He’s already been given far more time and resources than he initially asked for. He cannot keep asking for more time. The Emiratis know they have time to fine tune the picture later on.”Mr Putin also has a history of making flashy diplomatic announcements in order to increase Russia’s diplomatic leverage and standing, only to walk away and let others deal with the fallout when agreements flounder and the shooting resumes.\u0026nbsp“It’s premature to talk about peace,” said Anas el-Gomati, a founder of the Sadeq\u0026nbspInstitute, a think tank focused on Libya. “The ceasefire will be temporary. It’s not designed to be operational. It’s designed for consumption. Russia is not interested in Libya. It’s interested in using Libya to pressure Europe and Turkey.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He wants to show voters that the country has moved on and the Government is once more focusing on the domestic issues voters care about.But however much he tries, it will be hard to make these talks boring. They are important and there is already DRAMA BREWING.Boris saw the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street this week. The pair got on well in their hour-long meeting. They both want these talks to be less acrimonious than the orce negotiations both want a more cordial tone.The pair reminisced about the school they had both attended in Brussels. Unlike Eton, it didn’t have playing fields, and until Johnson arrived the only game in the playground was marbles. He introduced some more rough and tumble.No were pleased that von der Leyen, rather than the more confrontational Michel Barnier, took the lead. As one No source points out, the EU loathed the lack of clarity and authority under Theresa May: She wasn’t clear what she wanted and it wasn’t certain that she could deliver what she wanted.With Boris and his new majority it is very dferent. He was able to point von der Leyen to the Tory manesto’s commitments on the future trade deal and say this was his mandate and that he was determined to deliver it.Yet despite the pair’s attempt to maintain a friendly tone, there are already tensions. Boris is irritated that the EU keeps saying it is nigh-on impossible to negotiate a full trade deal by December , despite having signed up to a political declaration that commits it to trying to do just that.The DANGER is that the EU thinks that under time pressure Boris will bend, that he will either extend the transition period — something he has repeatedly promised not to do — or drop his commitment to breaking away from EU rules and regulations.Boris is determined not to do either of these things. He doesn’t want to extend and believes in the value of the UK having the right to do things dferently.Both sides have frequently misunderstood each other in this process. Both sides must now realise that the other means what it says. Unless they do, there is going to be an almighty bust-up and no trade deal at the end of all this.THERE will be a National Security Council meeting later this month to decide whether or not to allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved in the construction of the UK’s G network.This is an issue of fierce debate in Whitehall. Under Theresa May, it led to the then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s sacking from government.Hawkish figures inside government fear No is leaning towards allowing Huawei’s involvement. One complains that Downing Street’s timetable for the technology’s roll-out is, “not realistic”, but that this time pressure means it will need Huawei involved. However, I understand that the Americans are pushing very hard for the UK to bar Huawei.One senior US government national security figure has been in London this week to lobby directly on this point.Before he makes a decision on Huawei, Boris Johnson should consider the damage it could do to Britain’s most important security relationship – the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand.Eventhe UK thinks it can manage Huawei’s involvement,our allies do not then we shouldn’t proceed. It is simply not worth the risk of undermining such a vital alliance.Don’t expect his approach to change. His holidays will be far more glam than Cameron and May’s were.THE most common reason British governments fail is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor fall out.If No and the Treasury – the most powerful department in government – aren’t on the same page, nothing gets done.Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are determined to avoid this fate. In the run-up to the Budget on March , there will be a huge effort to make sure that the Treasury and No work together.One Johnson ally tells me the two men will have a Budget-focused meeting at the start of each week to make sure they are in agreement on the key issues.Then their teams will meet again mid-week to assess progress. Javid, whose job is safe in the coming reshuffle, is determined to show that the Treasury is capable of delivering on Boris Johnson’s agenda of levelling up across the country.Those close to him are confident that they can put meat on the bones of No’s plan.AT Cabinet this week it was impressed on ministers that one of the most important events this year is COP, the climate change conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November.The UK Government wants to use the event to show how Britain can lead on clean growth post-Brexit.I understand there will be a steady drum beat of announcements on this front throughout the year: The Tories want to show they are helping create new green-collar jobs.They also hope that by holding the event in Scotland, they can emphasise the benefits of the Union.THE Labour leadership contest has yet to catch fire.The Tories are not particularly concerned about any of the candidates.Though there is some hesitation about how they would handle PMQs with Jess Phillips, who likes to make very personal attacks on Boris Johnson.But the most interesting candidate in the race is Lisa Nandy.She seems to have the clearest understanding of why Labour lost.Her bid is starting to have faint echoes of David Cameron’s successful tilt at the Tory leadership in .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me.

Harry and Meghan expect to still have a handle on royal duty but also to lead a private le.What they mean by living financially independent, I don’t know. They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough.

being “a cause for sorrow,” the decision by Harry and Meghan to quit the Firm and relocate to Canada could instead be “a wonderful opportunity for both the Royal Family and our country at large”.He says the move would also bolster the monarchy’s reputation internationally and give the UK “an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union”.He points to a poll that found six in ten Canadians were in favour of Prince Harry becoming Governor General of Canada.Mr Fabricant says Prince Harry would be “well-suited to this role” due to his “valiant service in the Army” and charity work.The Governor is formally appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Canadian PM to carry out her constitutional and ceremonial duties in the country.The current incumbent is Julie Payette, an astronaut from Quebec, who has served since .Governors usually serve for five years but there is no constitutional timeframe.Mr Fabricant says that while she has done a “sterling job,” nobody has the “same kind of box office appeal that Harry does”.In his letter he writes: “As Your Majesty will no doubt be aware, the decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to step back from their royal duties to spend more time in North America has caused quite a stir among your loyal subjects.“While many disapprove of this, may I make the case that this can in fact be a wonderful opportunity for both the Royal Family and our country at large  A challenge could be turned to a huge triumph.”He adds: “While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.”“Installing Harry as Governor General would not only bolster support for the Monarchy internationally, but also provide Canada, and by extension the United Kingdom, an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union.“There is also little doubt that Harry would be well-suited to this role.His valiant service in the Army, as well as his numerous charity works, give him more than enough experience to serve as Your Majestys representative to Canada.”As Your Majesty will no doubt be aware, the decision by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to step back from their royal duties to spend more time in North America has caused quite a stir among your loyal subjects.While many disapprove of this, may I make the case that this can in fact be a wonderful opportunity for both the Royal Family and our country at large  A challenge could be turned to a huge triumph.The departure of the Sussexes from these shores need not be a cause for sorrow. A recent Postmedia poll in Canada found that over % there were in favour of Prince Harry becoming the Governor General of Canada.The poll also showed that it was younger Canadians who would be most in favour of such a move, and that even in the generally French republican province of Quebec, almost half would also support this.The current Governor General, Julie Payette, who has been in post since , has done a sterling job. However, neither she, nor anyone  who has previously held this position, possess the same kind of box office appeal that Harry does.While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.Installing Harry as Governor General would not only bolster support for the Monarchy internationally, but also provide Canada, and by extension the United Kingdom, an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union.Procedurally, there would be few barriers to making this a reality. The Governor General is appointed to the role on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister, and while the convention is for the Governor General to serve for around five years, there are no specic constitutional requirements for this.Thus,this is something Harry himself wished to do, a call from Her Majesty to Justin Trudeau would go a long way in pushing this along.I have the honour to remain, Madam, Your Majesty’s most humble and obedient servant.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

We could call it the EUK. As for Megxit, the only way to remove the political risks of Royals who leave the tent is for the tent to go with them. For both, people can believe they have wrought a great change, while in reality their lives stay comfortably the same. The Queen would never really resign - butthe Good Monday Agreement is good enough, Harry and Meghan will have the right to self-identy as rule-breaking billionaire philanthropists, just so long as they donapost break any rules.

Speaking in Dagenham, east London the Wigan MP said the party was in retreat.On Brexit she said that a Labour leadership ided between Leave and Remain had left candidates in an impossible position.She added: The choice: to be for Labour, or to be for your community. You could not be both. I promise you that under my leadership this will never, ever happen again. Her speech, which came as MPs and MEPs nominations closed, saw Ms Nandy reject calls that the party should be forced to choose between voters in big cities and those in Labouraposs traditional heartlands. She told activists: The stark reality is the path back to power runs not along our red wall but across a red bridge that connects our towns and cities and stretches from Dagenham to Fulham, Aberdeen to Glasgow, and Cardf to Wrexham. She slammed those who had accepted that Labour must choose between progress and tradition, describing it as a lie peddled by those who seek to defeat us, that we are locked into a tug of war and we must choose: between working and middle class, leave and remain, north and south, young and old, towns and cities.

Tom Hunt, who won Ipswich from Labour last month, was accused of ill-judged dogwhistling for a column in his local newspaper. Mr Hunt did not say in his column - or a defence of it - which communities he was referring to. But approached by the Mirror today, he suggested he was referring to groups of Eastern European mean in Ipswich town centre. The -year-old said: “One of the things I mentioned in my article was groups of young men in the town centre - often , , acting in a certain way which makes other people in the town feel uncomfortable.  Askedthat was the community he was talking about he replied: “For example,you look at the comments made by Police Superintendent Kerry Cutler from Suffolk, she made the comment that actually in lots of Eastern European communities, particularly the Roma community, lots of young men tend to socialise in large groups in the town centre. “So that’s just - it just seems as though that’s just something they tend to do.” The MPaposs column last Friday in the East Anglian Daily Times said: It is impossible to start thinking about remedies to these issues without also being ready to confront the possibility that a disproportionate number of crimes are committed by iniduals from certain communities. This is something we should be open and honest about. Brushing it under the carpet will not get us closer to solving the issue. Unfortunately, calling things how they are has not been a quality which we have come to expect from many in positions of responsibility on these matters. People who should know better are too quick to spout to politically correct mantras and too slow to call out problems in certain communities, hindering our ability to get to the bottom of the issue and leaving many residents and victims feeling like they donapost have a voice.It went on to attack politically correct mantras and warn against being eternally tolerant of bad behaviour which may be re in other countries. It added: We must acknowledge the many benefits of immigration and respect peopleaposs dferent cultural backgrounds while insisting that those who join our community meet us halfway when it comes to integration. This includes learning English, respecting women and obeying \u2028our laws. A spokesman for the Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality told the East Anglian Daily Times the article was at best disappointing and at worst an ill-judged piece of dogwhistling.

They put “blood, sweat and tears” into the two-bed dump, bought under a council regeneration scheme. Debbie and Ste were shaken when they first stepped through the door – armed with a £, schedule of works from Liverpool City Council to bring it up to scratch. The th century terraced house had been hit by fire and had crumbling walls, broken bricks and burnt joists. But the couple worked -, did most of the renovations themselves and in  months transformed it into a cosy home for just £,. After enjoying their first Christmas in the double-fronted home in the city’s Wavertree district, the pair have been buoyed by a valuation of £,. Debbie, , says: “We never want to move because we have put so much of ourselves into this house. People thought we were nuts. “We’ve crawled on the floors, we built the floors… it’s a gamble we took and we love it. Our blood and guts have gone into it. If they’d give us next door, we’d do it again!” Recalling the first time she saw the property, Debbie says: “It was just a shell. All the joists were burnt. It was terrible. “Honestly, it was just stacks and stacks of bricks. There was nothing. My family were saying to me, ‘You’re mad’.”  Every floor had to be replaced, chimneys were removed, the sinking kitchen was underpinned, all fittings were ripped out and the windows were upgraded. Debbie and Ste, , used their savings and took a small loan to complete the work – and it was hard graft. We were there until midnight with torches. We went seven days a week, we didn’t miss a day,” Debbie says. She scoured local ads for bargains and bagged a £, kitchen for a tenth of the price and a £, bathroom suite for £,. They also picked up a slightly damaged £, front door for £.  And, slowly but surely, the place came together. Now it is a shining example of how Liverpool is breathing new le into former slums. The council unveiled its Homes For A Pound scheme in . A year later, bosses vowed that , empty houses would be brought back into use. Since then, , homes have been reoccupied – including  in the Webster Triangle, Wavertree, where the Hodges live. Seven more families are due to move in soon. A similar scheme has since been launched in Stoke-on-Trent. Last year, a Channel  documentary about the renovations in Liverpool featured Debbie and Ste.  The couple say the sense of community in the Webster Triangle is a great example of how councils candepressed areas to homely neighbourhoods. The Hodges used to rent in Anfield and had struggled to get a mortgage. Debbie suffered a serious long-term illness and Ste’s wages as a carpet cleaner were not enough to secure a home loan. Debbie says: “The council scheme was the best thing to happen to us. It brings communities together. When we moved in, there were only about three houses in the road occupied. But it’s moving on now, it’s coming to be more of a community and about half the street is filled.  “We’ve met all the neighbours and introduced ourselves. People come from everywhere, dferent areas, dferent countries. It’s a lovely community and I’m really settled here. I just love it. Once a month we clean the street and make it nice. The area is coming up, there are bars and restaurants opening further down the road… I just wouldn’t move. “I can definitely see the area getting better and we’ve never been so happy.” The couple have two daughters – Jade, , a psychologist who has her own home, and -year-old teaching assistant Jenna, who still lives with her parents and is studying for an MSC. Debbie hopes the Homes For A Pound scheme will help young Liverpudlians like Jenna get on the property ladder.

Cash-strapped Michael and Linda Chatha have broken up and decided to raffle off Shrubbery Farm, in Longnor, Shrewbury, after struggling to find a buyer. A £ ticket includes stamp duty and legal fees, with the couple, who have lived at the property  years, hoping to sell , to meet the valuation and cover other fees. They were inspired by another home owner who sold over £ million-worth of tickets for his £,-valued property. Michael said with he and Linda deciding to go their separate ways, they put the cottage on the market last year but failed to find a buyer probably because of the housing market and Brexit. The cottage, just an houraposs drive from Birmingham, also includes The Granary - a self-contained annex, and is estimated to have doubled in value in  years. If , tickets arenapost sold, the lucky winner can instead take away  per cent of the receipts, butthe raffle rakes in more than expected the Chathaaposs will make a big donation to Hope House. The charity supports children with le-limiting illnesses and their families. Michael, originally from Sutton Coldfield and dad to Charlie, , and Jack, , said it was a privilege to have lived in their dream country cottage since .  The idyllic property boasts exposed beams throughout every room and a farmhouse style kitchen with an oil-fired AGA and walk-in pantry. It backs onto a th century church and Longnor Hall, with its medieval deer park, which means it is very secluded with almost no neighbours. While a primary school, rated aposOutstandingapos by Ofsted, is within walking distance. Shrewsbury town is a quarter of an hour up the road, and Church Stretton and Ludlow are close, while the Welsh coast is just  minutes down the road. I was born and bred in Sutton Coldfield and when we had Charlie we used to come out here to go to a country pub and said it would be wonderful to find a place to live here, said Michael, who works in marketing for a software company.  It was more than we could afford but we said you only live once so we stretched ourselves and itaposs been a wonderful home and a great investment. Our children went to the Ofsted-rated Outstanding school up the road and the local community is great. Ludlow, with all its lovely restaurants, is only  minutes away, you can be in Birmingham and Chester within an hour, and within  minutes you can be dipping your feet in the water in Aberdovey in Wales.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle are planning to communicate privately via WhatsApp during todayaposs unprecedented summit, it has been claimed. Harry, , will join the Queen, , Prince Charles, , and Prince William, , for crunch talks about his future in a matter of hours at Sandringham. Meghan, , who reportedly flew to Canada a few days ago, is said to hope to take part in the meeting via a conference call. And it is claimed the former actress will use the popular phone messaging app to exchange strategies with her husband.A royal source claimed to The Sun: “They want to be able to chat one-to-one as the main players delve into the nitty-gritty of their breakaway.”The extraordinary negotiations come after the couple announced they would be aposstepping backapos as senior royals and plan to become financially independant. Kensington Palace did not wish to comment. Meanwhile, the Queen is to chair todayaposs crisis talks as she joins her family to thrash out a plan for Harry and Meghan. The historic meeting at her private estate will be the first time Harry has met with his grandmother, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge since the issue engulfed the royal family this week, making headlines around the world. The couple triggered a aposroyal crisisapos by announcing last week they would be stepping back from their duties and spending more time in North America.  It is claimed the couple consulted neither the Queen nor Charles on the announcement, made on Instagram and their own website, a step seen as impertinent and premature. Harry and Meghan said they wanted to carve out a progressive new role for themselves and work to become financially independent. But it was unclear how the couple will become what royal biographers said was akin to being a half royal - and who will pay for their transatlantic lestyles. Meghan has ed to Canada to be with their son Archie after the couple spent six weeks in the country in late .  The duchess flew to Canada a few days ago where the family spent an extended festive break in the province of British Columbia. It is thought William will be travelling to the estate in Norfolk from his Kensington Palace apartment and Harry from Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle. Charles was in Oman to attend a condolence ceremony following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, and was due to travel back to the UK on Sunday evening. The Queen attended church at Sandringham on Sunday where wellwishers expressed sympathy for her, and clapped as she left, with some members of the public saying that Harry and Meghan should not receive any more taxpayersapos money.  The monarch was pictured arriving for the service wearing a hearing aid for what is believed to be the first time in public. Harry and Meghan are said to have left the Queen feeling hurt by their bombshell announcement that they plan to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. There are a range of issues to be discussed today, and it is likely the royals will try to come to some agreement before the meeting ends to stop the immediate crisis causing lasting damage to the monarchy. Harry and Meghanaposs statement - and a new official Sussexroyal website - have thrown up important questions about funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles.  Other important issues to resolve include who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly America. It is not known what time the family plan to meet, how long the summit is expected to last or whether the entire day has been set aside to find a solution. Before the meeting, the royals will be given written proposals produced by their offices and others, including relevant government departments from the UK and Canada, where it is thought Harry and Meghan will establish a second home.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA Hermes delivery driver has been sacked after being caught unzipping his pants and urinating on a family home. Dan Cecchini said he felt aposviolatedapos after catching the driver in the act in December last year. His complaint to the delivery giant prompted the company to fire their worker. Dan was in the bath on December  when his security system alerted him on his phone to movement outside his St Leonards-on-Sea home. The shocking CCTV footage showed a Hermes courier walking down steps into Danaposs property, where he appears to unzip his trousers and relieve himself in a corner. The -year-old dad-of-two then opens the window to challenge the delivery driver - only for him to act innocent and claim he was looking for his neighbour. Hermes got in touch with the audio engineer on December  and apologised aposfor the courier peeing on your propertyapos, adding that that kind of behaviour aposis not toleratedapos. But after Dan asked the courier company when the pee was going to be cleaned up, the delivery giant simply aposfobbed him offapos and told him that the aposquery [had been] resolvedapos. After his dog got wet paws in the pee, disgusted Dan has now made the area aposoff limitsapos to his children. To add insult to injury, Dan uses the spot as a delivery safe space and two more parcels were dropped off in the same spot days later, which he claims were left smelling of urine. After Hermes were contacted for comment, the delivery giant confirmed that the driver would no longer be working for them and that they would clean up the urine. Dan said: You can see him go open the zip. Itaposs clear, heaposs not putting a parcel there. Itaposs obvious. You could smell it afterwards.Someone on Facebook said aposoh look, it looks like heaposs peeing into a drainapos but thereaposs no drain there. Thereaposs a pipe, but thereaposs no drainapos.I just felt a bit violated, really. Youaposve caught someone peeing on your [property] and youaposve got evidence.  I got a notication on my phone there was movement in one of the alleys [on my property]. And I had my phone in the bath so I could see there was a driver walking down the steps. I was like aposokay they normally put the packages thereapos. That was what was pretty rank about it all. I couldnapost quite see what heaposd actually done until I looked at the video afterwards. So I just thought he was being suspicious - I couldnapost quite work out what was going on. He ended up doing a pee where all our Christmas packages get left - itaposs our safe spot with other couriers. So thataposs why I was like [to Hermes] aposyou need to come and clean this upapos because consequently other packages came and got delivered there, which is a bit grim. He could have knocked on the door and said he was desperate for the loo and I would have just said cool, hereaposs the loo. I just thought the fact that he blagged me when he was saying aposoh Iaposm just looking for somethingapos. Maybe we would have done the same thing - you just panic, I donapost know. It still hasnapost been cleaned up. We put some cardboard down but itaposs pretty grim in that itaposs rained and itaposs spread all the pee onto our decking. He scarpered off pretty quickly and thataposs annoying. Weaposve all been out and about and need to pee, I get it. But the fact that Hermes has shut us down - itaposs a simple thing to sort out.  The next day I went out to have a lookI could choose another safe space to get Amazon to not leave stuff down there after the two ASOS parcels arrived. Itaposs just annoying, I should have maybe thought about it a bit more, but thataposs pretty infuriating that weaposre having to put stuff in the shower to wipe this dudeaposs wee off it. When I turned around Peanut our dog was in there snfing and his feet were wet. Peanut got this dudeaposs pee on his wet paws so we just dumped him in the bath.

It is understood that Meghan and Harry didnapost consult any of their relatives before making their announcement on Instagram , only sending the statement to Charles and William  minutes before they told the world their intentions.There have been a number of official statements over the past few days giving an insight into how things are looking behind palace walls. Weaposve taken a look at how each member of the Royal Family responded to the news, both publicly and privately. The Queen Harryaposs grandmother is said to be deeply hurt by the Duke and Duchessapos actions and has called him to a crisis meeting at Sandringham today. It is understood Her Majesty knew little of Harry and Meghanaposs plans until reading them on an iPad at her Sandringham estate before switching on the news.Before Meghan and Harry told the world they will be stepping back from their roles as senior royals, the Duke wanted to discuss his decision with the Queen. However itaposs claimed he didnapost plan on negotiating with the Monarch, and instead just wanted to talk to her grandson to granny to explain why they were doing it. He called her up to askhe could come to Sandringham for a chat, to which she agreed, however things quickly went downhill in what has been described as a classic move by the Palace. The source added: He has been communicating with her on the phone throughout. He wanted to see her, not to negotiate with her but to talk to her grandson to granny, to say, ‘This is how we have come to this.’He called her at Sandringham, where she is still enjoying her Christmas break, and askedhe could go up to Norfolk to see her. She reportedly said: Yes, love to see you, come and see me.  But the meeting never happened, with a source claiming: A message was conveyed: ‘Oh, sorry, misunderstanding, she might have said she was available, but actually she is not available.’However the Queen made it very clear that he wasnapost to publicly announce the plans for now - but Harry is said to have ignored this, sharing the statement on Wednesday evening. Shortly afterwards the Queen released her own statement reading: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Prince Philip Furious Prince Philip is said to have barked what the hell are they playing at  after learning about Harry and Meghanaposs plan to quit royal le.  The Queenaposs husband, , was reportedly furious when he was told and is understood to have accused his grandson of disrespecting the monarch.  hilip, who retired from public le in , now spends much of his time in a farmhouse on the edge of the Norfolk estate, but is believed to have ed to the main house to comfort the disappointed Queen in the wake of the crisis.A source told The Sun on Sunday that Philip asked “what the hell are they playing at ” after being told about Harry and Meghanaposs announcement.The source added: To say that the Duke feels let down would be a considerable understatement. He is deeply hurt. “But he was spitting blood when aides informed him what had happened. Philip has accused Harry and Meghan of lacking respect and he is weary of their behaviour. Philip was today seen being driven away from the Sandringham estate ahead of the Queenaposs crisis talks with her heirs. Prince CharlesAccording to the Evening Standard , Charles and William were only sent a copy of the statement  minutes before it was made public - and they were not given any further information. Both men are said to be incandescent with rage . Harry reportedly spoke to his dad before Christmas expressing his desire to spend more time in Canada and was told to come up with a concrete plan. The couple put together a full proposal, detailing how they would make the plan work, which they sent over to Charles at the start of the New Year. However, they were reportedly told they needed to spend more time thinking it through. They were told there were complex implications that needed to be worked out.A source told The Times : It reached an impasse where his father said, ‘We need to have these conversations in person. This is not something we can negotiate over email.’The Duchess of Cambridge Kate celebrated her th birthday amid all the royal drama, with Kensington Palace ignoring all the goings on to share a gorgeous new photo of the Duchess. However she was today pictured looking strained ahead of her husband and brother-in-lawaposs crisis talks.She was photographed driving in London this morning, wearing a cream coat with her hair tied back. Prince William Wills is said to be just as angry about Harryaposs decision as his father. Over the weekend there were reports that William had spoken to a friend about his “sadness” at the broken bond with his brother in the wake of Megxit. According to the Sunday Times , he expressed sorrow that he and Prince Harry are now ‘separate entities’.The report claims the Duke told a friend: “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that anymore we’re separate entities. “I’m sad about that. All we can do, and all I can do is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we’re all singing from the same page. “I want everyone to play on the team.”However this morning he released a joint statement with his younger brother denying bullying claims ."},{"url":null,"title":"key detail meghan markle harrys","story":"NewsKey detail of Meghan Markle and Harrys quitting thats upsetting perplexed Queen the mostThe Queen reportedly didnt know much about Meghan Markle and Prince Harrys plans to step back from royal le, finding out with the rest of us when it was reported on TVShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv video prince-phillip-leaves-crisis-talks-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news key-detail-meghan-markle-harrys-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Monarch is said to have known little of Harry and Meghanaposs plans until reading them on an iPad at her Sandringham estate before switching on the news. While shes upset about their decision and how it has been handled, there is one part of their choice that has hit her particularly hard - his responsibility to his duty.An insider told Vanity Fairaposs Katie Nicholl : Perhaps it’s a generational thing, or the way she was brought up, but duty is everything to the Queen and she will find this the most upsetting part of all.They claim that a sense of duty has been instilled in her since she was a child and the crown is everything to her. They go on: At the end of the day she is  and this has been a genuine shock for her. After everything she has done for Harry she feels monumentally let down. Many other members of the Royal Family are said to be upset about the hurt Meghan and Harryaposs decision has caused for the Queen. The source added: The family are all very upset at how the Sussexes have behaved, not least because of the impact it has had on the Queen, who has a very frail husband, the whole Andrew problem to deal with and now Harry, who is frankly behaving like a bolshie teenager.

She thinks, aposItaposs not working for me.aposHowever, the Duke of Sussex, , is also said to be torn about his future, but under pressure from both sides. Meghan previously revealed in an ITV documentary how she had struggled with the media attention and that aposnot many people had askedshe was okapos.  When questioned how her physical and mental health was faring, the former actress said: Look, any woman, especially when theyaposre pregnant, youaposre really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging. And then when you have a newborn, you know  And especially as a woman, itaposs really — itaposs a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed, itaposs ... she said, trailing off. She added: Also, thank you for asking, because not many people have askedIaposm OK. But itaposs a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.  When askedthings had been a struggle, she replied yes. Harry will this afternoon come face to face with the Queen as senior royals race to thrash out plans for his and Meghanaposs future. It follows their announcement that they are aposstepping backapos and want to become aposfinancially independentapos. Todayaposs historic meeting at the Queenaposs private Sandringham estate will be the first time Harry has met with his grandmother, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge since the issue engulfed the royal family this week, making headlines around the world.  Meghan is with their baby son Archie in Canada, but a royal source said it is likely she will join the crisis talks by phone. The duchess flew to Canada a few days ago where the family spent an extended festive break in the province of British Columbia.It is thought William will be travelling to the estate in Norfolk from his Kensington Palace apartment and Harry from Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle.Charles was in Oman to attend a condolence ceremony following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, and was due to travel back to the UK on Sunday evening. The Queen attended church at Sandringham on Sunday where wellwishers expressed sympathy for her, and clapped as she left, with some members of the public saying that Harry and Meghan should not receive any more taxpayersapos money.  The -year-old monarch was pictured arriving for the service wearing a hearing aid for what is believed to be the first time in public. Harry and Meghan are said to have left the Queen feeling hurt by their bombshell announcement that they plan to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. There are a range of issues to be discussed today, and it is likely the royals will try to come to some agreement before the meeting ends to stop the immediate crisis causing lasting damage to the monarchy. Harry and Meghanaposs statement - and a new official Sussexroyal website - have thrown up important questions about funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles.  Other important issues to resolve include who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly America. It is not known what time the family plan to meet, how long the summit is expected to last or whether the entire day has been set aside to find a solution. Before the meeting, the royals will be given written proposals produced by their offices and others, including relevant government departments from the UK and Canada, where it is thought Harry and Meghan will establish a second home. It is not known who ,anyone, will be at the meeting - but it is likely the private secretaries of the four royals may join part of the talks to assist with any questions. On Thursday, the Queen, Charles and William gave orders for their households to work with the Sussexesapos team to quickly find a workable solution to their desire to change the direction of their royal lives, but still support the Queen.

Rachael Fitzgerald and partner Mark Maddocks woke at am on holiday in Crete, Greece, to find their daughter Lara unresponsive in their hotel room. Mark desperately tried to revive the tot, but she was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. Tests were carried out in Greece but experts were unable to establish a cause of death. At an inquest, a doctor said Laraaposs parents from Hale, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester may never know the reason for their daughteraposs unexpected death. The couple had been trying for eight years for their first child, and everything fell into place with the birth of their daughter in March of last year. Born at  weeks Lara was described as being the aposaposperfect little girl with a bigger social le than many adults. She would regularly be out in her buggy with her mother and was affectionately nicknamed Lady Lara. The tragedy occurred on July  last year after the family checked into the Village Heights Hotel in the Greek resort of Hersonissos. The inquest heard that Lara had recently been treated for symptoms of a cold but otherwise appeared to be in perfect health. Miss Fitzgerald told the Stockport hearing: “Her last feed that night was about pm. About am I woke up and I just looked at her though I was facing the other way and turned my head. She was just on her back and just looked very peaceful and normal but I knew that something’s not right. “I said aposLara, Laraapos but she never normally wakes till about am so it was still early really. I didn’t get a response and picked her up and her arm just slipped down and chaos went on from there. Mark grabbed her and tried to resuscitate her. She was warm she wasn’t blue.  “It doesn’t make sense. I’m obsessed with suffocation issues and you just go through these things - but nothing was near her.” Miss Fitzgerald added: aposaposLara was amazing, she liked to be in the buggy it was just a nice greyish silver cross as we didn’t know whether we were having a boy or girl - she had everything.aposapos Mr Maddocks, a Swisspirt aircraft dispatcher, said: “We tried so hard for a long time to have a child - for eight years. But in the end it all worked and Lara was so good she slept a lot and didn’t cry - she was perfect. “She went everywhere with us, she went more places than some people had been in a le time. In the three months, like some of our friends saying where’s Lady Lara lunching today  Was out all the time.” Dr Melanie Newbold, a paediatric pathologist from Manchester Royal Children’s Hospital, said: “I was able to say that Lara looked like a perfect little girl and seemed to be well grown for her age and no problems with growth. “Absolutely no signs of suffocation, no evidence whatsoever that suffocation was involved in her death. “No signs of any illness and internal organs where all perfectly normally formed. No evidence of overwhelming sepsis . Some evidence that she might have had a recent cold like almost everybody had. Other than that no positive findings. Signs of cold wouldn’t have caused her to die.  “Very rare to find evidence of why they have died. It’s not unusual sadly. aposaposOf course when doing the post mortem can identy things that we can see either by the nature of evidence or down a microscope. Many people at all ages not just babies but most frequently in babies because of something that’s happened in there body. “Might just be in the case of a baby just stopping breathing a simple reason. We don’t understand, know that they can take place but can’t identy them at post mortem as there is no evidence that this has happened. “If it was death due to over heating in the sense that she was very very hot there usually would be features here. But there’s no evidence that that was the case for her. “We used to call it sudden death syndrome or cot death, we don’t really understand all the factors might be that we never will.” In a statement read to the court, family GP Dr Helen Symcox, said: “Lara was born at  weeks. Had her first set of immunisations and was seen on June , for upper respiratory tract infection and was a bit snuffly. She was active and alert and smiling and her chest was clear.  “On June , took her to the surgery with what was thought to be another cold and was a bit snuffly and dribbling a bit. But was drinking her milk and having water so had no concerns.” The court heard how the GP spoke to her mother about using sun cream and keeping her hydrated and was happy for her to go on holiday. Recording a conclusion of death by natural causes, coroner Alison Mutch told Laraaposs parents: “It’s clear that she had quite a little personality about her. Also came over in the evidence just how well loved and looked after she was. “She had a very short le but clearly a very happy le and was very very well looked after. What we know is that she had a social le that few of us could ever aspire to and was out and about and loved being out and about. She was obviously a very sociable little girl. “As a family you made the decision to go on holiday and then went to the GP to check they where happy and she was okay for you to go away. It seems like a really lovely place you took her too although memories are very dferent now. aposaposIt seems like it was a really lovely time till the tragedy happened.

Today Prince Harry will arrive at his grandmother’s Norfolk estate, where in happier years gone by he has enjoyed warm-hearted Christmas celebrations surrounded by the love and laughter of his closest family. But his latest visit to Sandringham, after he and Meghan turned down the Queen’s invitation to join the festivities last month, will be remembered as one of the most extraordinary days in modern royal history. Summoned by the Queen to meet her, flanked by her eldest son and grandson, there will be no clearer indication of what matters above all  in this family namely, the line of succession and the monarchy. Harry will no doubt feel he is entering the lion’s den, especially without the support of his co-conspirator who has fled to Canada leaving him to face the music alone. But he would do well to remember the family, at their very core, do have his best interests at heart and are keen for him and Meghan to rein back and look at what is at stake for all involved. There would have perhaps been no need for this most extraordinary summit had their enforced and somewhat hastily arranged exit from The Firm not been so poorly executed. He has upset the Queen, angered his father, and his brother William has said the once devoted brothers are now “separate entities” and he can no longer put his arm around himhe doesn’t want to be on the “team”.

Plain and simple. While many sympathise with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s desire to step back as senior Royals, the way they chose to do it has provoked justiable shock and outrage. Petulant, hot-headed and impulsive are just some of the barbs aimed at the couple after the bombshell public announcement that they wished to become part-time Royals and live much of the time abroad. Inconsiderate, disloyal and reckless might also be appropriate. In more than  years on the throne, the Queen has shown with impeccable style, dignity and judgement how the “old firm” should be run. The sacrices she and other members of the Royal Family have made have been not only for the monarchy, but for the nation.  That, by the antiquated system of a monarchic state, is their responsibility by birth. And Her Majesty embraced that responsibility with grace, as even republicans admit. Harry and Meghan’s wish to break away might be seen as an understandable cry for modernisation. Their desire to do so has been evident for a long time. But discussing their intentions with friends such as Elton John before the Queen, and going ahead with their announcement without thinking through the full impact on their family or the monarchy, has caused a totally avoidable crisis. That the Queen has had to intervene – calling a Royal showdown at Sandringham tomorrow to deal with the crisis – is a measure of the scale of the embarrassment caused.  She is right to step in and call the wayward couple to heel. Only she has the authority to bang heads together and ensure a smoother route to whatever the future holds. The Wrong Cure  The crisis in our health service starts at the front line, the family doctor. The GP is an absolute cornerstone of the National Health Service, the first stop for all ages from cradle to grave. It is a service that is essential to personal health, and to the economy of the country. With a shortage of at least , GPs, Tory promises of more on the way are not enough. Government action on over-complicated red tape preventing overseas doctors from coming here to ease the gap is long overdue. Rocking On Rod Stewart is a national treasure who just refuses to act his age.

Jason Smith, , met Azarel Smith, now , on online dating site  Match  in February . Office manager Azarel was just  years old at the time they first agreed to meet up for a dinner date. Jason, a lawyer, said he was swept away by Azarel’s beauty as sparks flew for the couple, although they were sceptical of each other’s intentions at first. After dating on and off for the first few years, love prevailed and Jason popped the question in  during their trip to Las Vegas. The pair are now engaged and living together with plans for marriage in the near future. Jason, who was married once before, admitted he wanted to date younger women because he thought the “sex would be better” and didn’t want to be pressurised into marriage and kids. He said: “Being with a younger girl is exciting. She introduces me to new adventures, new songs, lingo etc. She has a more open mind when it comes to the world and obviously a better body. “She’s made me a much happier man. She’s supportive of me and business. Something I was missing when single. She has a way of keeping me focused and really mindful of the world. “Truthfully, I thought the sex would be better. “That she was less likely to push for immediate marriage and kids. I just really wanted a relationship where I didn’t feel like there would be that kind of pressure. “Also, I felt like I was at an age where I had the time and money to entertain someone ‘fresh’. In reality I can’t say the reason sex is better is because of age. I would have to credit it to being more in love now. “But she does have a better body than the older women I’ve dated. Which I’m sure makes things more enjoyable as well.” However, the pair abstained from sex within the first few years of their relationship under Azarel’s wishes. She said: “We abstained from sex the first few years of our relationship. Jason was very respectful of my choice and treated me like a lady. “The no sex didn’t deter him from doing nice things or loving me. Respect I wasn’t used to getting from guys.” Since they began dating, the pair have been swept up in a whirlwind romance and always teach each other new things, saying how that is a fundamental part of being in a relationship with someone. Azarel, who is interested in going to law school, said that Jason has given her much needed help and guidance when it comes to her career and even personal le.  Speaking about their relationship, she said: “You get to be with someone who has experienced more of le, so they can give really wise input to help you make better decisions. “Whether that be with your professional le, or personal le. For instance, I just finished my bachelors and trying to figure out my next steps. “I’m interested in getting into law school and Jason has been there to help me through the process since he’s already done it himself.” She added: “I’ve experienced a lot that I could have only dreamed about doing before him. For the first time in a relationship, I truly am able to be my naturally mature self and feel like I fit in. “Which I didn’t feel dating guys my age. I’ve gained a lot of confidence in myself.” However, the pair admitted they do face challenges because of their -year age gap but over the years, they have learnt how to make their relationship work, insisting how they are “best friends” before anything. Jason said: “We are so dferent. Almost too dferent to get bored of each other. Fingers crossed. “Also, we are truly best friends before anything. We’ve built a strong base for our relationship. It would take a lot for anyone to break us apart. “Azarel has a very strong personality so she can be a bit hard headed and snappy. But I know just how to ‘handle’ her. “Sometimes there’s stuff we obviously can’t relate about and the fact we are at dferent places in le. However, I don’t feel like any of that is a signicant dficulty.” Meanwhile, Azarel said: “Jason does small things like repeats everything he says to me x, and make phone calls in the car while I’m sleeping that can be very annoying.” The -year-old, who has just graduated from university with a bachelor’s degree, said that dating an older man feels much more stable than having two millennials trying to “figure out le” at the same time, which can bring added stress into a relationship. She said: “Not really, I think the relationship runs a little bit more smoothly because you don’t have two millennials trying to figure out le. When one of you are older, it feels a bit more stable.” Both Jason and Azarel’s family and friends are supportive of their relationship, though sometimes Jason receives the unsolicited advice to “watch out” when dating someone younger.

The youngster, known only as Jagannath, suffers from rare genetic skin condition called lamellar ichthyosis. The condition causes the skin to grow too fast, dry out, and shed, much like a reptileaposs. Jagannathaposs case is so severe that his skin sheds every four to six weeks. He is forced to bathe hourly and smear himself with moisturiser every three hours to try to relieve the symptoms.Shocking photos of the young boy, from the Ganjam district of eastern India, show his skin completely dried out and flaky, stretched over his body like scales. His skin has become so tight that he is often left unable to walk properly, and needs a stick to help him stretch out his limbs. Sadly, there is no cure for Jagannathaposs condition - and his father, Prabhakar Pradhan, who works as a labourer in a paddy field, can not afford the cost of his sonaposs treatment.  He said: My son has suffered this disease since childhood, and there is no cure for it. I do not have enough money to take him for a treatment and my heart breaks seeing him suffer with this cursed disease every day.  A dermatologist in the Indian district, who did not wish to be identied, said: This disease is not treatable, although some doctors say there is a cure.

She said: “I’m mad on travelling and animals and when I booked a cheap flight to Vienna I noticed that they have the oldest zoo in the world. “During our visit, I realised we nearly missed out on seeing the orangutans so we turned around and went back.  “We couldn’t see them in their enclosure so we just said ‘let’s go home’, but I realised that they had come back out when we turned away so we went to go and look. “I went to the window for a closer look and sat down by the window so my son could see the orangutan who was roughly five or six foot away – I didn’t want to frighten her so I made myself smaller so I could take a picture. “She then got up, carried a piece of cloth to the window and sat down with me. “She looked directly into my eyes then placed her hand up asto touch my son. I was in awe of this beautul creature already. “My son wanted feeding and as it was quiet I fed him whilst I sat there. “The way the orangutan reacted took my breath away she kept looking at me, then my son then back again. “She sat with me for approximately half an hour, and kept stroking the glass and lay down next to me asto support and protect me. “I was absolutely gobsmacked and got quite a crowd of people turning up to see what was going on – people were sat watching quietly and respectfully. “It was really lovely and I didn’t want to leave – it felt incredible and I was crying so much because I couldn’t take it in.”  After Gemma shared the heart-warming moment on Facebook for her friends and family to see, it went viral – racking up millions of views, likes and shares. The new mum has since discovered the orangutan, Sol, had previously given birth to a stillborn infant, making the experience even more emotional.

Some things you might get away with when it’s more open, you don’t.“Inverness were good at it last week. They sit with six players behind the ball and maybe cheat with a couple up the park and counter you well.“We need to find the answers to open teams up.”Dundee’s form going into last weekend’s clash with Caley Thistle was good with two wins and two draws in their previous four.However, consistency has consistently been the downfall for the Dark Blues this season.That four-game spell in December was their best since August and Hemmings knows it’s something the team have to improve on.He added: “We’re tired talking about it, to be honest.“We’ve had moments where we think we’re getting there and we’re away on a good run but have games like Inverness last week.“We can’t just do it for three or four games but we need seven or eight in a row to really assert ourselves.“The performances going back to the second half against Arbroath had been really good.“We’ve been positive in the way we’ve played, some good performances.“Last week was a chance to close the gap on Inverness and go level on points with them. It was disappointing in that regard.“This will be another big game because Ayr are a good team and we need to pick ourselves back up.”Tomorrow’s clash comes after tests against league leaders Dundee United, second-placed Inverness and ahead of a dficult Scottish Cup tie at home to high-flying Premiership side Motherwell.It’s a testing run for the players but Hemmings is relishing the chance to get back out and into a big match.He said: “It is good to have another big game this weekend.“We knew there were three big home games in a row with the Scottish Cup the week after.“That’s what you want – you always want to test yourself as a player.“It’s a good game to jump back into.”The last meeting with Ayr saw Dundee leave Somerset Park with an impressive - victory. That night saw plenty of tackles flying about and Hemmings expects no dferent this time around.“Whatever way they go, it’ll be a dficult game for us, we know that.“It was a tough game down there and a bit tasty as well – I expect the same this weekend.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.36732452-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.36732452-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.36732452-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.36732452-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dont blame snp for national divisions","story":"R Duncan claims the SNP is causing trouble with the English by wanting Independence .What it veries again is where British Nationalist hearts truly lie.

But there’s genuinely nothing imminent.”Despite no incomings being imminent, James is keen for fans of the club not to take that for inaction behind the scenes.He added: “We don’t want six or seven signings every window. We need to keep building every window – looking to add and get stronger with every one.“We’re fourth in the league which isn’t great but it’s a process and we need to believe in what we’re trying to do.“I’d be quite happy keeping this squad and adding a couple.“We need to make sure we’re in the play-offs with a chance to get to the Premiership and we’re looking to build a team that can compete there.“We’ll hopefully get a couple of pre-contracts done with a view to next season.”One name that has been linked with a move back to the club this month is former Dee favourite Craig Wighton.“I loved working with Wighty when he was here,” said James.“I know his character and his talent. He’s training with the reserves at Hearts but there’s nothing happening with that. Will it  I’m genuinely not sure.“Wighty got put to us at the start of the season.

My opinion hasn’t changed – I think he will be. That’s how I’ve felt all along unless something drastically changes.“I hope that’s not my heart ruling my head.“He’s been really professional in the way he’s dealt with it.“He’s an experienced player with good character. He still looks very committed in training.“He’s key to what we’re trying to do but we knew when we signed him that this might happen.“We’re prepared for whatever happens.

I said as much to our players so we are not taking positives from that.“We have been here before and come back from a poor performance before. We need to do it again.“We can’t afford to be so up and down as a team.”The majority of Dundee’s low points this season have come on their own patch.The poor defeat to Inverness added to a list that includes bad days as hosts to Dundee United, Partick, Queen of the South and League Two Elgin City.However, James doesn’t feel there is an issue for players playing at Dens Park.“I was never big on that,” he added. “I didn’t feel that as a player. vw, px\"  “The basic thing that supporters want to see is people going out there and working hard.“For  to  minutes, Inverness were much better than us and, by then, the game was effectively done as far as they were concerned as they had a lead and sat back off the match.“They were right to do that and it happened up there as well. They are really good at it.“You know that teams come here and look to get through the first  minutes or so and look to get the crowd turned against us.“That happens at clubs that have quite a bit of support.“But I genuinely don’t buy into the view that there is this big stigma or a big problem about playing at Dens.“I don’t get it and it should be the opposite because when you get it right and you get the fans right behind you it is a really good place to play.“It flips and becomes a good place to play football.“The atmosphere can be really good but I have said it before and I will say it

The feedback we have had so far from traders has been positive, but it is still early days.”Another idea is to install electric vehicle charging bays near shops.Mr Jennings said: “Drivers of electric vehicles plan their routes around the availability of charging stations so this would enhance the offering in Ellon to encourage electric vehicle owners to visit Ellon as a destination of choice.“If fast-charging points were installed, a driver would know their vehicle would be fully charged in  minutes and would be happy to walk around the town centre in the meantime, contributing to local businesses.”Another idea seeks to draw passing tourists with designated parking bays for overnight stays in several locations around the town.The next step will be for Aberdeenshire Council to appoint an officer to lead the project.Mr Jennings said: “Once the council comes back to us, we will be looking for members of the community to come on board with the project team and take the plan

Douglas Lumsden said now the building warrant has been granted, the “intention” would be for that work to start “immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be

counts","story":"Selfless people from across the north-east are giving up their time to help patients caught up in medical emergencies.The volunteers are trained up as Scottish Ambulance Service community first responders to assist paramedics when emergency  calls are made.Teams have also been instrumental in helping with the rollout of defibrillators across the region, including Westhill, Newmachar and Bridge of Don.Prior medical training is not required for volunteers, as full training is provided so they can attend to patients on the street or in their homes.Donald Montgomery, community resilience co-ordinator, who looks after the team in Grampian, Angus and Shetland, said: “We’re pretty well covered up in Grampian, I’ve got a really great team. They’re a fantastic bunch.“Every month they have to do a training night, it’s not an option, but other than that they can sign up for as many hours of voluntary work as they want.“They’ll be trained in things like CPR, how to use a defibrillator, how to treat asthma, burns etc. They are allowed to use oxygen as well.”Once volunteers have been trained up, they have to go through a -question multiple choice exam, and are also observed attending to someone acting as a casualty before they can pass and become a first responder.Donald said: “Once they are trained up, they can call in and say they’re available say Monday from pm until midnight, andany calls come in they could be sent to them, as long as they’re within five minutes.“They could also be called and asked to go further afieldtheir help is needed.”Their assistance is helpful in a range of circumstances, such as cardiac arrests, where every minute counts, and the sooner someone arrives on the scene to administer CPR, the higher the chance of survival.Community first responders will also be sent out to people with breathing dficulties and to deal with medical problems such as asthma, diabetes and epilepsy.Despite their training, they do not attend road traffic accidents, any alcohol-related jobs, anything related to psychiatric issues, maternity calls or incidents involving a patient under the age of , although they are trained in paediatric care just in case.A new team in Turrf is in the process of being set up, which will help provide more coverage in the area.Several people have just completed their training and the process of looking for more volunteers will begin soon.Anyone who wishes to join a group, or set up their own, is asked to get in contact with Donald, who can help give them the right information and support them. They must live within five to seven miles of the area they plan to cover.Audrey Wood set up the Newmachar first responders group along with two others after getting in contact with the Scottish Ambulance Service around  years ago.She said: “We’ve probably got enough people working with us, but we’d never say no to someone who would be able to volunteer through the day when the rest of us are at work.“At this time of year we’d usually have been quite busy with falls, but we don’t cover that anymore. We’re kept busy, we’re on call every day.“It’s extremely fulfilling. I’ve been doing it since we first started it up  years ago. The ambulance service have been really supportive and we’ve been really well supported by the community.“Our motto is neighbours helping neighbours.“We set it up because we were made aware of theof time an ambulance can take from call to arrival time.“You never feel like you’re alone, the ambulance service is only a call away.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.28166593-240x180.jpg

the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Scotlandrsquos train operator, Abellio, has posted losses for a third consecutive year. Prior to Christmas, I made it clear in Holyrood that delays and cancellations on the Borders Railway were unacceptable and I questioned the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to terminate Abellio ScotRailrsquos contract early in .I believe the move will cause disruption to passengers and puts into question job security for current employees.

I completely agree, and I hope that investment in our railway isnrsquot halted as a result.More fuel to the fire came over Christmas, when it was revealed that Abellio ScotRail said it had ended the past financial year pound million in the red, owing pound million to its owner, the nationalised railway of the Netherlands. It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world.

Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

vision to convince voters across the nation that they are fighting the same battle, during a speech in Brexit-backing Dagenham, east London, moments after nominations closed to push her into the next round.She stressed on Monday that Labour cannot ldquosteady the ship or play it safe in recovering from the worst general election result since , or the party ldquowill die and we will deserve to.Ms Nandy, who is through to the next round of the leadership battle, referenced the so-called red wall of former Labour strongholds across the Midlands and the North as she stressed a need to speak to broad swathes of the nation.----ldquoThe stark truth is, the path back to power for Labour will never be built along the red wall, she said.ldquoThe path back to power for the Labour Party will be built right across that red bridge that stretches from our major metropolitan cities, through our suburbs and into our smaller towns and villages as well.The former shadow cabinet member rejected the argument that Labour is locked in ldquoa tug of war and must choose between working and middle class, Leave and Remain, North and South or young and old.One of Labourrsquos most prominent critics of the partyrsquos pledge to hold another EU referendum, Ms Nandy also criticised the party for having ldquocompletely failed over Brexit and for allowing the Tories to ide the public.In Scotland, where

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

We now have an alternative royalty in the form of internet stars like the Kardashians, and Beyonce. This world has long held a fatal attraction to minor members of the royal brood, who aspire to the elite lestyle while lacking the means.Such has been the rather tawdry fate of Harry and Meghan. Megxit, and the disintegration of the Sussexesrsquo public image, would make a whole season of The Crown. Their departure from ldquosenior royal le has absolutely nothing to do with duty and everything to do with worldly aice.They clearly want to remain in the public eye, their celebrity wedding guest list confirmed that. They believe they can make a lot of money as influencers and sponsors. But they have found the duties and responsibilities of being part of the royal family uncongenial.In the words of Queen ndash the pop group that is ndash they want to break free. To which the British public says: fine. Do what you gotta to do. Polls show that the British public wish the Sussexes well in their new le.However, the deal is thatthey want to escape the paparazzi and the responsibilities of royalty, they must also give up its privileges. They must give up their royal titles and stop consuming vast amounts of public money.The renovation of their grace-and-favour home, Frogmore Cottage, cost the taxpayer pound. million. Their security costs around pound, a year. They receive millions from the revenues of royal estates, via Harryrsquos dad, Prince Charles.The financial taps should be turned off. There is no need, since Harryrsquos personal fortune is estimated at poundm and Meghan is also wealthy. To most of us this seems self-evident. And yoursquod expect Labour to be calling them out most loudly.The default position of the left used to be contempt for the flummery and waste of the royal family. They consume millions of pounds of public money that could be better used for foodbanks. The monarchy is regarded, rightly, as a feudal anachronism, the apex of privilege.But some Labour MPs, especially BAME ones, like Clive Lewis, seem to regard the Sussexes as a special kind of royalty. Far from condemning the behaviour of these soon-to-be ex-royals, theyrsquove been leaping to their defence. Meghan Markle is being portrayed as a victim rather than a social parasite. A victim of a racist media and a bigoted society.In a furious piece in the New York Times,columnist Afua Hirsch blamed deeply ingrained British racism for Meghanrsquos decision to ditch the Firm. ldquoHer treatment, she wrote, ldquohas proved what many of us have always known ... in this society racism will still follow you.Social media is fizzing with indignation at the allegedly racist treatment of Meghan. Oprah Winfrey has been fanning the flames across the pond. Racism has driven poor Meghan to seek refuge in Toronto.There is actually very little evidence of racism in the media treatment of Markle. The oft-quoted headline, ldquoshe was nearly straight out of Compton, may have been silly and wrong, but it wasnrsquot racist. The social and family background of a new member of the royal family is a legitimate matter of public interest.The instant sacking of disc jockey Danny Baker after his ldquomonkey tweet shows just how intolerant of racism the UK media has become. Criticism of Harry and Meghanrsquos hypocrisy in lecturing on the environment while relying on private jets is not racist.In the Sussexesrsquo resignation epistle there is no mention of racism. They clearly donrsquot like their treatment by the press. But their court actions against the media are about phone hacking and , not race.Meghan Markle was lionised by the press when she arrived on the scene three years ago. The media was fascinated and enchanted by this woke princess who was bringing the stuffy royal family into the st century.The coverage in all newspapers was little short of adulatory. Her feminism was widely praised she adorned the front page of Vogue her wedding had the full -inside-pages treatment.Meghanrsquos arrival was seen as a signicant moment in the progress towards equality and ersity in Britain. Her departure comes as a blow to minority groups which saw her as a torch-bearer for anti-racism and anti-sexism. As a royal she had a unique  now she is just another self-obsessed celebrity.And the royalsrsquo behaviour following the Epstein scandal is a serious blow to The Firm. It is clear that the monarchy, as it stands, is no longer viable. It will have to downsize to immunise itself from scandals like this in future.Questions about the anachronistic constitutional role of the Queen can no longer be avoided.She is head of state, a formal role of course, but one that nearly became highly political during the Brexit crisis last year. There was a real possibility that the Queen might have had to decide whether or not to endorse a caretaker prime minister.This monarch should be the last to have any formal role in the constitution. The Crown should no longer be seen as above politics. The hereditary principle should play no part in our democracy.It goes without saying that therersquos no place for royalty in Scotland. The Scottish National Party needs to reassess its historical support for the Queen. Alex Salmond called her the ldquoQueen of Scots, and the  White Paper envisaged a role for the monarch in Scotland after independence. This is surely no longer tenable.If Scotland is to become independent, there should be no question of a hereditary head of state. And there is surely no place for celebrity airheads like the Sussexes."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-author-comes-cold-accept-honour","story":"Olof Palme The Olof Palme award is named for the Swedish politician and statesman who was assassinated in  - the killer has never been found.

Itrsquos as wild as ever!As it happened, Marr had a guest who was in every sense a genuine box office draw.The BBCrsquos Sunday show is meant to be the television equivalent of a Sunday newspaper, with lighter material balancing the heavier political fare.Previous arts guests have included the director Sam Mendes, talking about his movie , Scots actor Brian Cox, the musician James Blunt, and the saxophonist Jess Gillam.The arts filling in the politics sandwich yesterday was one James McAvoy. The Glasgow-born actor is earning toasty reviews for his performance as Cyrano de Bergerac at the Playhouse Theatre in London. Directed by Jamie Lloyd and adapted by Martin Crimp, it is a stripped-back version of Rostandrsquos nineteenth century play. It is so back to basics there is no set, no period costumes, no props, and controversially, no large nose for Cyrano.McAvoy was fine with that. Itrsquos not about the nose, he insisted. ldquoIt is described as being hideous, ugly, all these things. It never is. Itrsquos usually a bit bulbous, itrsquos maybe a bit long, but I think there is always somebody out there who would fancy a bit of that.Now, you might think being on a politics show would involve talking about current affairs. It depends on the guest, however. Some are comfortable talking about politics, others steer clear.Anyone tuning in yesterday to hear McAvoyrsquos hot take on indyref,indeed he even has one, would have been disappointed. Perhaps Marr chose not to ask, or McAvoy did not say anything of note. Either way, the subject failed to make an appearance.The liveliest moment came when Marr brought up Martin Scorsesersquos comments about superhero movies. The director of Raging Bull and The Irishman put the CGI cat among the pigeons recently when he said special effects- laden superhero movies were not proper cinema because there was no genuine jeopardy.He told Empire magazine: ldquoHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isnrsquot the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.Among McAvoyrsquos most famous roles is Charles Xavier in the X-Men movies. His reaction to Scorsesersquos comments ldquoHersquos Martin Scorsese, he can say what he likes. But I would also hope that hersquos watched every single superhero movie. Irsquove watched some of them and they are dross, and Irsquove watched some of them that have moved me to tears, made me really feel and think. Some of them have terried me and scared me in ways that his [Scorsesersquos] movies have never done.With that it was back to the studio and politics as usual. Even here there was an attempt to inject some drama into proceedings. Marrrsquos final guest was Emily Thornberry, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, and one of those hoping to be the new Labour leader.By today, in common with the other candidates, Thornberry must have secured the backing of at least  MPs MEPs to proceed to the next round of the contest. By yesterday she was still short by more than half. Tick tock.Ms Thornberry said she was ldquofairly confident she would get enough votes. She put her slow start in the race down to the party being in a general state of ldquogrief after the disastrous showing in the General Election.Thus far, the Labour leadership contest has been a ldquoprolier than thou contest to see who has the strongest working class roots. In keeping with this, Marr asked Ms Thornberry about her now infamous  tweet in which she posted a picture of a white van outside a house that was draped with St Georgersquos flags. You appeared to be sneering, he said.I wasnt, said Thornberry. ldquoThe truth is I was brought up on a council estate, in a house that looks very similar to [that], my brother was a builder until he had an accident.

The fastest application to date still took  days.ldquoThis needs to be looked at.Despite creating the legislation which gave rise to it, the Scottish Government said the Tribunal was an independent independent judicial body and the Lord President, as the head of the judiciary, was responsible for its operation.A spokesperson said: ldquoMinisters have taken signicant action to increase security and stability for those living in the private rented sector, including protection from unlawful eviction and wrongful terminations.ldquoWe recognise that rent arrears can be a serious concern for landlords and agree that landlords must be able to recover possession of their property when they follow the correct legal procedures for eviction.ldquoHowever, the Scottish Government considers it entirely appropriate that when seeking to evict someone from their home, this should be done following a fair judicial process."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-demand-fair-budget-snp","story":"In a campaign launched today, the council umbrella body Cosla warns more investment is needed in hard-pressed local services ldquobefore it is too late.It accuses SNP ministers of both skimping on their funding and burdening councils with nationally-directed duties.In , only  per cent of council spending was in lsquoprotected areasrsquo such as education and social work.Last year, more than % was in areas protected by central government, forcing councils to find savings in the other %.Cosla said that meant disproportionate cuts in roads, economic planning and culture and leisure.With another poundm ring-fenced in -, it said an extra poundbn of revenue and poundm of capital spending was vital.Cosla president Alison Evison said: ldquoIn recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out.ldquoIf we are to truly realise Scotlandrsquos potential then local authorities must receive a fair settlement.The Government said: ldquoThe failure of the UK Government to publish its budget at an earlier time means we do not have clarity on the funding available for our schools, hospitals and other vital public services.ldquoDespite this, we remain focused on introducing a Scottish budget for - at the earliest practical opportunity, and are in discussions with Cosla on how we can support their budget process.ldquoDespite further cuts to the Scottish Budget from the UK Government, we have ensured our partners in local government receive fair funding - delivering a funding package of pound.bn for all local authorities in  , which is a real terms increase of more than pound million.ldquoWhile ring-fenced funding is for increased investment in services such as our schools and nurseries, local authorities have complete autonomy to allocate over % - pound.bn - of the funding we provide, plus all locally raised income.ldquoDecisions on budget allocations for future years are subject to the outcome of the current negotiations with Cosla.ldquoThe results will be confirmed as part of the Budget in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"flights-delayed-plane-bursts-tyre-landing-glasgow-airport","story":"The \"technical issue\" left a runway blocked and forced at least one flight into a holding pattern.The airport fire service attended the plane and passengers disembarked once it was safe to do so.: Megxit means Megxit - its time to abolish the monarchyA spokesman for the airport said the runway has now been cleared.He added: \"An easyJet aircraft arriving from Malaga suffered a technical issue on landing.

It is  miles from Scotgoldrsquos site at Cononish near Tyndrum which is preparing to begin full-scale mining operations at what will be Scotlandrsquos first commercial gold mine.Earlier this year Scotgold also revealed soil samples from the hills of Glen Fyne close to the village of Cairndow had revealed ldquoexciting, new and potentially signicant results, with gold showing signs of being three times better than anticipated, and the silver almost twice as good.That area, which is said to be around two miles long, has been placed as a ldquohigh priority for further sampling with a view to eventually extracting the gold and silver reserves.The mine at Cononish produced gold for the first time in August  following the launch of an ore processing trial. Scotgold Resources has plans to re-open an old mine shaft and extract more than half a million tonnes of mineral ore, along with up to , tonnes of rock.Work will see a m tunnel dug as part of the initial exploration of the area expanded to stretch  metres deep into the hillside. The mine will then spiral m back up towards the surface.Itrsquos expected the mine will produce around , ounces of gold throughout its letime which, at current gold prices of pound an ounce, would place its value at over pound million. However, the actual value could be even higher once a premium is added for its rarity value.News of gold-digging operations has inspired a mini lsquogold rushrsquo among iniduals seeking glittering treasure in rivers and burns. Meanwhile earlier this month it emerged that a -carat doughnut-shaped nugget said to be worth pound, was found in a Scottish river in May.The gold, which weighs a total of .g, was found in an undisclosed river by a er using a method known as ldquosniping, using a snorkel and hand tools to scour the riverbed.The find came a year after the discovery of an .g nugget valued at pound,.

He is an agile politician and performs well at First Ministerrsquos Questions. He is tribal on the issue of independence but takes a more collaborative approach when it matters. His handling of the vaginal mesh scandal was impressive and when he became visibly emotional while raising the plight of the affected women, he looked sincere.Michelle Ballantyne is the partyrsquos social security spokeswoman at Holyrood and entered the race to ensure that members have a proper contest and not a \"coronation\" of odds-on favourite Jackson Carlaw.

something that ultimately comes down to politics.They write: ldquoIf a second independence referendum is to take place and be effective as a means of achieving independence it is therefore crucial that it be conducted on a proper legal footing ndash that is, that the rules it sets out providing for the organisation of a poll and regulating the conduct of the referendum campaign are legally valid and hence binding on those to whom they apply.ldquoAttempting to proceed with a referendum without such a legislative underpinning would be a non-starter, given that it would depend upon the co-operation of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities in organising the vote , and would almost certainly be boycotted by unionists.ldquoAny attempt to legislate for a referendum [at Holyrood] without a further explicit transfer of power is certain to be challenged in the courts could cause signicant dficulties within the Scottish Government, possibly including resignation of the Scottish Law Officers and might also provoke retaliatory legislation from Westminster to make clear that such legislation is not within Holyroodrsquos competence.ldquoMoreover, evensuch a Bill were to survive, a unilateral approach to authorising a second referendum might again lead to a unionist boycott and could not be certain of co-operation from the UK Government in implementing a vote for independence.The UK Government has so far refused to grant a Section  order for Indyref.Although SNP Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has hinted at a possible legal challenge to obtain a Section  order, the authors say it is ldquoextremely unlikely that such a challenge would be successful, since there is no duty to make a section  Order, still less to introduce primary legislation.The academics also say Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate carries no legal weight.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos mandate to hold a referendum ndash though politically important ndash seems legally irrelevant.ldquoThe doctrine of the mandate plays, at best, a marginal role in UK constitutional law and practice, and in any case what constitutes a mandate is highly ambiguous: how clear does a manesto promise have to be is a majority of seats or of votes requiredand which elections are relevant ndash to the UK Parliament, which holds the legal competence to dissolve the Union, or the Scottish Parliament, from which the Scottish Governmentrsquos authority derives They also say judicial review challenges against the UKrsquos refusal - for example on grounds of irrationality or the  precedent - also ldquoseem likely to fail.Some senior SNP figures, including MP Angus Brendan MacNeil, have suggested a lsquoPlan Brsquo in the face of the UKrsquos refusal, arguing a SNP election win could trigger independence talks.However Prof McHarg and Mr McCorkindale say this is also unlikely to work, as it does not overcome ldquothe power dynamics behind the referendum dilemma, as it would still require an unwilling UK government to take part in those independence talks.Turning to what the Scottish Government might do, the pair say it is likely Ms Sturgeon has anticipated her plan for Indyref in late  would be rejected, and that refusal would become the centre-piece of the SNPrsquos campaign in the  Holyrood election.In a similar vein, they said SNP MPs could introduce a Private Memberrsquos Bill at Westminster for the transfer of referendum powers to Holyrood in order to ldquosignal action to an impatient audience and ldquoemphasise the sites of political obstruction when the Bill falls.The SNP could also use push the issue relentlessly at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, work with the Greens at Holyrood to withhold legislative consent for Westminster legislation, and encourage pressure through street protests and by getting the backing of civic Scotland.But in the end, the most credible and effective route to independence was a political deal.They concluded: ldquoWhether there is a second referendum ndash andso, on what terms ndash is a political question that will be resolved in the political arena. There are no legal short cuts through that space.ldquoA referendum that has a clear legal basis, agreed to between governments, that is regulated by law and consistent with democratic and rule of law values is the surest - perhaps the only - way to deliver a result that is fair, decisive, and accepted as legitimate at home and abroad.Tory MSP Adam Tomkins, his partysconstitution spokesman, said: \"The SNPrsquos tactics to campaign for separation are once again shown to be utterly futile.ldquoThe law on this is very clear the constitution is a reserved issue.ldquoThe people of Scotland voted no to independence in  and that has not changed.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: \"The  Edinburgh Agreement ensured that there was a legal, fair and decisive vote on independence.\"The nationalists lost, yet they have spent the subsequent years desperate to stack the decks in their favour and have another go.ldquoRather than throwing their toys out of the plan, the SNP should be working with others to deliver a federal UK and ensure that power is shared across the whole of the UK.An SNP spokesperson said: \"This is about democracy, pure and simple.\"There is an explicit and resounding democratic mandate to hold an independence referendum -greater than the mandate Boris Johnson claims to impose Brexit.\"It would be entirely undemocratic for the UK government to try and continue to block a referendum ndash that is a position which cannot, and will not, prevail.\""},{"url":null,"title":"queen-hails-very-constructive-discussions-future-prince-harry-meghan-markle","story":"The head of state announced there would be a ldquoperiod of transition with Harry and Meghan ndash who have said they want to be financially independent and step back as senior royals ndash living in Canada and the UK.:Prince Harry and Prince William slam lsquooffensive and potentially harmfulrsquo newspaper storyShe stressed the discussions were ldquocomplex matters for her family to resolve but she wanted ldquofinal decisions in the ldquocoming days.A statement from Buckingham Palace read: ldquoToday my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family.ldquoMy family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghanrsquos desire to create a new le as a young family.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But even before the election was called, Ms Ballantyne was getting around association meetings to raise her profile beyond the Borders in anticipation of a contest sooner or later. Her strong promise to the grassroots of more say to local associations has attracted plenty of support, including some of my Edinburgh Council colleagues, so a good contest is pretty much guaranteed.: The Conservatives have abandoned true conservatism for nationalism – Paris Gourtsoyannis: Alister Jack said he would fund breakaway Scottish Conservative PartyOf course, it’s all very well winning the contest, it’s what happens afterwards that matters and there is a very small window for the winner to settle in and produce a strategy that gives the party a realistic chance of overtaking the SNP as the biggest single party at the  Scottish elections. By the time the result is announced on February , there will be barely  months to go so realistically around seven months to prepare and agree a campaign.That process has been complicated by this week’s departure of strategy and communications chief Eddie Barnes, who planned to go shortly after Ruth Davidson’s decision to step down but agreed to stay on for the election campaign. The gap he leaves is not the only one from Ruth Davidson’s  high-point, with the previous departures of policy chief Marek Zemanic and the closest the Scottish Conservatives had to the left-field thinking power of Dominic Cummings, Kevin Ancell. So the new leader’s top priority is to assemble his or her version of that team, able to work effectively with whatever comes out of Mr Cummings’ Downing Street “weirdos and misfits” shake-up. Scottish party director Lord Mark McInnes and chairman Rab Forman have vital roles to play and both understand the political reality that the minute the contest is over the focus must be on the wider electorate, not party structures. Partly for this reason, it was accepted that turning Ruth Davidson’s succession into an argument about the Scottish party’s relationship with London would be disastrous. The membership is certainly anxious to be talking about new Conservative policies for the  campaign, an attractive, viable alternative programme for government, and for the  campaign not to rely solely on opposition to a second independence referendum.But the key lesson from the  triumph was the simplicity of the message and that campaign had learnt from the  disaster what look like detailed, credible and honest policies on paper can easily become electoral poison.There is more than enough in the SNP’s  years of government to attack without giving Nationalists the means to deflect criticism.We know from the  campaign in Scotland that those Conservatives who turned away did so because they didn’t like Boris Johnson or Brexit or both, but in a dferent context would . The context in  will indeed be dferent Brexit will be done and, like it or not, the election will be about a second independence referendum first and foremost, then the SNP’s record.Cynical though it may seem, details of what the new leader would like to dohe or she is First Minister come after understanding what it will take to win. And sticking to it.Downing Street’s pointless fight with Scottish PressAt a time of unprecedented political change and the perpetual turmoil of the digital communications revolution, the desire of the new UK Government to “slaughter sacred cows” is recognition that so many of the old ways of doing things are no longer suitable. In looking for places to start, Downing Street has chosen what it probably regarded as a soft target by switching the twice-daily official briefings for the Westminster Lobby correspondents from their offices above the Commons to  Downing Street.It’s not dficult to see why this wasn’t thought to be much of a problem because the list of registered Lobby journalists is dominated by heavy representation from the big news organisations  from the BBC alone,  from the , The Sun eight and even the weekly Spectator magazine lists three.Beyond Fleet Street, the Scottish Press is the best-represented group, with staff from this paper, the Herald, Daily Record, The Courier and the Aberdeen Press  Journal, but with only the one from each they will have to dash from the Commons to Downing Street, get through the security gate and into Number  and then the same in reverse to catch whatever business is going on in the House.It’s a needless inconvenience and a reasonable compromise of having the morning brief in Downing Street but the afternoon session kept in the Lobby has been mooted. With the Scottish election looming and a new Scottish leader to bed in, whatever holy cattle are headed for the abattoir, Downing Street shouldn’t pick pointless fights with the Scottish Press.Free trade or holidays Much of Scotland’s global reputation for being lovers of hard drink is based not just on the whisky business but on the bacchanalian revelry which surrounds Hogmanay, to the extent that two bank holidays are needed for the hangover while the rest of the UK gets by with one.But for the newspaper business, January  is a normal publishing day, bringing readers news of the celebrations, the New Year babies, previews of sports fixtures and such like and in the internet age that won’t change.But now it seems First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is set to back a campaign by the shop workers union Usdaw to ban bigger shops from opening on Ne’er Day which would all but wipe out hard copy sales which remain vital to an industry already under severe financial pressures.Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says it’s to allow retail staff to spend more time with their families, but it’s just another excuse for government to interfere with free trade.John McLellan is a Conservative councillor in Edinburgh©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen issues supportive statement agreeing to transition plan for harry and meghan","story":"The head of state announced there would be a \"period of transition\" with Harry and Meghan -

eventhe SNP was ed to power at next years Scottish parliamentary elections with a majority. The Tory minister said Boris Johnson would reply to a letter from Nicola Sturgeon requesting a Section  order \"very soon\", but suggested such a request would be rejected out of hand.The First Minister has insisted her partys mandate to call a second referendum was strengthened by last months general election result.Referring to the result of the  independence vote, which the UK Government insists must be respected, Mr Jack said: \"Its about once in a generation and once in a letime, thats what people voted for.\": Jack rules out indyref evenSNP win  Holyrood majorityBut Mr Russell responded today: \"The UK’s bogus argument was exposed by the hapless Scottish Secretary yesterday when he got generations mixed up with letimes and sounded ridiculous.\"Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, suggested the Prime Minister knew, in his heart of hearts, that blanket opposition to an IndyRef would ultimately prove to be unsustainable. \"This dam will be burst,\" he told The Herald.He continued: \"We will make sure we are building the case both for Scotland to be independent and for the right to have that independence referendum at home and abroad. So we are simply not going to let this go.\"Speaking to the BBC yesterday, Mr Jack said his letter to the Prime Minister advises against allowing a second referendum on independence.The SNP won a landslide victory in the election north of the border last month, but the minister said support for pro-union parties versus pro-independence parties had not actually changed from the  referendum when % of Scots voted to stay in the UK and % to leave.\"A referendum is about a straight result, its not about first past the post system,\" he said. \"I still equate it to the number of people voting for Unionist parties and I dont think that that number has changed over the last five years.\"He added: \"Weve had  years where Scotland has been in discussion or having referendums.

Scotlands biggest city is no stranger to marches or demonstrations, but the scale of them has increased greatly in the years since the  referendum.All Under One Bannermay have started off as a fringe organisation but it now finds itself a familiar part of the Scottish political landscape. The non-party group plans to stage eight pro-independence marches across towns and cities north of the Border in  alone.Its first event of the year saw tens of thousands of participants shrug off some dismal January weather to march from Kelvingrove Park to Glasgow Green.As usual with the AUOB marches, the event was well-behaved and family friendly. People of all ages demonstrated their democratic right to freely assemble in support of a political cause they passionately believe in - in this case, the demand to stage an IndyRef.The right to march is a cornerstone of UK democracy - but few campaign groups have ever tried to stage so many large-scale events on such a regular basis.Smile for the camerasThe marches are a useful tool for the pro-independence campaign as they offer a visual shorthand of popular support. Newspapers and websites around the world regularly illustrate stories on the continuing Scottish independence debate with a picture taken at one of AUOBs events.Fringe nationalists used to argue on social media that pro-independence marches were being deliberately ignored by national broadcasters and newspapers. Yet reporters were out in force at Saturdays event - not to mention numerous press photographers and camera crews. Supporters of Scotlands place in the Union tend to dismiss such marches as irrelevant. Walking several miles in the pouring rain counts for nothing come polling day.But in the aftermath of last months general election - which saw the SNP sweep the board for a second time in five years - Saturdays procession goes someway to illustrate the seemingly boundless enthusiasm that exists among pro-independence activists. These are folk who are ready to chap doors and hand out leafletsan IndyRef is ever called.The company you keepSeveral senior Nationalists were happy to take part in Saturdays march and share pictures on their social media. Nicola Sturgeon didnt attend - but did send a good luck message before it got underway. AUOB is not affiliated with the SNP and its events are organised with no input from the party. Its an arrangement that suits both sides.The SNP is happy to keep such marches at arms . Scottish independence is a genuine cross-party campaign - but everyone knows that one party in particular dominates, given its resources and number of MSPs and MPs. Supporting grass roots independence events shows the SNP is willing to allow others to join in. But it also allows the Nationalists the chance to distance the party from elements it doesnt like.It was telling that none of the elected representatives who were happy to be pictured taking part in Saturdays march turned up for the brief AUOB press conference held after the event.Among the speakers was former Scottish Socialist Party leader - and convicted perjurer - Tommy Sheridan. There are some in the SNP who would flatly refuse to ever share a stage with Mr Sheridan, given his political baggage. Also speaking was former UK ambassador Craig Murray, who was blocked by SNP bosses from standing as a candidate in the  general election - despite winning approval of local members in Airdrie. That decision prompted Mr Murray to write on his blog in : “Those in the SNP who make a fat living out of it are terried the energy of the Yes campaign may come to threaten their comfy position.”PlacardsAUOB is at pains to point out it is an umbrella organisation. It claims to welcome all supporters of independence - regardless of political affiliation. But some Unionists were distinctly uncomfortable at some of the messages on display at Saturdays event.One large placard - a picture of which was shared widely on social media - proclaimed \"F*** Off You Tory C****\". The banner in question carried the logo of Class War - a loose collective of anarchists that achieved notoriety in the early s. Its unlikely that SNP strategists would welcome them into a formal IndyRef campaign.The Socialist Workers Partywas also in attendance. It has a habit of turning up at any large-scale outdoor political rally. Its members were kept busy handing out some strongly-worded placards - one of which demanded \"Break Up the British State\" - to unsuspecting marchers. Thomas Kerr, a Conservative councillor on Glasgow City Council, hit out at the anti-Tory \"hatred\" he received following Saturdays march.Mr Kerr, who was first elected in , questioned what he called another \"fingers in ears\" moment for the SNP leadership after receiving a barrage of abuse online.Going forwardAUOB will be more than satisfied with how Saturdays march panned out in terms of participation and media coverage. Yet the question remains: do such events actually increase support for independence Recent polling shows support for a Yes vote has crept above the  per cent achieved in . But it is the No side that has consistently held a lead in the polls in the past five years, even after Brexit.The dilemma facing pro-independence supporters remains much the same in  as it was in .

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Flag-graphic1.jpg","title":"oidhche challain no admission without a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is a pitch-black night in a west coast village  years ago, the night of the  January: New Year according to the Julian calendar still followed by older people in the community, even though it was superseded by the more accurate Gregorian calendar a century ago.Suddenly the silence is broken by a cacophony of shouting boys, and the pandemonium is taken up by dogs barking all over the village. depending on where you are – has begun.Gangs of boys in masks and white clothes roam from house to house.

Two other swimmers making their yearly pilgrimage were Arthur Chatfield from Scotland and Alan Traynor from Donegal.Several families also participated and among them were, the Eddie and Scott Gilmore, Simon and Chole Murphy, Darren and Curtis Donnell, Alister and Laurie Neeson, Anthony and Paul O’Rawe, Brian Lemon and Son Brian, Robert, Matthew, Sarah and Joy Bowman, Andrew and William Knox and David and Naomi Morrow. With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past. Last year the swim raised the magnicent sum of pound and this year again has got off to a brilliant start with pound being lted on the day thanks to the generous sponsorship from the general public. The social festivities got off to a good start with Bert Kernohan carrying out the duties of compere and the music being supplied by Two Star Country. The Choir Challenge followed with the ladies out to regain their crown which they had lost last year. They went first conducted by Dana Kernohan setting a very high standard for the judge Billy McIlroy. The men followed and put on a wonderful performance under the leadership of Bert Kernohan.In judging Billy said he had to apply the “Var” as used in football and on this the better harmonising by the ladies gave them the win by the slimmest of margins which was received with rapturous applause.Next year will be the th anniversary of the event which will be a Major Milestone in its history.The Chairman thanked everyone who in any way assisted in helping to make the event the success that it was.The swim took place under the watchful eye of Larne Branch St Johns Ambulance, East Antrim R.N.L.I., Kayakers Jim Mulvenna, Marion O’Dornan and her sister Claire Corr.

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision.

His decision to enter politics in  was sparked by his involvement in grassroots campaign: No Doctor No Village.The campaign was founded in response to the “crisis in rural general practice resulting from government neglect of the rural healthcare system”, as general practice continues to struggle with recruitment, especially in rural areas of Ireland.It is now not possible to fulfil both commitments. I have had to make a choice between seeking re-election or keeping my promise to my local community.

I have had to make a choice between seeking re-election or keeping my promise to my local community. I have chosen the latter.“I hope the imminent election campaign will be fair and robust, allowing all candidates to put forwards their ideas and policies clearly so that the people can make an informed choice.”Dr Harty is currently chairman of the Joint Oireacthas Health Committee and last year voted against Health Minister Simon Harris in a motion of no-confidence over the spiralling costs of the National Children’s Hospital.Dr Harty’s resignation opens up a seat in the Clare constituency, which currently has one Fianna Fail, and two Fine Gael TDs."},{"url":null,"title":"sandringham talks what issues are up for discussion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

are likely to be discussed at Sandringham..push– FundingThis is one of the most contentious issues.Harry and Meghan want to be financially independent and earn their own money, but still say they will be supporting the Queen in their duties.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in February  The Prince of Wales currently pays for most of their official duties and some of their private costs through his £ million a year Duchy of Cornwall income, but will this continue Taxpayers foot the bill for official travel through the Sovereign Grant, but will the taxpayer have to pay as Harry and Meghan travel to and from North America as they carry out private work to earn their own income.Will the taxpayer still pay for travel on official tours,there are any – SecurityThe Sussexes’ website indicates British taxpayers will still have to cover the cost of their police protection officers.But only senior royals tend to get police protection, so should the public still have to pay for Harry and Meghan’s police guards \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Prince of Wales, the Queen, the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge will meet on Monday The Duke of York now pays for Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie’s security after facing many years of criticism because they were not working royals.Frequent travel between North America and the UK will also require additional security, and will the British taxpayers have to pay for Archie’s security as well as he grows up What will the cost be of guarding Frogmore Cottage when it stands empty, and the same for a property abroad Will the Canadians or the US,they move there, have to contribute to the security costs  How will this be split How will Harry, Meghan and Archie’s security be ensuredthey do not use highly trained police protection officers, and drivers – Official dutiesThe prospect of dual roles as royals who earn private money is fraught with problems.Royal financial expert David McClure described it as a “toxic mix”.Harry and Meghan say they want “to carve out a progressive new role within this institution”.But they have been accused of going rogue and trying to rip up the royal book which has evolved over hundreds of years.Questions that need answers include:– What official engagements will Harry and Meghan carry out and how many – What proportion of their time will be spent on royal duties, and what will happen to their Commonwealth roles, their charities and their patronages – How will they ensure there is not a conflict of interest between their royal duties and their private work – Cashing in on royal statusOne of the major problems for royals earning their own money is being accused of cashing in on royal status.The Countess of Wessex and Sarah, Duchess of York faced such problems, with Sophie in the end quitting her PR business to become a full-time royal instead.Royal aides will have to look at how to avoid Harry and Meghan being accused of profiting financially from their royal connections.– Homes in relation to Frogmore House on the Windsor Estate \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Frogmore Cottagein relation to Frogmore House on the Windsor Estate The duke and duchess plan to split their time between the UK and North America – presumably Canada, or Calornia where Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lives – but how will their transatlantic lestyle work Their website says they will continue to live at Frogmore Cottage.But presumably the Queen, who gave permission for the couple to use the home as their official residence, will still agree to this.They will also need a base in North America, but who will pay for this property Will taxpayers have to refurbish this home because Harry and Meghan are still members of the royal family, or will they pay for it themselves Frogmore Cottage was also renovated at a cost of £. million by the taxpayer, with more costs likely to be published in the royal accounts this summer.Royal aides could even face calls from the taxpayers for Harry and Meghan to repay this money.When Windsor Castle caught fire in , public opinion had turned against the royals amid fears that taxpayers would have to foot the bill for the castle’s repairs.In the end, the Queen agreed to pay % of the £. million costs by opening Buckingham Palace to the public for the first time to generate extra income.It was also announced that she would pay income tax for the first time and cut down the size of the Civil List.– Work\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex leaving after their visit to Canada House Royal aides will want to know what sort of private work Harry and Meghan are considering and whether it will be beyond reproach, with the reputation of the royal family at stake.Ato acting for former Suits star Meghan, who quit ahead of her wedding, is thought unlikely, but nothing seems off the table at the moment.Harry and Meghan are planning to launch their Sussex Royal Foundation with a global reach.Who will pay for this and do they plan to earn money from this charitable venture and,so, how will this be justied Could the couple be considering earning an income from television work, motivational lectures, or autobiographical or children’s books Meghan ran her own lestyle blog before marrying into the royals so could be thinking of bringing back the thetig.Harry is a former soldier, but has no fallback profession and has not worked in private employment.– CitizenshipWhat will happen with Meghan’s citizenship, and Archie’s, and does Harry have the right to work in the US or Canada, or stay there long term At the time of their engagement, Kensington Palace said Meghan would be applying for British citizenship, but it was not known whether she would hold dual American citizenship.Questions will also arise as to where the couple will pay tax on their income, and how their finances will be scrutinised.– Carbon footprintHarry and Meghan faced criticism for their use of private jets over the summer, but their transatlantic travel could again raise issues about their carbon footprint."},{"url":null,"title":"the queens statement in

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown, the Moderator of the Derry and Donegal Presbytery, Rev Colin McKibbin, and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev’d Richard Johnston, also took part.The Lord Lieutenant of the City of Londonderry, Dr Angela Garvey, Deputy Lieutenant Mrs Stella Burnside , former Lord Lieutenant for the County, Sir Denis Desmond, the Duke of Abercorn and the Deputy Mayor, Cllr Cara Hunter, were in the congregation. Also present were Lord Hay of Ballyore, Dame Mary Peters, former PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell, Sinn Feacutein MEP Martina Anderson, former SDLP leader Mark Durkan, Mrs Pat Hume, former Church of Ireland Primate Most Rev’d Alan Harper and the Bishop of Mahajanga in Madagascar, Rt Rev’d Hall Speers. The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Rev’d Richard Clarke, was unable to attend in person and Bishop Andrew Forster read out a tribute from Dr Clarke in which he described Bishop Mehaffey as “a powerful influence for good”. “Of course, we all have our own inidual memories of Jim,” the Archbishop said, “but all of us will recall with particular admiration his work – in company with Bishop Edward Daly – not only for peace but also for reconciliation in this city. “Together they brought hope and light into communities where there was precious little of either. We all saw in Bishop Jim a gracious composure coupled with a steely resolve – the sense that this work for peace and harmony between communities so long ided was work for the Kingdom of God, and it would not be thwarted, from whatever quarter.” googletag.cmd.push HallmarkThe address in the Service was delivered by the Rt Rev’d The Lord Eames, another former Primate of the Church of Ireland, who recalled Dr Mehaffey’s advice to colleagues on the Church of Ireland’s Priorities Committee to remember why they were there. “If there is a hallmark as he moved to this city to be your Bishop,” Lord Eames said, “ there is a hallmark that I would have as part of his legacy, it is those words: ‘Hold on, you’ve lost sight of why we’re here.’ You’ve lost sight that the reconciliation in our community which was so fostered by Edward Daly and James Mehaffey must never be lost sight of. “You’ve lost sight of the wonderful rewards of reconciliation or in reaching out hands of friendship. And within the Church, you’ve lost sight at times of your roots – the roots that have given you the commission of God to be alive for all sorts and conditions of people.“For Bishop Jim, this was his priority as he worked with Edward and other leaders to bind up the broken, to heal the wounds of the lost, to make people remember why you’re here, that in the short gt of a lespan you must grasp every opportunity to do things for the good of all – across the barriers, across the river and across the isions.“This was his ministry as a Bishop. It was a ministry exercised in those dark days of suffering, misunderstanding, suspicion and it was a ministry which was being true to the commission given to him in September : ‘Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring again the outcasts, seek the lost.’”Before the Service, Bishop Mehaffey’s we, Thelma, their daughter Wendy and son Tim welcomed the many hundreds of people from across the community who had come to sympathise with the family in their loss. And Wendy read out an emotional tribute to her father, during which she spoke of her love and gratitude to her “beautul dad”.She said her father’s love of people came into its own after he was appointed Bishop, as he sought friendships across the city. There was challenge in this role, Wendy said, but he remained steadfast in his belief and faith. “During his last spell in hospital,” she said, “there was a day when, in a moment of brilliant and characteristic clarity, Dad said: ‘One helps the other.’ May that be the profound message that we each take away from our gathering today.”Bishop Mehaffey’s remains will repose in St Columb’s Cathedral until Monday morning when they will be taken to Belfast for cremation. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

Philip ODoherty has increased the managers budget signicantly, by %, ahead of this season, and the manager admitted his delight at having that extra support ahead of what he and the fans hope will be a successful season. “The budget is key, absolutely, but at the same time Shamrock Rovers probably had one of the biggest budgets in the league last year, they won the FAI Cup and they continue to get better.“Of course, as a manager, you want a few extra pound to spend but we’ve got to strive both on and off the pitch to get this place better.“When you have the backing of a chairman who loves the place, that’s key to the whole process. In my opinion there wouldn’t be a Derry City Football Club without Philip O’Doherty because of his business sense and his investment over the years has been invaluable.“He rescued the club when it went out of business. He’s not just a guy who is throwing money at the football club, he’s a man who cares for the city. He cares for the people in the city. He’s a very proud Derry man andwe all took a leaf out of Philip O’Doherty’s book we’d be in a very good place.“He cares and backs it up. He invests in people and structures and employs a lot of people in the city. I, for one, hold him in the highest esteem for what he does for the people of Derry and for the football club. It should never be taken for granted.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue.

This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl claims its proposal will create an additional  jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.Permission has also been granted to a number of people to address todayrsquos Planning Committee meeting.Due to address councillors are planning consultant, Andy Stephens, who is objecting to the proposal, while Seamus McMullan Architects have requested to address politicians on behalf of Dr M Rooney who is also opposed to the Lidl proposal.Further speaking rights requests have been received from Conleth Rooney BL on behalf of Don Holdings Ltd, objecting to the application, with Lidlrsquos Norther Ireland Regional Director Conor Boyle and Nicholas McCrickard from the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, also due to address committee members.The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos meeting, planners reaffirm that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.The store argues the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found. Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes.

It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves.

I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

MP outlined her vision to convince voters across the nation that they are fighting the same battle, during a speech in Brexit-backing Dagenham, east London, moments after nominations closed to push her into the next round.She stressed on Monday that Labour cannot ldquosteady the ship or play it safe in recovering from the worst general election result since , or the party ldquowill die and we will deserve to.Ms Nandy, who is through to the next round of the leadership battle, referenced the so-called red wall of former Labour strongholds across the Midlands and the North as she stressed a need to speak to broad swathes of the nation. -- --ldquoThe stark truth is, the path back to power for Labour will never be built along the red wall, she said.ldquoThe path back to power for the Labour Party will be built right across that red bridge that stretches from our major metropolitan cities, through our suburbs and into our smaller towns and villages as well.The former shadow cabinet member rejected the argument that Labour is locked in ldquoa tug of war and must choose between working and middle class, Leave and Remain, North and South or young and old.One of Labourrsquos most prominent critics of the partyrsquos pledge to hold another EU referendum, Ms Nandy also criticised the party for having ldquocompletely failed over Brexit and for allowing the Tories to ide the public.In Scotland, where Labourrsquos support has been decimated by a rise in the SNP, Ms Nandy said an international commission was needed to defeat nationalism.ldquoNow is the time to look outwards, to think big and to paint on broad canvas, to set up an international commission to go out to the field and discover how in modern times, in just a few brief moments, the cause of social justice has beaten back isive nationalism and won, she said.She stressed the party has been able to listen to the public and to recover before, as she quoted former Labour PM Tony Blair.ldquoTough on crime, tough on the causes of crime ndash this was more than just a slogan, she said.I am so pleased to be back in Dagenham today to talk about rebuilding Labours red bridge ndash connecting our towns and cities from Dagenham to Fulham, Aberdeen to Glasgow and Cardf to Wrexham.Follow @teamnandy for updates.mdash Lisa NandyJanuary , They were right criminals were destroying communities, she said, but so too were those who were ldquodeeply troubled that it was people from ethnic minorities and poorer families who were most likely to be imprisoned.Acknowledging that allowed ldquoboth parts of Labourrsquos very erse coalition to find a solution, she added, pointing towards restorative justice and rehabilitation in conjunction with policing.Ms Nandy extended this analogy to kne crime in Croydon and drug running in Barrow, as being the ldquodferent symptoms of the same diseases, and to tackling the climate crisis.And she extended the comparison to those in Bassetlaw who fear their jobs are at risk and energy bills could go up, with Balham activistsrsquo talk of a green revolution, highlighting the need to build environmentally-friendly buses for the benefit of all.ldquoWe might be talking a dferent language but behind that we have exactly the same ambitions, she said, calling for a ldquoradical, reforming, credible Labour government that reunites with communities.She also praised the Dagenham women who in  fought for and won equal pay rights, with their strike in a nearby Ford factory.She rejected the belief that ldquochanging the man at the top would fix a crisis, saying leadership like theirs is needed now, and ldquoless the man who stands and pronounces at the despatch box at the House of Commons.Ms Nandy was among the five contenders through to the

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
