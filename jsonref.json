Go on a few viewings and you’re bound to discover that the living room you saw online is in fact just a sofa wedged awkwardly into one of the bedrooms.It’s hard to know what’s normal or what we can expect for what we can afford to pay.To make things a little clearer we launched What I Rent, a weekly series that takes you inside the homes of people renting in London.This week we’re having a nose around James’s one bedroom flat.James lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Crystal Palace. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Let’s chat money. How much are you paying each month?Never thought I’d pay four figures for rent. When I came to see the place I went thinking I wouldn’t take it, but once I stepped inside I was like, f*** it. It’s really decent and actually yeah, I would like a garden.And what about bills?About £150, I guess.Tell us about the location.The flat’s in Crystal Palace, about five mins walk from the best park in London.I can walk for about five minutes and look at a physical living farm animal which is absolutely mind-blowing, frankly. And of course there’s the dinosaurs.There’s a bloody decent Gipsy Hill pub practically next door called the Douglas Fir, the station is under 5 mins walk (and there’s no less than FIVE off-licences on that short way home, that’s like an off-licence per minute which is a really good number), up the hill there’s the Westow House pub which seems pretty lively, and the triangular high street that has a decent selection of shops and cracking views of London.There’s a bedroom, a living room and dining area, a kitchen, and a bathroom. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I think the other thing that hit me moving was how much more chilled out the south feels. I was in Stratford before which was flat, grey, and was kinda aggro.And how much greener it all is – I didn’t realise how much I liked trees until I was surrounded by them.I don’t think I’ll ever live north of the river again, and if I want to go there it’s p*ss easy to get to on the Overground*.I really don’t understand people that are so desperate to live in Zone 1 they pay £2k for a box room in Kensington or whatever. They are doing it wrong.*Until about midnight, in which case it’s buses from New Cross Gate or a train if you’re lucky.What’s the flat like?It’s a self-contained single bedroom flat, so just a bedroom, sitting room, one bathroom and kitchen.The bedroom’s not massive, but it does the job. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How long have you been there?It looks a bit spartan at the moment but I’m going to work on the garden and make it a cozy den with plants and lights and a barbecue, all that gaffDo you feel like you have enough space?Totally. The bedroom is a little cramped but I spend most of the time sitting in the garden or in the living room. Loads of storage in the kitchen.It’s not a huge place but it’s big enough. Be nice if the ceilings were a bit higher I guess, but I can’t really complain.How did you find it?First day of looking at places and saw some pretty awful ones (the view from one was a McDonald’s on a roundabout in a retail park in Charlton), then I had a look on OpenRent. Can’t recommend that site enough.I hear about everyone paying hundreds of pounds in fees and having to mess about with dodgy letting agents.I paid £20 in fees for a background check and the process of putting down a holding deposit was simple – I did it on my phone as soon as I left the viewing (you have to move so fast, the person viewing it before me was already talking money). Also I reckon the sort of landlord that’s going to use it is probably a bit more friendly and forward thinking – mine seems like a really nice bloke.James has only lived in the flat for a month, so is looking forward to make it more his own. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you like living alone?Well my girlfriend is here most of the time so it’s not like I’m lonely, but it’s nice having my own place again. Currently working on getting mates to travel all the way here on the regs but they seem quite happy to do this once they’ve sat in the park with a big bag of cans and realised how great it is.Is there anything you don’t like about where you live?It’s a bitch to get to once the Overground is done.We were at a rave in Hackney Marshes the other week and being on the bus for nearly two hours at 5AM when you’ve been dancing in a field for god know’s how long isn’t an experience I’d particularly recommend.What I Rent: Christie and Dom, £1,100 for a flat in LewishamI’m really happy here, I don’t think I’d want to live anywhere else in London really.When I move it’ll probably be to Berlin or Barcelona or somewhere like that.And… have you thought about buying a place?I’ve never seen that as something that was possible so I don’t waste time entertaining the thought.What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying. If you fancy taking part, please email whatirent@metro. You\u0027ll need to have pictures taken of your kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom, plus a few photos of you in your room. Make sure you get permission for your housemates!You\u0027ll also need to be okay with sharing how much you\u0027re paying for rent, as that\u0027s pretty important.

She’s clearly forgotten her roots and her family.‘There’s a whole different side to her that has started to surface and it’s ugly to see.‘I’ve read that Meg wants to be like Diana.

She’s not genuine like Diana.’ Markle Junior, a father-of-two who was last year arrested after a domestic incident with his fiancée, which saw him accused of drunkenly pulling a gun on her, has not spoken to Miss Markle for seven years but says he still would have expected an invitation to her wedding.He seizes on the fact that 600 guests have been invited to attend the wedding at St George’s Chapel in May 19, and a further 2,500 member of the public to watch proceedings from the Windsor Castle grounds.‘She’s forgotten her flesh and blood,’ he told the newspaper.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday, May 19, in WindsorFootage of people running away from knifeman in ParisFather recounts tearful memories of his two slain childrenFinal moments of Malaysia Airline MH370 to be revealed\u0027We\u0027ve got him!\u0027: Locals block road to help police catch \u0027burglar\u0027Injured co-pilot recovers after being \u0027sucked out of plane\u0027Shocking moment prison inmate chats to blogger live from his cellReal life \u0027Forrest Gump\u0027 proposes at finish line of 590 marathonsMoment heroic dog jumps into swimming pool to rescue canine palMeghan\u0027s father poses in paparazzi photos sold for up to £100kTown of Windsor gets ready for the upcoming Royal WeddingPassenger launches vicious attack on bus driver in Dublin  Harry and Meghan will stay at separate £1,500-a-night hotels before the wedding with the bride-to-be at former stately home linked to the Profumo affair and Prince in a 5-star owned by the Sultan of Brunei Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will spend the night before their wedding at separate luxury hotels close to Windsor Castle in rooms costing up to £1,500-a-night, it was revealed today.  Prince Harry will stay at the luxurious Coworth Park in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on Friday, which is owned by the Sultan of Brunei\u0027s Dorchester hotel group.The venue is a 15 minute drive from St George\u0027s Chapel and Prince William will also stay the night to support his brother, Kensington Palace has said, but is not known if Kate and their three children will also be there.The duke and prince play regularly on Coworth Park\u0027s world class polo grounds, which are managed by Guards Polo Club, and last year Meghan watched her then boyfriend play on the pitch. Meghan will stay at Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate, with her mother Doria, where rooms including the aptly named Prince of Wales suite can cost £1,500-a-night.Cliveden famously hosted the 1961 summer party where John Profumo would meet Christine Keeler and launch the affair that almost destroyed Harold Macmillan\u0027s Tory government. Its gardens still has the same outdoor pool where Christine was sunbathing when the Secretary of State for War first saw her - and it is still known as \u0027The Profumo Pool\u0027.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead            The Royal Kitchen at Windsor Castle has begun preparations for the wedding banquet    Pictured the Royal Palaces Head chef Mark Flanagan (right) and the Royal Palaces Pastry chef Selwyn Stoby (left)Still, Harry and Meghan hope that it will make the occasion less fussy and allow them to move around the room greeting as many guests as possible.Guests will also feast on canapes during the lunchtime reception, which will last around two and a half hours and includes speeches and cutting of the cake. Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Footage of people running away from knifeman in ParisFather recounts tearful memories of his two slain childrenFinal moments of Malaysia Airline MH370 to be revealed\u0027We\u0027ve got him!\u0027: Locals block road to help police catch \u0027burglar\u0027Injured co-pilot recovers after being \u0027sucked out of plane\u0027Shocking moment prison inmate chats to blogger live from his cellReal life \u0027Forrest Gump\u0027 proposes at finish line of 590 marathonsMoment heroic dog jumps into swimming pool to rescue canine palMeghan\u0027s father poses in paparazzi photos sold for up to £100kTown of Windsor gets ready for the upcoming Royal WeddingPassenger launches vicious attack on bus driver in Dublin"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/10/4C2A21B100000578-0-image-m-16_1526202287952.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan stay separate Windsor hotels night wedding","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on May 19 in Windsor but will stay apart on the night before  Prince Harry will stay at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park (pictured) in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on Friday, which is owned by the Sultan of Brunei  Harry and his brother will enjoy sumptuously furnished bedrooms like this on the night before walking down the aisle  Meghan will stay at Cliveden House Hotel (pictured), on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate, with her mother Doria.

Which presumably he would regard as a happy outcome. We mustn’t upset Brussels, after all.Many listeners would have concluded that a man who gives up his seat in Parliament and takes a huge salary abroad has no right to pontificate on our political future. Will voters really welcome him back to the country he abandoned?They will point to the irony in Miliband, 52, taking time off from his £400,000-a-year job running the International Rescue charity in New York to portray himself as the lost voice of the British people.His former constituency, South Shields, is in the South Tyneside area, which voted 68 per cent Leave in the referendum — not that listening to the people comes naturally to a man more used to hobnobbing with liberal darlings such as George Clooney and Hillary Clinton.  Tony Blair is behind the BRexit bashing comeback of former British foreign secretary David Miliband, Andrew Pierce writesHow piquant that Miliband Major has resurfaced just as his former role as foreign secretary is under the microscope. It was only last Thursday that Theresa May apologised over the Blair government’s involvement in the torture of a Libyan dissident by the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli.Miliband, who became foreign secretary three years later in 2007, has been accused of lying over what he knew about extraordinary rendition (the euphemism for the kidnap and torture of terror suspects overseen by the CIA) in an attempt to keep the New Labour government off the hook. Funny how he didn’t mention that at yesterday’s carefully stage-managed launch.Undoubtedly, his appearance with Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan will fuel speculation that he is planning to revive his political career.Diane Abbott is caught out posting a FAKE image of an...Beam them up! Star Trek captain joins MPs on Planet Bremoan...Share this articleOne reason why he left Britain was the falling-out with his brother. Relations became so poor that he failed to invite Ed to his 50th birthday party in London in 2015.But, intriguingly, David has now buried the hatchet with Ed. A friend of the family told me this week: ‘They will never be as close as they were, but they are talking again. They have young children and want the children to get together.’AttentionWhile Miliband has made a success of his new life in the U.S., he was bitterly disappointed that his friend Hillary Clinton failed to become the Democratic president. There was even talk of a big job under Clinton in the American government, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has forced Miliband to turn his attention to British politics once more.A return to these shores would offer tempting career prospects for Miliband’s wife, Louise Shackelton, a concert violinist. Last autumn, the celebrated conductor Sir Simon Rattle returned to Britain after more than a decade at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic. He is now director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). Despite living in New York, Ms Shackelton has played with the LSO in London since Rattle’s return, and there would be a permanent post if she wanted it. A complicating factor if the Milibands returned to Britain is that their young sons are happily settled in schools in New York.However, there is a ‘break clause’ this year in Miliband’s contract with International Rescue. That means the reaction to yesterday’s performance — among the public and from MPs — may have a major bearing on whether he has a future in British politics.While he is seen by Blairite MPs as his party’s lost leader, Miliband knows the chances of making a successful second bid for the leadership are challenging, to say the least.          Former foreign secretary David Miliband, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Nicky Morgan are launching anti-Brexit driveSaviourThe majority of Labour’s 500,000 members, who have the final say over the leadership, are followers of Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left politics, which means it might even be difficult for David Miliband to be selected for a safe Labour seat. The Corbynista roots already run deep, and they loathe Blairites almost as much as they hate Tories.But what if Miliband is not interested in leading Labour: what if he has ambitions to set up a new centrist party instead? It might appeal to his Remoaner chum Clegg, who is increasingly out of step with the Lib Dems since the collapse of the coalition, and to Tory malcontents such as Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, who were both sacked by Mrs May.The creation of a new party is, in fact, the brainchild of a businessman named Simon Franks, who is reportedly putting up £50 million to make it a reality, having made his fortune renting out DVDs. He has called it ‘Project One Movement for the UK’.Does Miliband see himself as the saviour of British politics, riding in on his white charger to plant his flag in the centre ground? Watch this space.Whether British voters will welcome the return of the ‘king across the water’ is rather less certain.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/01/4C3EBE0B00000578-5729169-image-m-41_1526343822117.jpg","title":"Gap apologizes T shirts printed map China map omits Taiwan","story":"    American clothing retailer Gap apologized for printing incomplete Chinese map on T-shirts for sales outside China          Chinese territories, including South Tibet, the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea were omitted from the map on the T-shirt\u0027We\u0027ve learned a Gap brand T-shirt sold in some overseas markets mistakenly failed to reflect the correct map of China.

The horse rescuer has revealed there has been a huge number of horses being mistreated There’s Daisy, found as a stray in the streets of Chessington Thelma and Louise, left loose in the back roads of Dunsfold Teddy, a young stallion dumped on private property, and Ziggy, another young stallion, abandoned with a filly to wander the lanes.Yesterday’s Mail carried the shocking picture of a pony dumped in the small garden of a home in Stoke-on-Trent.The owner had placed an online advert saying the pony would be put down if nobody could take it, and a 13-year-old girl replied with her grandmother’s address. A man then arrived, dumped the pony and disappeared. In the past few years, horses have been abandoned in their thousands — and it’s getting worse.The RSPCA said last month the number of horses it had rescued has hit a four-year high, with 980 horses being taken into care last year and an average of 80 phone calls a day coming in about horses. Many are in terrible health.Some come from breeders with too many foals who don’t care what happens to them, so long as it costs their business nothing.          Landowners are simply unable to keep their horses due to financial woes and others \u0027simply don\u0027t care\u0027 Jenny Seagrove saysSince the horse meat food scandal in 2013, when sickened shoppers learned that horseflesh was being used in many supermarket ‘beef’ products, the secretive market for human consumption has been shut off to these unscrupulous breeders.But with economic troubles, and the cost of land rising, many private owners are just unable to keep their horses.Some come to us in desperation. They have lost their jobs, fallen ill or been through a orce, and simply can’t afford to stable their beloved animal. Others are getting old and can no longer cope. In some cases, one horse has died and left a second miserable and lonely — a busy sanctuary is a happier place to spend twilight years than an empty field.I have deep sympathy with these owners. If they come to us, they are doing the best they can for their horses.But many others simply don’t care. They condemn their animals to live and die in conditions that beggar belief. Take Millie and Horus — a young mare, and a handsome stallion in his early 20s.They were left in a field of about 100 horses with no food or water. When rescuers found them, the field was scattered with dead and dying animals — Millie and Horus were among the survivors.Woman whose two thoroughbreds were so malnourished they had...A night-mare! Woody looks like the whitest horse in the...Share this articleTwo of our gentlest creatures are mother and daughter, Gwen and Phyllis. Gwen had been savagely beaten and tethered to a goalpost to give birth, and was cut loose, terrified and traumatised.It never fails to baffle me that people treat horses so brutally.One of our herd leaders was called Ernie, a gentle giant 18 hands high, a favourite with mares and visitors. Everyone loved Ernie. But it wasn’t always the case. When he came to us, he would bite the hands and faces of anyone who got too close. He’d been beaten so badly he defended himself against all humans. Gradually, we taught him he didn’t have to be afraid.This is the most rewarding work in the world. Mind you, I never set out to run a sanctuary. I’m an actress and I love my work.But, in 2011, someone I knew phoned me with a desperate problem: she was running a private animal rescue centre and had somehow acquired 40 horses and many other animals and birds.It was hardly surprising that she’d run out of money and I just couldn’t turn my back. I realised there was something I could do: I could start a charity that would take responsibility for the animals and their welfare. Little did I know what a huge task that would be.So with friends and the public being amazingly supportive, Mane Chance was born.It wasn’t all plain sailing. At 7am on the first Sunday after our horses moved into their new home, I had an anguished call from a neighbour. Quad bikers had charged through our field, knocked down the electric fences and spooked the horses . . . who were galloping round the 18th green of the local golf club, causing mayhem.          Jenny Seagrove: \u0027I wish I could say it was rare at Mane Chance Sanctuary to take animals that have been so horribly mistreated, but sadly it is all too common\u0027After six months, the ‘non-equine’ residents and some horses were rehomed, as we worked out a manageable number we could care for. Since 2011, that number has risen to 33 — any more and our staff, and tireless volunteers, risk being stretched too thin. Even within those limits, annual running costs are around £300,000. We’re supported by selfless donors, sponsors, grant givers and businesses, but because of the work we do with young people we need staff experienced at working with people as well as horses. And we need good facilities. It all costs money.Our work with young people began with two Shetland ponies called Grimbo and Mr Smith, who loved company.We took them to a local hospice, and I was amazed to see the powerful effect on children who sat or stood with them, stroking them, giving and receiving unconditional love. It was so moving to watch . . . and it gave me an idea.Most of our horses will never be ridden. Some are too old, others have arthritis. But they can help people, just by being horses. Not all our rescue animals are suitable for this work, but many love it.They seem to understand, when a child with a terminal illness, perhaps, or an older person with dementia, is quietly sharing their company, that they are doing important work.We don’t make any horse work if it doesn’t clearly want to. Most are only too happy to be fussed over, though. In fact, they are so content we’ve decided many will never be rehomed — they’ve endured desperate hardship, and now they’ve found a place they love. We owe them the chance to stay.But with Mane Chance at full capacity, and more calls each week, we need to do more. Tighter legislation is part of it: breeders must not continue to dump young stallions just because they have little use for them (unlike mares, which can bear foals).New laws on microchipping, which will lead to a national ownership register called the Central Equine Database, should help. So would better education for the public: people need to understand how costly it is to keep a horse.Humane euthanasia, when a sick animal needs to be put down, costs about £500, for example. It’s never an acceptable option to dump the poor creature in a field instead.Mane Chance is trying to show that horses don’t need to be thrown away. We dream of little rescued herds all over the country, helping people. We save them, but in many ways they save us, too.n The fee for this article has been donated to Mane Chance Sanctuary (manechance sanctuary.org). "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/05/4C3BEB3700000578-5704091-image-a-43_1526359822513.jpg","title":"Norwegian Bliss largest passenger vessel enter Panama Canal","story":"    Tourists watch the Norwegian Bliss ship transit through the Panama Canal, seen from the Visitors Center at the Panama Canal in Agua Clara, Panama, Monday, May 14, 2018          Norwegian Bliss, one of the largest ships to ever navigate the Panama Canal, is the largest ship in Norwegian\u0027s fleet, with 20 decks and a capacity of about 4,000 passengers          The Norwegian Bliss ship makes its way to the Panama Canal on Monday          Norwegian Bliss is the largest ship in Norwegian\u0027s fleet, with 20 decks and a capacity of about 4,000 passengers          Tourists watch the Norwegian Bliss ship transit through the Panama Canal, seen from the Visitors Center          Passengers of the Norwegian Bliss ship stand on their balconies as the ship makes its way through the canal, one of the largest ships to ever navigate it, in Agua Clara          The hand of a tourist waves to passengers of the Norwegian Bliss ship in this Monday photoAs it repositions from the Atlantic to the Pacific, it will become one of the largest ships to ever navigate the Panama Canal. Norwegian Bliss measures 41 meters wide and 333 meters long (135 by 1,093 feet), while the canal is 50 meters wide and 400 meters long (164 by 1,312 feet).Norwegian Bliss is the largest ship in Norwegian\u0027s fleet, with 20 decks and a capacity of about 4,000 passengers. Smuggling trio face nine years in jail for \u0027stripping...Hopping on board the Vikings\u0027 Caribbean conquest to discover...Share this articleAs cruise ships go, however, at least a half-dozen other ships are larger. Royal Caribbean\u0027s Symphony of the Seas, which also set sail this spring, is the world\u0027s largest, with a passenger capacity of 6,680.The hull of Norwegian Bliss features images of whales and other sea creatures designed by the artist Wyland, who is known for his depictions of marine life.

The route has taken Rob past many landmarks from the film, including the Marshall Point Lighthouse, in St. George, Maine\u0027I first had the idea to run across America 15 years ago. I thought it would be an incredible way to see a fascinating and beautiful country.\u0027I\u0027d had a number of half-hearted attempts trying to put a run together, but after watching Forrest Gump one night, I had a light-bulb moment.\u0027My mum, who unfortunately isn\u0027t around anymore, was very aware of our impact on the word and always urged me to \u0027do one thing in life that makes a difference.\u0027\u0027I hoped that this run would be an opportunity to do just that - I\u0027m sure she would be very proud.\u0027My girlfriend, Nadine friends and family have been hugely supportive - I think they\u0027ve been half expecting me to do something crazy like this for a while.\u0027It meant everything to me to have Nadine and our newborn daughter, Bee, there at the finish line.\u0027Nadine has been my rock, I couldn\u0027t have done it without her - proposing in that moment felt right.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show baby Bee all of the photos in a few years\u0027 time.\u0027         Though an accomplished marathon runner, Rob admits he wishes he\u0027d done more training prior to his arrival in the US, as a series of nasty injuries have nearly brought a premature end to his inconceivable passage.           Rob ran through many iconic US landmarks - including the midpoint of Route 66 (pictured)          Rob uses running shoes to mark out the 407th day of his 590 day run          Rob poses on the border of Utah with his newborn baby Bee, the same place Forrest ended his epic trek in the 1994 classic film          Rob runs through one of many valleys on his epic US trek          The run began in Mobile, Alabama, in September 2016 and has taken Rob from west to east coast and back again. He is now just 200 miles short of the finish line          Rob began his run in the plaid shirt and chinos made famous by Tom Hanks, but later changed for a bushy beard and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co hat, just like Forrest           Rob also found the time to run in the London Marathon, breaking a world record in the processFrom an inflamed Achilles to a quadriceps tear, the Liverpudlian has had to consistently grimace through the physical pain, while combating the psychological toll of exhaustion, too.Pausing his run briefly at the Twin Arrows Trading Post, in Arizona, to fly back to the UK to witness the birth of his daughter, Rob also found the time to run in the London Marathon, breaking a world record in the process.He became the fastest ever runner to complete the 26.2 mile course in costume, with a time of two hours and 36 minutes.          Rob poses on Route 66 - he says he has sent a postcard to Forrest Gump actor Tom Hanks about the journey          Rob Pope (pictured after finishing the London marathon) broken the Guinness World Record for the fastest male marathon runner in a film character costumeRob said: \u0027Seeing my daughter be born was even more motivation - having her and Nadine at the finish was a dream come true.\u0027I didn\u0027t do any training specifically for the run. I wish I had done, and maintained more core work.\u0027You didn\u0027t see Forrest doing a Rocky montage in the scenes building up to his run - he just put on his shoes and went. I figured I\u0027d do the same.\u0027After my first injury - anterior tibial tendinitis - only 400 miles in, I had a break down in a gas station in front of a poor attendant - I\u0027d put too much into everything to become a failure.          Rob Pope, 39, from Liverpool, has spent 19-months running the equivalent of 590 marathons in order to recreate the route taken by Forrest Gump in the film          In the 1994 film, Forrest completes his run after being left heartbroken by his love, Jenny. For Rob, it was the words of his late mother that inspired him. She once told him: \u0027Do one thing in life that makes a difference\u0027          Rod said he has contacted Tom Hanks about his run, sending him a postcard from Maine, but he has not heard back from the actor          Having completed more than 15,000 miles Rob took a temporary hiatus in order to travel back to the UK and see girlfriend Nadine give birth, he then proposed to her on the finish line\u0027The enormity of it all, the repetition and loneliness have been mentally very tough.\u0027Fortunately though, I was only ever down for short periods, even if illness or injury persisted longer than that.\u0027As a generally very positive person, I had a strong focus - quitting was never going to be an option.\u0027The London Marathon was an added bonus, despite being a hot day I just went for it and even got to meet two of my heroes, Mo Farah and Eliud Kipchoge - it was a great feeling.\u0027Hoping to inspire others with the spirit of Forrest, Rob, who is still yet to hear from his hero, Tom Hanks, said: \u0027I think the film - and specifically the character of Forrest - is a beautiful tale of life and how we should treat one another.Rob said he had been planning to run across America for 15 years, but decided to recreate Forrest\u0027s route while watching the film one evening          Much like Forrest Gump in the film, Rob\u0027s run attracted attention from the press  Rob pictured competing in a marathon before undertaking his epic run across America\u0027Forrest didn\u0027t judge anyone, not on the colour of their skin, background, intelligence or anything else.\u0027If everyone could be a bit more like Forrest, the world would be a better place.\u0027This is my attempt to make a difference, just as my mum would\u0027ve wanted.\u0027I haven\u0027t heard from Tom yet, but I have sent him a postcard of the Port Clyde Lighthouse, when I completed my second crossing.\u0027He\u0027s an absolute hero of mine, so I\u0027d love to hear from him.\u0027It hasn\u0027t been hard to return back to my old life, I\u0027m a bit weird like that.\u0027I\u0027m a bit weird like that, but the beard is still there and the memories will last a lifetime.\u0027The charities were my main motivation behind this, so I\u0027ll be disappointed if I don\u0027t get over the 100,000 mark.\u0027In the words of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, don\u0027t let all the running be in vain.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/09/4C424CD900000578-0-image-m-5_1526373099533.jpg","title":"Pope says hes thought time leave","story":"Pope Francis, flanked by Bishop Angelo De Donatis, delivered a speech during a meeting with the Roman diocese, at the Vatican Basilica of St. John at the Lateran, in Rome, on Monday, May 14  Pope Francis, 81, has spoken in a homily about when it might be the right time to \u0027take leave\u0027 of his flock He said: \u0027When I read this, I think about myself, because I\u0027m a bishop and I\u0027ll have to take my leave.\u0027Francis has previously said that retired Pope Benedict XVI \u0027opened a door\u0027 to future popes by resigning. Although the 81-year-old pope has said he does not envisage a long papacy, he has not yet revealed when, or whether, he plans to retire.Mormon church is severing all ties with Boy Scouts after 105...\u0027I don\u0027t like your religion.

Which presumably he would regard as a happy outcome. We mustn’t upset Brussels, after all.Many listeners would have concluded that a man who gives up his seat in Parliament and takes a huge salary abroad has no right to pontificate on our political future. Will voters really welcome him back to the country he abandoned?They will point to the irony in Miliband, 52, taking time off from his £400,000-a-year job running the International Rescue charity in New York to portray himself as the lost voice of the British people.His former constituency, South Shields, is in the South Tyneside area, which voted 68 per cent Leave in the referendum — not that listening to the people comes naturally to a man more used to hobnobbing with liberal darlings such as George Clooney and Hillary Clinton.  Tony Blair is behind the BRexit bashing comeback of former British foreign secretary David Miliband, Andrew Pierce writesHow piquant that Miliband Major has resurfaced just as his former role as foreign secretary is under the microscope. It was only last Thursday that Theresa May apologised over the Blair government’s involvement in the torture of a Libyan dissident by the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli.Miliband, who became foreign secretary three years later in 2007, has been accused of lying over what he knew about extraordinary rendition (the euphemism for the kidnap and torture of terror suspects overseen by the CIA) in an attempt to keep the New Labour government off the hook. Funny how he didn’t mention that at yesterday’s carefully stage-managed launch.Undoubtedly, his appearance with Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan will fuel speculation that he is planning to revive his political career.Diane Abbott is caught out posting a FAKE image of an...Beam them up! Star Trek captain joins MPs on Planet Bremoan...Share this articleOne reason why he left Britain was the falling-out with his brother. Relations became so poor that he failed to invite Ed to his 50th birthday party in London in 2015.But, intriguingly, David has now buried the hatchet with Ed. A friend of the family told me this week: ‘They will never be as close as they were, but they are talking again. They have young children and want the children to get together.’AttentionWhile Miliband has made a success of his new life in the U.S., he was bitterly disappointed that his friend Hillary Clinton failed to become the Democratic president. There was even talk of a big job under Clinton in the American government, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has forced Miliband to turn his attention to British politics once more.A return to these shores would offer tempting career prospects for Miliband’s wife, Louise Shackelton, a concert violinist. Last autumn, the celebrated conductor Sir Simon Rattle returned to Britain after more than a decade at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic. He is now director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). Despite living in New York, Ms Shackelton has played with the LSO in London since Rattle’s return, and there would be a permanent post if she wanted it. A complicating factor if the Milibands returned to Britain is that their young sons are happily settled in schools in New York.However, there is a ‘break clause’ this year in Miliband’s contract with International Rescue. That means the reaction to yesterday’s performance — among the public and from MPs — may have a major bearing on whether he has a future in British politics.While he is seen by Blairite MPs as his party’s lost leader, Miliband knows the chances of making a successful second bid for the leadership are challenging, to say the least.          Former foreign secretary David Miliband, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Nicky Morgan are launching anti-Brexit driveSaviourThe majority of Labour’s 500,000 members, who have the final say over the leadership, are followers of Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left politics, which means it might even be difficult for David Miliband to be selected for a safe Labour seat. The Corbynista roots already run deep, and they loathe Blairites almost as much as they hate Tories.But what if Miliband is not interested in leading Labour: what if he has ambitions to set up a new centrist party instead? It might appeal to his Remoaner chum Clegg, who is increasingly out of step with the Lib Dems since the collapse of the coalition, and to Tory malcontents such as Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, who were both sacked by Mrs May.The creation of a new party is, in fact, the brainchild of a businessman named Simon Franks, who is reportedly putting up £50 million to make it a reality, having made his fortune renting out DVDs. He has called it ‘Project One Movement for the UK’.Does Miliband see himself as the saviour of British politics, riding in on his white charger to plant his flag in the centre ground? Watch this space.Whether British voters will welcome the return of the ‘king across the water’ is rather less certain.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/01/4C3EBE0B00000578-5729169-image-m-41_1526343822117.jpg","title":"Gap apologizes T shirts printed map China map omits Taiwan","story":"    American clothing retailer Gap apologized for printing incomplete Chinese map on T-shirts for sales outside China          Chinese territories, including South Tibet, the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea were omitted from the map on the T-shirt\u0027We\u0027ve learned a Gap brand T-shirt sold in some overseas markets mistakenly failed to reflect the correct map of China.

She once told him: \u0027Do one thing in life that makes a difference\u0027          Rod said he has contacted Tom Hanks about his run, sending him a postcard from Maine, but he has not heard back from the actor          Having completed more than 15,000 miles Rob took a temporary hiatus in order to travel back to the UK and see girlfriend Nadine give birth, he then proposed to her on the finish line\u0027The enormity of it all, the repetition and loneliness have been mentally very tough.\u0027Fortunately though, I was only ever down for short periods, even if illness or injury persisted longer than that.\u0027As a generally very positive person, I had a strong focus - quitting was never going to be an option.\u0027The London Marathon was an added bonus, despite being a hot day I just went for it and even got to meet two of my heroes, Mo Farah and Eliud Kipchoge - it was a great feeling.\u0027Hoping to inspire others with the spirit of Forrest, Rob, who is still yet to hear from his hero, Tom Hanks, said: \u0027I think the film - and specifically the character of Forrest - is a beautiful tale of life and how we should treat one another.Rob said he had been planning to run across America for 15 years, but decided to recreate Forrest\u0027s route while watching the film one evening          Much like Forrest Gump in the film, Rob\u0027s run attracted attention from the press  Rob pictured competing in a marathon before undertaking his epic run across America\u0027Forrest didn\u0027t judge anyone, not on the colour of their skin, background, intelligence or anything else.\u0027If everyone could be a bit more like Forrest, the world would be a better place.\u0027This is my attempt to make a difference, just as my mum would\u0027ve wanted.\u0027I haven\u0027t heard from Tom yet, but I have sent him a postcard of the Port Clyde Lighthouse, when I completed my second crossing.\u0027He\u0027s an absolute hero of mine, so I\u0027d love to hear from him.\u0027It hasn\u0027t been hard to return back to my old life, I\u0027m a bit weird like that.\u0027I\u0027m a bit weird like that, but the beard is still there and the memories will last a lifetime.\u0027The charities were my main motivation behind this, so I\u0027ll be disappointed if I don\u0027t get over the 100,000 mark.\u0027In the words of Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris, don\u0027t let all the running be in vain.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/08/4C3AEB2900000578-0-image-a-3_1526369759087.jpg","title":"Pope says hes thought time leave","story":"Pope Francis, flanked by Bishop Angelo De Donatis, delivered a speech during a meeting with the Roman diocese, at the Vatican Basilica of St. John at the Lateran, in Rome, on Monday, May 14  Pope Francis, 81, has spoken in a homily about when it might be the right time to \u0027take leave\u0027 of his flock He said: \u0027When I read this, I think about myself, because I\u0027m a bishop and I\u0027ll have to take my leave.\u0027Francis has previously said that retired Pope Benedict XVI \u0027opened a door\u0027 to future popes by resigning. Although the 81-year-old pope has said he does not envisage a long papacy, he has not yet revealed when, or whether, he plans to retire.Mormon church is severing all ties with Boy Scouts after 105...\u0027I don\u0027t like your religion.

TSB was spun out of Lloyds in 2013 but had continued to pay for the use of its IT systems.Almost a week into the crisis, TSB drafted in a team from IBM to help solve it, after the chief executive, Paul Pester, admitted the bank was struggling to fix the problems with its internet banking and mobile app.The Labour MP John Mann, a member of the cross-party Treasury select committee, said TSB’s failure to accept help was a sign it had failed to acknowledge the scale of the problems and had been “hoping to get away with it”. “They were playing fast and loose with the customers and also with their reputation, which has been so damaged by it now,” he told the FT.Four weeks on from the IT transfer, some customers were still reporting problems accessing their accounts and transferring money.It is as yet unclear how much the botched IT transfer will cost TSB. The bank has repeatedly insisted that no customer would be left out of pocket as a result of the chaos. During a bruising evidence session before the Treasury select committee, Pester was accused by Nicky Morgan, the committee chair, of being “extraordinarily complacent” after he said the bank’s move to a new IT system had mostly run smoothly.Pester has volunteered to give up a £2m bonus linked to the IT transfer but he could still receive up to £1.3m in other bonuses for 2018 on top of a further £1.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions.Posts on TSB’s Twitter feed on Tuesday suggested the bank was still struggling to cope with the high volume of customer complaints.Lloyds declined to comment. A spokesperson for TSB declined to comment on the refusal of help from Lloyds. They said: “Our teams have continued to work around the clock to put things right for our customers.

Is this the future of urban employment?Nicole Tan, a 29-year-old content marketer from Singapore, has visited enough places in the last year to make an Instagram follower weep: Jamaica, Miami, Portland, San Francisco, LA, Budapest, Slovenia, Berlin, Luxembourg, Iceland, Romania, Poland, Paris, Amsterdam and Thailand.In almost all of those places, her working life has continued as usual. “Last year I was moving every other week, or almost every couple of days,” she says. “Time to go, time to go. I had to be at places.” Tan is one of a growing number of “location-independent workers”, or digital nomads. Like many of them, she often has to fly under the radar because governments don’t recognise the way she works.She and thousands of other nomads can travel on a tourist visa or work for a local company, but – though governments often turn a blind eye – it’s technically illegal for them to work remotely.But – in one city at least – that won’t be the case for long. I meet Tan at Lift99, a co-working space in Tallinn. It’s part of Telliskivi Creative City, a hive of colour and enterprise near the main railway station. Once home to the imposing Kalinin electronics factory, the complex now hosts 250 companies, eight restaurants and an arcade of independent shops. There are ping-pong tables. There’s a flea market. There’s a mural showing a skeleton photobombing a hipster’s selfie (a parody of Bernt Notke’s Danse Macabre, a major tourist draw in the nearby Niguliste church).Estonia has just announced the first official visa for digital nomads. The permit will entitle nomads to 365 days of working in Estonia, including 90 days’ travel in the Schengen area. Since EU citizens can already move and work freely, it is aimed at people from further afield: the US, Asia and Latin America (and potentially post-Brexit Britain). It will be launched in January 2019.“I think it’s great,” says Tan. “It’s about time we had something like this.”Famously, Estonia is the state where everything happens online. Internet access is enshrined as a basic human right. Seven-year-olds are taught to code. Citizens can vote, secure mortgages and open bank accounts via the second-fastest public wifi in the world. You can open a business in 10 minutes without leaving your cafe table.It’s also a nation entranced by the power of startups, where there’s a revolving door between the tech scene and government. As a result, the vaunting utopianism of its digital gurus often finds its way into government policy.In case you hadn’t heard – and you will if you visit – Tallinn is the birthplace of Skype, whose phenomenal success in the early 2000s was built around a core of work by Estonian developers. It showed the youth of this wintry former Soviet state that great things were possible like the legendary Velvet Underground gig, everyone who was there went on to start something else.“It almost feels like startups have taken over the city,” according to Norris Koppel, the CEO of Monese, a banking app. The wall at Lift99 features an #EstonianMafia Wall of Fame, which lists firms that have hit $5m in investment: Pipedrive, TransferWise, Funderbeam, Taxify.It’s even a startup that is spearheading the digital nomad visa: Jobbatical, which encourages businesses to cast their recruitment nets wider than usual. In the company’s office, which occupies a converted apartment block in Tallinn’s formerly industrial Kalamaja district, amid beanbags, bowls of sweets and motivational wall quotes (“Don’t wait to be asked” “Go beyond yourself”), the staff of 39 drawn from 15 different nationalities work to link roving digital workers with employers across the globe.Jobbatical’s founder and CEO, Karoli Hindriks, first discussed a digital nomad visa with Estonia’s youthful president, Kersti Kaljulaid, over a year ago, and harbours a bold dream of a future without national boundaries.“Borders are not the reflection of policy and politicians,” she said in a Ted talk delivered late last year. “They are the reflection of the borders in our heads. They are the borders that keep us from pursuing our dreams … You, me, us – we are the border guards of our lives.” Killu Vantsi at the Ministry of the Interior has the more mundane task of removing the diplomatic clouds from this blue-sky vision.“To be honest, the workforce in the globalised world is very mobile,” she says. “The rules for visas and work permits are based on the classic work situation, where you live and work in one place, but the rules have not gone together with developments in the work field. So it’s time, we think.”Roving trade, you could say, is in Tallinn’s blood. In the 850 years since it was first marked on a map by an Arab geographer, the city has played host to merchants of every stripe, drawn to its coastal position linking Europe and Russia. Since the 12th century, it has been conquered by Swedish and German armies Russia has occupied it three times, for a total of 250 years. It’s a city that understands open borders.The last time the Soviets rolled in, they stayed for most of the 20th century. So, after gaining independence in 1991, Estonia fought its way out of the resulting slump by turning to the west – and by investing heavily in digital infrastructure.Its much-publicised e-residency scheme, launched in 2014, offers citizens everywhere access to its online platforms without them having to actually live in the country. E-residents can start a business, process payments and sign documents online, just like ordinary Estonians. It is clear that Tallinn wants to court a specific type of person: the world’s laptop-wielding transnationals. Even the job title given to e-residency’s head marketer smacks of Silicon Valley: “chief evangelist”. “It’s something a lot of tech companies have,” says Adam Rang, who holds the post. “We like to think of ourselves as a government startup.”His pitch is well-polished. “People say e-residency is trying to change the world. We say no: the world has already changed. We’re trying to catch up,” he tells me at Tallinn Creative Hub. Formerly the Tallinn City Central Power Station, this brooding industrial monolith was used by Andrei Tarkovsky in his 1979 film Stalker. “We made sure Estonians can do everything online – long before digital nomads were even a thing,” says Rang. “So it makes sense that, if we’ve got those opportunities, we should offer them to non-Estonians as well.”The programme initially set the grandiose aim of 10 million “digital citizens” by 2025 it currently has 40,000, and has revised its target to 20,000 e-residency companies by 2021. Meanwhile, it is pushing ahead with a LinkedIn-style social network and an app, to be launched this summer.Officially, e-residency is not a route to full residency, but “there is a path”, Rang says. “Once e-residents travel here and start doing business with Estonian companies, it becomes very easy to take the step to live here as well.”In November, the number of monthly applications exceeded the country’s birth rate. At a time when Estonia needs to attract 440,000 immigrants just to retain its current population size of 1.3 million, e-residency and the digital nomad visa could be seen as clever border policy: with 65 million citizens going spare in the age of migration, it’s a diplomatic sleight of hand to select the digitally savvy among them.Memory here is long. Just 30 seconds’ walk from where Vantsi and her team fine-tune the country’s borderless visions are the underground cells at Pagari 1, where Estonian nationalists were interrogated by the KGB. “I don’t know an Estonian person who doesn’t have a story of somebody in their family being directly affected by being killed or being tortured, so it’s pretty raw,” says Daniel James Coll, a British Lasnamäe resident who recently ran for local government on a platform of improving infrastructure and healing isions.The city reflects this continuing mistrust. “You go to parts of Tallinn and you’ll see places that are as managed and well-kept as the best part of smaller English towns. And then you come here, and you’ll see that these crossovers are falling apart, and there’s no signage on the roads, no lines on the roads. The government just don’t bother putting money into it. It happens on every level,” says Coll. Meanwhile, cracks are forming in the digital facade. The country’s top banks have been closing the accounts of e-residents en masse, triggered by a wave of money-laundering accusations in the Baltics. On Facebook forums, debates multiply about where exactly e-residents are taxed and what the scheme entitles them to.“Right now, we’re a bit like savages. We just offer something, without knowing what the consequences might be,” says business lawyer Sten Luiga. “Government officials like e-residency, because they have something to speak about when they visit their colleagues abroad. But it is almost impossible to understand what Estonia really gains from it. And people are becoming sceptical because there are no answers.”Luiga is concerned that upscaling the project so rapidly makes it hard for Tallinn’s banking and legal communities to anticipate the risks. “The programme has been run as a startup, because our government is young and enthusiastic so they try to impress. However the government, a responsible government, can’t act in the way that startups act. Nine out of 10 startups don’t fly. You can’t shut down the only government we have because it didn’t fly.”Even more scathing about the state’s e-topian vision of a “borderless digital nation” is Dario Cavegn, a Swiss journalist at ERR, the Estonian national broadcaster. He scribbles on a piece of paper in the office’s cafeteria to show how it easy it would be for e-residents to move money out of the country through loans, default on their debts, and open another company within minutes. “You don’t know what people are using this kind of setup for. You have no idea,” he says. “The government provides a legal framework, but they haven’t taken into consideration what happens once a system like that is freely available.”In other words, it’s classic startup behaviour. With a startup, you develop a “minimum viable product”, Cavegn says, and go to market as soon as you can in a bid to attract buzz. “It’s like these guys don’t realise the real-life implications of what they’re doing, and that nothing is actually quite that simple.” He chuckles. “I would really like to know: if e-residency is so important and if everybody’s been waiting for this, where are the masses that were supposed to come kicking down our door? Where the hell are all these people?”Even the sceptics seem to agree that Tallinn is on the right track, though. The city’s youth are broadly excited about the tech scene, which they consider Estonia’s best chance of prosperity the country’s movers and shakers are young, energetic and full of ideas (Estonia’s prime minister is 39, its president 48). “Estonia had 20-odd years of independence before the second world war and the Soviet occupation, and then the utter omnishambles the place was after 1991, and they pulled themselves out of it by the boot straps,” Cavegn says. “The whole digital thing was a lifeline.” Out of its post-Soviet ruin, Tallinn has rebuilt itself as a borderless digital city of the future, moving with a speed and flexibility that older bureaucracies lack. It’s a place where ideas progress smoothly – sometimes too smoothly – from corporate thinkspace to reality, and which is cleverly positioned to attract the wandering digital workers who are predicted to number a billion by 2035.Tech idealism and state government aren’t natural bedfellows, however. Startups run on a rhetoric of irrational daring: if you can dream it, you can do it. Governments, on the other hand, have to work responsibly to protect every member of society. For all its advances, Estonia still struggles with the worst income inequality in Europe.Similarly, it’s a grand aim to conjure up a digital nomad hotspot from scratch. Tallinn has a long way to go before it catches global magnets such as Medellín or Chiang Mai, where the coconut cocktails are on tap and the sun rarely stays hidden for long. In the Estonian capital on the day the new visa was announced, it was -11C. But the culture here is of a shoot-for-the-moon optimism. “The streetlamps might be rusty and the roads might not be quite right, but what they are planning to do is running,” says Coll. “And they’re just going to keep going until it works.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d19837441c9172fe1e0959056316fbbc841d42e/670_338_1435_862/master/1435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2addfc7bc6744282e337765f41c56120","title":"why finlands cities are havens for library lovers oodi helsinki","story":"Helsinki’s state-of-the-art Oodi library will stand opposite parliament and boast a cinema, recording studio and makerspace. It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next levelHelsinki’s state-of-the-art Oodi library will stand opposite parliament and boast a cinema, recording studio and makerspace. It’s a perfect fit for a literate nation taking public learning to the next level“A library card was the first thing that was mine, that I had ever owned,” says Nasima Razmyar. The daughter of a former Afghan diplomat, Razmyar arrived in Finland with her family in 1992 as a refugee fleeing political unrest. Unable to speak the language, with scant resources, and trying to make sense of the strange new city she found herself in, she was stunned to discover she was entitled to a library card that would grant her books – for free. Her appreciation of the privilege has not faded: “I still have that library card in my wallet today,” she says proudly.Today, Razmyar is deputy mayor of Helsinki, and ready to champion the institution that has given her so much – starting with the construction of Oodi, the city’s new central library, due to open in December. She is not alone in her passion for libraries. “Finland is a country of readers,” declared the country’s UK ambassador Päivi Luostarinen recently, and it’s hard to argue with her. In 2016 the UN named Finland the world’s most literate nation, and Finns are among the world’s most enthusiastic users of public libraries – the country’s 5.5m million people borrow close to 68m books a year.Oodi – Ode in English – is more than a sober monument to civic pride. Commissioned as part of Finland’s celebration of a century of independence, the library is no mere book repository. “I think Finland could not have given a better gift to the people. It symbolises the significance of learning and education, which have been fundamental factors for Finland’s development and success,” says Razmyar. Libraries are seen as the visible face of the Finnish belief in education, equality and good citizenship. “There’s strong belief in education for all,” says Hanna Harris, director of Archinfo Finland and Mind-building’s commissioner. “There is an appreciation of active citizenship – the idea that it is something that everyone is entitled to. Libraries embody that strongly,” she adds.Those feelings of pride in the equality of opportunity offered by the city’s new library are echoed by the site chosen for Oodi: directly opposite parliament. “I think there is no other actor that could stand in front of the grounds of democracy like the public library does,” says Razmyar. “It’s remarkable that when standing on the open balcony of the library people are looking straight into the parliament and standing on the same level.”But Oodi isn’t the only Helsinki library to cause excitement. “Töölö library is one of my favourites,” says Harris. “It’s set in a park and has a rooftop balcony. Recently my colleagues and I went down there and there was a queue outside the doors – on a regular weekday morning, there was a queue at 9am to get in.”Perhaps a clue to the Finnish enthusiasm for libraries comes from the fact that they offer far more than books. While many libraries worldwide provide internet access and other services, libraries in cities and towns across Finland have expanded their brief to include lending e-publications, sports equipment, power tools and other “items of occasional use”. One library in Vantaa even offers karaoke.These spaces are not designed to be dusty temples to literacy. They are vibrant, well-thought-out spaces actively trying to engage the urban communities who use them. The library in Maunula, a northern Helsinki suburb, has a doorway that leads directly to a supermarket – a striking and functional decision which, along with its adult education centre and youth services section, was partly down to the fact that it was designed with input from locals. Oodi, however, will go even further: in addition to its core function as a library, it will boast a cafe, restaurant, public balcony, cinema, audiovisual recording studios and a makerspace with 3D printers. A sauna was apparently considered, but seems not to have made the final cut.This ersity is key, argues Razmyar. “Libraries must reach out to the new generations. The world is changing – so libraries are changing too. People need places to meet, to work, to develop their digital skills.”The site and design of Helsinki’s new library are certainly striking, but perhaps the most impressive thing about it is the lack of public opposition to such a costly project. “People are looking forward to Oodi. It’s not been contentious: people are excited about it across the board,” says Archinfo director Harris. “It will be important to daily life here in Helsinki.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c35f1014a394d8519a6b7f85b48d86f2b631a3c2/0_153_4664_2799/master/4664.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b98970d0a763b3348351ea9e4b534e94","title":"today is nabka day i hope i never see another like this one","story":"The violent creation of Israel took place 70 years ago, but for the Palestinian people the ‘catastrophe’ continues• Manuel Hassassian is Palestinian ambassador to the UKToday is also the day after the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem, and the day after Israeli troops fired live bullets on unarmed demonstrators, slaughtering more than 50 people at the Gaza border. The surreal celebratory spectacle in Jerusalem – with the messianic evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress blessing proceedings that had been boycotted by local Christian and Muslim leaders – was an alternative universe to the scenes at the Gaza border, where Palestinians were declaring that they exist as a people and have a right to return to their land as enshrined in UN resolutions. They spoke, as all subalterns do, with their bodies and their blood. This is what Donald Trump’s “deal of the century” has come to.It is the last the last time I will commemorate the Nakba in my current office and I hope I never see another like this one. Very soon I will move on from my role as Palestinian ambassador to the UK, which I have held since 2005.I survived four British prime ministers during my tenure. A common stand was held by both parties in their non-recognition of the state of Palestine and their unequivocal political and military support for Israel. However, with the exception of Tony Blair, the Labour party has shown more consistent and genuine support for the Palestinian cause.There has been a dramatic shift in British public opinion, however, from majority support for Israel to increasing popular support for Palestinian human rights, and an increasing understanding of the issues, despite the mainstream media’s pro-Israeli bias. The veil of Israeli spin is falling away and any fair-minded person is bound to think that when a country imprisons children for slapping a soldier and poets for writing verses of resistance, and shoots at unarmed demonstrators, there must be something very wrong. Consequently, I have seen a real ergence in the attitude of the government and the public.On the podium, at the rallies, on the university campuses and at the public meetings, I have always been warmly received. There was no shortage of Israeli violence to prompt this grassroots support, which included three murderous Israeli bombing attacks on Gaza. Yesterday’s events are a case in point.My reception at the Foreign Office has been less warm during my diplomatic career here. In discussions with various ministers for the Middle East, I have often felt that I was in a room with Israeli rather than British officials. I was often exasperated by the dismissal of the reasonable arguments I made.British foreign policy as a whole has not changed dramatically in relation to Palestine. It espouses the two-state solution, but, regrettably, it has done nothing to hasten this outcome or actively support it. It has, however, had its differences with US foreign policy in relation to conflict in the region, most recently with Trump’s killing of the Iran deal. It has also adopted an opposed position to Trump’s disastrous decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the US embassy there. Today the Palestinian leadership again condemned the move. It has expressed its utter despair and frustration with the US administration’s unequivocal support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s extreme rightwing government and has prompted it to sever ties with the US and denounce it as a dishonest broker for peace.The Palestinian leadership is putting its house in order with elections of new members of the PNC (the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s national council) as well as for its executive committee and central council. New strategies and political programmes are evolving to deal with the new realities. As things stand, it is utterly hopeless to negotiate with the Israel’s present government. It seems we have come to a total impasse. The regional conflict is not helping, either, and the future of the Middle East is on the brink. Without a just solution for the Palestinians, there will never be stability.

The family had been evicted and the children had very little to eat.”Jackson’s school, Maryland primary in Stratford, is in a deprived area of east London. As well as suffering homelessness, her pupils are regularly victims of domestic violence. “I realised that my role had changed. Unless I addressed our children’s wellbeing, their education was not going to have impact at all.”Jackson is not alone in feeling this way. As Education   recently reported, teachers are reaching into their own pockets to pay for anything from pregnancy tests to funerals for families at their schools. But not all staff can afford this. Teachers’ charities are seeing an increase in the number of teachers who are themselves struggling to make ends meet, with twice as many education workers applying for financial assistance grants from Turn2Us in 2017, compared with 2010. When some teachers are in dire financial circumstances themselves, how can they help their pupils get the long-term support these many children so desperately need?Jackson turned to the education charity School-Home Support (SHS). Using money from her pupil premium budget, she installed an SHS practitioner in the school full time. Schools with these practitioners can access the charity’s welfare fund, which buys items for struggling families such as food, washing machines and school uniforms. The charity can also support families in navigating the benefits systems and court orders.Jackson has helped more than 100 families at her school this way. For example, her SHS practitioner realised a young pupil was stealing from classmates’ lunchboxes to feed her baby sister. The girl, her parents and her eight siblings had no access to benefits and were living in squalid accommodation and struggling to get to food banks, so the charity paid for a weekly food shop (carried out and delivered by Jackson herself), toothpaste, clothes, shoes and bedding for the children. The SHS practitioner also organised emergency help from social services and English lessons, and helped the parents find work and access child benefits. The practitioner’s placement does not always cost a school money, says the charity’s chief executive, Jaine Stannard, who urges all teachers needing help to get in touch: “Sometimes the work can be partially or fully funded by our partners, so it’s really helpful if schools register their interest.”The charity offers free membership to schools that cannot afford or do not need a full-time practitioner. This gives school staff access to SHS’s online forum, , for example, where they can ask about accessing food banks and other resources, and talk about pastoral problems.Another organisation, The Red Box Project, delivers free sanitary products to schools and colleges across the UK, and reports new schools and groups signing up each month. Freda, an online retailer of organic, eco-friendly sanitary towels and tampons, donates products to the project and allows its customers to do the same. “By providing these products for free for schoolgirls, we are allowing them to attend school all month with dignity,” says Affi Parvizi-Wayne, founder of Freda.The Trussell Trust food charity wants schools to know they can sign up to hold vouchers for their local food bank. Referring families for emergency food in the short term will not only help with families’ immediate needs, it will enable volunteers at the foodbank to talk to them about other services they can access for long-term help, the charity says.Quaker Social Action is keen to help families struggling to pay for pupils’ funerals and funeral-related debt. It also offers advice on how bereaved families can get help from employers, the government and other\u0026nbsporganisations and can put families in contact with children’s funeral directors who may be willing to waive their costs.“In the past, we’ve had a headteacher get in touch after becoming concerned about a pupil’s situation at home after a parental bereavement,” says spokesperson Giles Robinson. “Our advice on ways to raise money and heavily reduce cost can help families like this avoid debt and further grief.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5586a4336b5318fe7d034d3ab4ce2dda79c84ff9/0_34_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b581d0e1398cf333422c62160e191e14","title":"london considering car free days in bid to tackle air pollution","story":"City Hall sources say mayor is hoping to introduce separate car-free days in each borough this year, with ‘more ambitious plans’ for 2019London is considering introducing car-free days in an attempt to tackle the city’s air pollution crisis that experts say is responsible for thousands of early deaths each year.Officials at City Hall were due to meet on Tuesday to examine how best to roll out a ban across specific areas of the capital on different days this year - with “more ambitious plans” in the pipeline for 2019.A source at City Hall said details were still being hammered out but they were hoping to introduce separate car-free days in each London borough this year, with the potential for city-wide car-free days next year. “The mayor already supports a number of car-restricted days for annual events in London, and he has asked City Hall officials to consider additional opportunities for car-free activities as part of his healthy streets vision,” they said.“Tackling toxic emissions from the most polluting vehicles is a core part of the hard-hitting measures the mayor has introduced to help clean up London’s air, from delivering the Toxicity-Charge (T-Charge) in central London, to the early introduction of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone, and transforming the bus fleet.”Cities around the world have turned to car-free days in the fight against air pollution and there has been a growing campaign for London to follow suit.The move comes amid growing concern about the impact of the UK’s poisonous air that causes 40,000 early deaths a year. Earlier this year an unprecedented joint inquiry by four committees of MPs described it as a “national health emergency”. In the report, the “super committee” was scathing about the government’s clean air plans which have been judged illegal three times in the high court. The latest proposal, rejected by the high court earlier this year, was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors.London’s air pollution crisis is responsible for 9,000 early deaths each year. Its scale was laid bare last year with new figures showing that every person in the capital is breathing air that exceeds global guidelines for one of the most dangerous toxic particles.The findings, described as “sickening” by Khan, have serious health implications – especially for children – with both short- and long-term exposure to these particulates increasing the likelihood of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Health experts say young people exposed to these toxic pollutants are more likely to grow up with reduced lung function and to develop asthma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/534c3c048403084c5418cb1258f9758be8d8cc31/0_0_1957_1174/master/1957.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bf2b54300d21873e536deff92773e81","title":"timor lestes incredible marine life in pictures","story":"Situated in the heart of the ‘coral triangle’, this young nation boasts some of the most bioerse waters in the world.

Advance word on the film suggested that it would feature scenes of sadistic violence and brutality, with Cannes director Thierry Frémaux saying that it featured “a subject so controversial” that it could only appear in an out-of-competition slot at the festival.That advance billing seems to have been lived up to, with Variety’s Ramin Setoodeh reporting more than 100 people leaving the cinema prematurely due to the film’s “disgusting” content. “Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic,” wrote one attendee on Twitter, while entertainment reporter Roger Friedman described it as a “vile movie” that “should not have been made”. “He mutilates Riley Keough, he mutilates children... and we are all there in formal dress expected to watch it?” another viewer told Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan. Al Jazeera’s Charlie Angela also left the screening early, stating that “seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment”.The scene which seems to have prompted the majority of walkouts is one in which Dillon’s character shoots two children at a family picnic in the head with a rifle. In another Keogh’s character is seen having her breast sliced off, while a flashback scene shows a child removing a duckling’s leg with a pair of pliers. Archive footage from concentration camps is also shown.Von Trier was making his first appearance on the Croisette since being declared “persona not grata” by the festival over a 2011 press conference in which he joked about sympathising with the Nazis. At the time the Cannes board declared the director’s comments “unacceptable, intolerable, and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival”. However, last month Cannes overturned the ban, with Frémaux saying that it was a “punishment that was disproportionate and that had lasted long enough”. That decision was greeted negatively in some quarters, with critics pointing to allegations made by the musician Björk, who claimed that Von Trier had sexually harassed her on the set of his film Dancer in the Dark. Von Trier denies the allegations.Critical response to The House That Jack Built has been largely negative. In a two-star review, the ’s Peter Bradshaw wrote that the film was “an ordeal of gruesomeness and tiresomeness that was every bit as exasperating as I had feared”, though he did admit that he was impressed by its “spectacular horror finale”. Also giving the film two stars was the ’s Robbie Collin, who wrote it “feels like way too much and nowhere near enough”, while, in an F-grade review, The Playlist’s Jessica Kiang described it as “misogynistic” and “irredeemably unpleasant”.Not everyone seems to have been appalled by The House That Jack Built, however. Setoodeh reports that the film received a standing ovation at the Cannes premiere, which prompted someone sitting near him to declare: “They’ll clap for anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eef7f20e907fac427c055f31fd7c93b3d30e8b4/559_304_910_546/master/910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2497a7c7d9eedad07485a9b73f53b5a","title":"joe hart england world cup squad out gareth southgate west ham","story":"Joe Hart has become the first high-profile omission from England’s squad for the summer’s World Cup after Gareth Southgate opted against selecting the national side’s most experienced current player for the tournament in Russia.The Manchester City goalkeeper, who has spent the season on loan at West Ham, was told on Monday in a phone-call from Southgate that he would not be travelling to a fifth major finals despite the national manager having considered the 31-year-old his first-choice for much of his tenure. Hart won his 75th and most recent cap against Brazil in November, but Jordan Pickford and Jack Butland started the friendlies in March and have now usurped him in the pecking order.The suggestion had been Hart would still travel to the World Cup as an experienced third-choice – only Gary Cahill and Jermain Defoe of Southgate’s recent selections have more than 50 caps, with neither expected to make the cut for Russia – and would have been willing to fulfil that role, but his toils at club level appear to have counted against him.He has endured an indifferent spell with West Ham this season, losing his place towards the end of November to Adrián and starting only 19 league games in total. He regained his place after a 4-1 defeat at Swansea in March, but there were subsequent high-profile errors against Burnley and Stoke. His last appearance was a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on 22 April.Burnley’s Nick Pope, who was called up for the games against the Netherlands and Italy but remains uncapped, is the likeliest to replace Hart in the 23-man squad, which Southgate will reveal on Wednesday. The England manager submitted a provisional 35-man squad to Fifa on Monday.Hart, who was Fabio Capello’s third-choice at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa but did not feature, has a year to run on his contract at City but has not featured for Pep Guardiola since his appointment as manager in the summer of 2016. The goalkeeper, who spent the previous season on loan at Torino, with mixed results, and his representative are due to meet with the Premier League champions to discuss his future, with City unlikely to price him out of the market to move on.The Burnley defender James Tarkowski is expected to be on the standby list. He has made one England appearance, against Italy in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05fd55233689493f61f4e7fbdaee35e71cb3603f/0_135_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c2c0fae051dc6e8aa609e3d38389daf","title":"chelsea manchester city title womens super league","story":"Chelsea can win the Women’s Super League on Tuesday to crown a season in which their experience, squad depth and goalscoring powers have given them the edgeThe final Women’s Super League One season before the autumn rebrand and restructure draws to a close this weekend. On Tuesday night, Chelsea will be crowned champions with one game to play if they avoid defeat at Bristol City. That is not a conclusion everyone had seen coming.At the end of January the top tier looked very much like the men’s Premier League. Manchester City were dominant, having won all seven league games and 17 in a row across three competitions. Although Chelsea had dropped two points, it felt as though the title was City’s to lose.Since then, however, Nick Cushing’s City side have picked up 11 points from a possible 27, fewer than Birmingham, Chelsea, Reading, Arsenal and sixth-placed Liverpool. They lost the League Cup final against Arsenal and, whereas Chelsea remain unbeaten in the league, City have lost four games, crumbling at the business end – three of those coming in their past five matches.Now, with two games to play, they sit six points below Emma Hayes’s Chelsea. So where did it go wrong?It is fairly simple. Whereas Chelsea have built a deep and experienced squad capable of competing on all fronts, City have not. Both sides have lost players to injury, some long-term, yet Hayes has still been able to rotate and has always had someone capable of stepping into the breach – most notably Maren Mjelde moving into the back four from midfield with ease.Whereas the average age of defenders used by Chelsea is 26, City’s is 24. The midfield average age gap is even bigger, Chelsea’s 27 to City’s 24. City’s team is young and their squad is younger.So while Chelsea have been able to rely on experience in their backline (players range from 24 to 33 outside their most-used back-four) City have had the talented but less experienced Mie Jans, 24, Megan Campbell, 24, and Esme Morgan, 17, to fall back on. Chelsea’s more experienced regular defence have this season played 13 fewer games between them than City’s over-relied-on back four of Jen Beattie, Abbie McManus, Demi Stokes and Steph Houghton.In midfield the problem is the same: four Chelsea players have played fewer than 28 games this season (only the veteran Katie Chapman reached 29) as Hayes has rotated to deal with the fixture pile-up caused by the team’s progress in two domestic cups and to the Champions League semis. At City, three midfielders have played more than 28 games, with 21-year-old Kiera Walsh playing 34 across all competitions. No wonder City players have started to show signs of fatigue.Both sides have a wealth of attacking talent but City have lacked a real goalscorer. Fran Kirby has 25 goals for Chelsea as part of a potent frontline, all of whom have chipped in. But City have not had a stand-out player up front. They brought in German forward Pauline Bremer from Lyon in exchange for arguably the world’s best right-back, Lucy Bronze, in the summer, but three games in, and after she had scored her first goal, Bremer suffered a horrific leg break.As the margins City were winning by began to shrink, Cushing turned to the Portland Thorns and Denmark forward Nadia Nadim in the January transfer window. After scoring six minutes into her debut against Reading, then the winner in City’s Continental Cup semi against Chelsea, she looked to have settled in well. But she trailed off disappointingly, making six starts and scoring two goals in 14 appearances. City allowed Toni Duggan to leave for Barcelona in the summer and with the striker finishing as Barça’s top scorer, with 14 goals in all competitions, their failure to recruit suitable back-up or to deepen the squad seems to have been costly.Chelsea won the FA Cup final this month and if they wrap up the double on Tuesday, or at Liverpool on Sunday, they will be worthy winners. Their exciting, interchangeable attack has been anchored by a rock-solid defence, and City have struggled to play with as much verve.Even if Chelsea seal the title on Tuesday there will be much to play for behind them. The restructure of the pyramid means there will be no relegation but at the top end three points separate second and fifth. If City continue their slide they run the risk of finishing without a trophy and outside the two Champions League places, with Arsenal on their heels and Reading still with an outside chance.Anyone pining for football now the Premier League season has finished could do a lot worse than watching a gripping WSL1 term reach its conclusion.• Doncaster Rovers Belles won Women’s Super League Two after Durham put four past title-chasing Brighton. Belles celebrated with a win against third-place Millwall, Jade Pennock’s strike taking a heavy deflection to inflict Millwall’s first home defeat since February 2017. Belles’ striker Jessica Sigsworth is on course to finish as WSL2’s top scorer she has 11 goals, one more than team-mate Kirsty Hanson and Durham’s Beth Hepple with a game to play.• Lyon secured the Division 1 Féminine title for a record 16th time and 12th in a row. They sealed the title without dropping a point, scoring 98 goals and conceding five, a 7-0 win against Marseille pulling them out of reach of Paris St-Germain. Lyon face PSG in their final game before travelling to Kiev to play Wolfsburg in the Champions League final as they aim for another treble.• Atlético Madrid saw off Barcelona to retain their La Liga Iberdrola title by one point. Atlético beat Zaragoza 6-1 on the final day while Barcelona put five past Levante. Barcelona, having recruited hard, including Toni Duggan from Manchester City and the Euro 2017 winner Lieke Martens, were favourites to pip Atlético to top spot. Atleti have announced the signing of this season’s top scorer Charlyn Corral from Levante.• New Zealand Football and the NZ Professional Footballers’ Association have negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that gives the women’s national team equal pay, equal prize money, equal rights for image use and, crucially, travel parity when representing the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a43a83fc9b4f39a1ad93768db9249225a0f1d34f/144_429_4418_2652/master/4418.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bdc002432ce5af7e3d8973a318031f3","title":"gareth southgate england world cup principles","story":"Southgate is picking his World Cup squad and there are players he should choose even if they lack international experienceIt is that time of year again. The hawthorns are in bloom. The cow parsley is high. Men in shorts have already begun to gather cautiously in public places, puffing their chests, milk-white ankles proudly bared. And by Wednesday lunchtime mid-summer will make an early appearance with the announcement of an England squad for the World Cup in Russia.It is generally assumed Gareth Southgate is getting his selection for Russia 2018 out there a little early for the simple reason the squad basically picks itself. In the best possible sense this has become the most managed, carefully pondered England era, with no place for the last-second celebrity metatarsal dash, the drama of the Hoddle-style hotel squad countdown or any kind of Crouchie-doing-the-robot for Prince William triumphalism.Even now some insist on calling Southgate an FA man, a stuffed blazer there to manage by committee and shore up his own position. This is presumably a kind of prejudice based on his lack of star wattage, a route taken into the job via the youth teams that would in any other country seem entirely logical.To others Southgate may still seem a little nice, coming across in his first year in the job like the kind of soulfully doomed supply teacher who tries to engage with the kids by talking to them about their feelings, but who will inevitably get home and discover his briefcase has been filled with custard and someone has written “” in chalk on the back of his jacket.This is to misjudge him. In reality Southgate is a reformer in the most low-key, quietly English tradition. The two best parts of his time in the England job have been his refreshingly brusque approach to the selection of celebrity or big-club players who are either over the hill or unfit and secondly the intellectual rigour to pursue a system and a set of tactics to the exclusion of most other considerations.It is to be hoped Southgate’s first tournament squad can reflect these strengths. This is not the moment for turning back as so many have in the past. As recently as the buildup to the last European Championship Roy Hodgson embarked on a series of bold friendly international experiments before losing his nerve at the last and reinserting Wayne Rooney into the centre of his young England team like a teeth‑sticking deep-fried jam doughnut plonked into the middle of a light rocket salad.The player pool may be shallow. Southgate himself may have predicted a no-shocks selection but there is still time to make a statement on the details. There are three ways Southgate can go when the squad offers a choice. He can pick a form player he can pick a faithful name from a well-known club or he can pick a young player with the capacity to put into play his distinctive vision of the passing game, that high-energy patience football that someone somewhere has decided is the English footballing DNA.Generally England managers have gone with the well-known names. Hence a succession of interminable, largely inconsequential tournament careers for middling players from A‑list clubs.In practice this is the difference between picking Danny Welbeck or Ademola Lookman in attack between picking Trent Alexander‑Arnold or Chris Smalling as a defender (with Kyle Walker as a right-sided centre-back making this a reasonable toss-up).Neither of these choices is likely to have any lasting effect on the destiny of the 2018 Fifa World Cup. But the look and feel of an England squad, the sense of social mobility, of some kind of shared purpose to the squad, rests on staying true to principles Southgate has introduced.These have been simple and refreshing. Do not pick players who are not fully fit. Do not pick players who are too old or too slow. Do not pick players who cannot actually pass the ball, who receive possession in the traditional state of panic, as though the ball is a terrible source of shame, the severed head tossed into your lap by some passing Colonel Kurtz to be juggled on your knee and then hurled away with a sneeze of tears.Southgate’s style demands an easy facility playing the ball out from the back. Hence the absence of Smalling this year, a fine footballer who has made the most of his talents but who was hardly renowned as a silky ball-player even in his Maidstone United days.Any marginal call at defence or goalkeeper should be decided in similar footballing fashion. Joe Hart may be a great tourist but, if he is not playing for West Ham and is poor with the ball at his feet, it is hard to see a convincing reason for picking him ahead of Nick Pope.Similarly Jack Wilshere may have a fine passing range but he lacks the strength or mobility to keep that high-tick England midfield going, a place where Southgate needs fit, powerful runners.Ruben Loftus -Cheek also has his issues with stamina. But he is a modern, powerful footballer who offers the ability to ghost past an opponent in the clinches. Similarly the athletic Alexander‑Arnold must surely go to Russia having made it to Kiev with Liverpool, where he may even play in midfield given the power of Real Madrid’s left flank.One other suggestion: Ryan Sessegnon has played a full season in a patient, technically skilled Fulham team and has further picked up the Southgate vibes in the England Under-21s. The 17‑year‑old could have been an excellent surprise pick.Beyond this there is a feeling that any kind of change is a good change. The lack of churn in successive squads has been a factor in the lassitude around England and tournament football. As it stands England’s 2018 World Cup squad could contain nine members of the Brazil 2014 lot that exited the tournament in six days and a massive 16 members of the Euro 2016 squad who exited over 90 minutes of public disintegration against Iceland in Nice, a day when England hated the ball, hated the grass, hated their own feet.Under Southgate England do at least get the point that international football is a test of systems, that it is necessary to stick to some kind of blueprint for how you want your football to look and feel rather than simply finagling together the usual odd-lot of star players and injured parts and hoping passion and pride and being England will make the difference.Southgate is limited in his choices. But he can make a statement by trimming the edges the right way, by selecting without favour and by refusing to blink at the last when his own vision of steady, high-energy passing football is finally close to the main stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5051dfdbb4dbfdb3defe3448256f6d6f0b83a8e0/0_0_4840_2905/master/4840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85ef27a4f6e7b3f1e66dab8b8765b4b4","title":"world cup stunning moments josimar charms the world at mexico 86","story":"The right-back was unknown, uncapped and unemployed before scoring two monstrous goals – but his fairytale became a cautionary taleIn the summer of 1964, England took part in the Little World Cup in Brazil. It was a simple four-team league involving Portugal, Argentina and the hosts. England finished joint-bottom with Portugal. In their first match they were plugged 5-1 by Brazil in Rio. They commiserated with a night on the town, and were staggering around Copacabana beach the following morning when they were challenged to a game by some local kids.It was an embarrassing mismatch: the England team, two years away from winning the Big World Cup, got absolutely slaughtered for the third time in 18 hours. Admittedly it was 12 v seven, and the seven had quaffed a few performance-diminishing substances the night before. But the story, told in Jimmy Greaves’s Don’t Shoot the Manager, reflects an eternal truth about Brazilian football: that there are brilliant, natural talents on every beach corner.The ultimate symbol of that is Josimar, the two-hit wonder of Mexico 86. No World Cup has ever produced a better collection of goals – if you do only one thing with your lunch break today – and Josimar scored two monsters against Northern Ireland and Poland. He might as well have come straight out of the thin Mexican air. Nobody outside Brazil had heard of him he wasn’t even in the Panini album.He wasn’t just unknown – he was also uncapped and unemployed when he was called up to the Brazil squad at the last minute after the first-choice right-back Leandro pulled out. Four players missed a curfew but only one, the playboy winger Renato Gaúcho, was thrown out of the squad by the manager Telê Santana. Leandro, whose head was a mess at the time, pulled out in a kind of guilty solidarity.Josimar had not played a game since mid-March, when his Botafogo contract expired. He was cooking and looking after his pregnant wife when he received a call telling him he was going to Mexico. In the best traditions, he thought it was a joke, politely said thank you and got on with his day. An hour later he received another call telling him where and when to report.Édson Boaro, the back-up for Leandro who was now first choice, got injured after 10 minutes of the second match against Algeria. Josimar was not on the bench but he did replace Edson in the starting line-up against Northern Ireland six days later. He was strikingly tall for a full-back and formidably built, with a sinewy frame and thighs made of oak.Brazil were 1-0 up with four minutes to go to half-time, keeping the ball with some lazy passing in Northern Ireland’s half. “Josimar … Júnior … Elzo … Alemao,” said BBC commentator John Motson, capturing the rhythmic groove of Brazil’s possession as Alemão played the ball square to Josimar. “Well, Careca and Casagrande are waiting for a cross.”They’re still waiting. Josimar pushed the ball in front of him, sprinted on the spot in excitement at what he was about to attempt, and put his whole being into a shot. It was a ridiculous distance from which to shoot - 30 yards out and a long way to the right of centre – but the ball swooshed wickedly and arrowed past Pat Jennings into the far top corner.The celebration was almost as iconic as the goal. Josimar went off on a mini lap of honour, both arms raised in the air, his face a picture of giddy disbelief. Years later, Jennings was asked by a small boy at a Q\u0026ampA what it was like to be chipped by Josimar from 35 yards. “Son,” he said. “Your idea of a chip and my idea of a chip are two different things!”For a full-back, a goal like that is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. So Josimar did it again four days later, rampaging through the Poland defence to batter the ball home from an absurd angle. It was the second goal in a 4-0 win that took Brazil into the quarter-finals, where they lost to France on penalties after a classic 1-1 draw.Even though he only played three games, Josimar was included in Fifa’s team of the tournament, the only Brazilian apart from the centre-back Júlio César to make the XI. Botafogo re-signed him, and the media adopted him. “UM HERÓI DESEMPREGADO” (THE UNEMPLOYED HERO) was the headline of a feature in Placar. He also won an informal award as the most beautiful player of the tournament. “I’m just like coffee,” he said. “The ‘blackie’ that satisfies everyone.”The fairytale soon became a cautionary tale. Josimar, like so many Brazilian footballers from poor backgrounds, was allergic to overnight fame. His life was tipped downside up and he surrendered to a hat-trick of vices: booze (especially whisky), cocaine and womanising. Soon after Mexico, he started to make different kinds of headlines. He ended up in prison after hitting a prostitute who racially abused him when he tried to negotiate a cheaper price for an orgy that had already happened. A few years later, he threw his wallet out of the window when being chased by police it was later found with three grams of coke in it. His brother, a cocaine addict, was also shot dead in a favela.Josimar was one of the first bad boys of Brazilian football, a status that rankled. “Maradona and Edmundo were given second chances,” he said in a 1995 interview. “Why not me? Nobody ever proved anything against me. I only liked a bit of whisky.”Many sportsmen never recover from their lowest point Josimar never really got over the high of Mexico and his career drifted to nothing. In 1988 he almost went to Dundee United (the mind boggles at the thought of the relationship between Josimar and Jim McLean) and he was offered to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United (the mind boggles, etc) before having a shambolic spell at Sevilla. He did play a significant part in Botafogo’s legendary Campeonato Carioca victory in 1989, and was a bit-part player in Brazil’s victorious Copa América squad a month later. He won the last of his 16 caps in November 1989. Those two goals in Mexico were the only ones he scored for Brazil.Josimar eventually found his way back on the rails with the help of the great right-back Jorginho. He embraced Christianity and now lives in the north of Brazil. He is still bitter about all the racism, the fake friends and his treatment in the press. His recent interviews suggest the internal tug-of-war between denial and regret is unresolved. He is more fondly remembered abroad than in Brazil, where he is a curiosity in the national team’s lavish history. The rest of the world only really saw Josimar at Mexico 86 and then in the greatest theatre of all, the imagination. We assumed he was roofing 30-yarders every week. If the World Cup is our dream holiday, once every four years, then Josimar was a helluva of a holiday romance. Globalisation, the internet and Football Manager have long since stripped football of its mystery. Josimar is a joyful lament for the past. His name – and what a name, by the way – evokes the innocence of ignorance, before the internet bred know-it-alls in more ways than one.There was a mythical quality to Josimar’s goals. You would see them once in a blue moon – on a grainy home-made VHS that you had lovingly labelled ‘DON’T TAPE OVER’, perhaps, or if Grandstand had a feature on great long-range goals. YouTube has changed our memories of our memories, and probably softened some of the Proustian magic of his goals. But his association is as powerful as ever.Norway’s best football magazine is called Josimar there’s even a Scottish graphic designer who named his business after his Brazilian muse. Along with Salvatore Schillaci at Italia 90, Josimar is surely football’s greatest one-tournament wonder.He is also often included in the list of lost talents. If anything he was the opposite, a good but not great player whose brief career peak was perfectly in sync with the apex of football’s four-year cycle. Brazil has millions of talented unknowns, sure – but few left a mark on the football world like Josimar.With thanks to Eduardo Pagnoncelli and David Tryhorn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad35d6a812d1d948343d1b1ef35ff10142d84c1c/152_1740_1339_803/master/1339.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b872ee40f7025ff9f9b966bf2a4ef43","title":"my childhood on the run memoir run hide repeat","story":"Pauline Dakin spent years as a fugitive. Without warning her mother would uproot the family and move. She learned it was because they were hiding from the Mafia. But years later she discovered the truthPauline Dakin was always aware her childhood was a long way from ordinary. Her parents, Warren and Ruth, separated when she was five – she knew her father had a drink problem and could be violent. Pauline, her mother and her little brother Ted moved around a lot. When Pauline was nine, her mother packed up a Volkswagen camper van in Vancouver for a holiday in Winnipeg, more than 1,000 miles away. When they got there, over a mug of cocoa, the children learned they were never going home.“That summer of 1974 was the last time I thought of my family as having any relation to normal,” writes Pauline in her memoir, Run Hide Repeat. “The events that followed made Ted and I know we were different, somehow apart. Ted would sometimes, in the years that followed, refer to ‘normal families’. Not in a critical way, but in a straightforward acknowledgment that we were not one.”Over seven years, Pauline attended six different schools. The next major relocation came when she was 13, when she was finally settled in a school she liked, had close friends and was starting to be interested in boys. This time, Ruth actually told them where they were going: all the way to New Brunswick, in the far east of Canada. Pauline and Ted were sworn to secrecy, but she broke ranks and told her best friend Wendy. When Ruth picked her up from Wendy’s house, the girls had to affect “breezy see-you-laters” so Pauline’s mother wouldn’t suspect.Ruth promised her children that one day everything would be made clear. Why they couldn’t tell anyone where they were going on holiday. Why they couldn’t even say if they were going out for dinner. Pauline heard the brush-off, “I’ll explain when you’re older,” again and again. Then, when she was 23, her mother invited her to meet her at a motel – she was ready to talk. But the explanation would be far more complicated, and more terrifying, than she could ever have dreamed.It was late February 1988, and when Pauline walked into the motel room with her mother, a man was waiting. Pauline knew him well: it was the Reverend Stan Sears, a minister with the United Church who had been part of their lives since her parents separated. Even when they moved, Sears was never far behind. So it was a surprise, but not a total shock, when they told her that they were in love. For many years, they hadn’t acted on their attraction – Sears was married, for one thing – but now they agreed they wanted to live together.A far more profound revelation was to come, however. Her mother and Sears explained that the reason the family had moved so often, so haphazardly, was that Warren, Pauline’s father, was a mobster, a key member of an organised crime syndicate in Vancouver. When they separated, Ruth had a contract put on her. Sears, meanwhile, had become implicated when he’d acted as a counsellor first to another repentant mobster, who he said had quickly been assassinated, and then to Ruth. He also had a contract put on his life.Over the weekend, Ruth and Sears filled out the details. When, out of nowhere, Pauline and Ted had been pulled from school and gone bowling, or when Ruth had emptied the entire contents of their fridge into the bin, that was because Sears had received intel that the Mafia was planning an attempt on their lives. On another occasion, the family had to scrub their feet in the bath and put plastic bags over their socks. That was, she now learned, because their carpets had been sprinkled with poison.Where did his information come from? Sears explained he had a direct connection (by a beeper he kept in his back pocket) to a shadowy government agency, who had undercover officers who collected intelligence and offered protection for people under threat from organised crime. It was a lot for Pauline to take in. A young journalist, she was working for a local newspaper and had been trained to question everything. But Sears offered intricate, compelling detail. A whole new language. The organised crime soldiers were, in his terminology, “the O” . The “Weird World” was a sort of witness-protection village, where people were secreted for their safety. Sears had moved into one, deep in the wilderness in British Columbia, and Ruth would join him. The community named it “Place of Hope” or “PH”.As much as Pauline was sceptical, these brain-scrambling stories had a twisted logic, particularly in the context of her life to that point. “As awful as the scenario might be, this explanation could mean that at least my family wasn’t just odd or crazy,” she writes. After the weekend in the motel, Pauline left with a transmitter in her car and a small transistor radio, rigged so she could call for help.This was how life went on for five years. Pauline spent a lot of time looking over her shoulder, and Sears appeared sporadically with updates. She broke up with one serious boyfriend because she didn’t dare tell him about the Weird World. When Ted got married in 1990, Sears revealed that some of the guests were actually doubles. These doppelgängers included Pauline’s aunt Penny and even her father, who she had only seen once in the previous decade. Both sides – “the good guys” and the Mafia – used doubles, Sears told her, and plastic surgery and prosthetics ensured the disguises were perfect.Doubles had a certain amount of political currency: Stalin and Hitler were famously alleged to have used decoys then there were claims in the 1990s that Manuel Noriega and Fidel Castro, the leaders of Panama and Cuba respectively, employed them. But Pauline was deeply conflicted. She stared at a small yellow naevus that her impostor father had in the cornea of his right eye and wondered how it could be replicated. Still, when Warren asked her to come to his hotel room she wriggled out of it. She believed she would be hurt or kidnapped. And her mother seemed flustered, too, becoming fixated on the toes of her sister Penny’s double. “Even if she had plastic surgery, how could they copy her bone structure?” she fretted.But despite these doubts, Pauline went deeper and deeper. She had met and married Kevin – neither her father nor his double attended the ceremony, and Sears gave her away – and told Kevin all about the Weird World. Eventually, the couple decided that they would join Ruth and Sears in Place of Hope. Preparations were so advanced that Pauline looked at a carpet sample for the cabin where they would live.Then, in 1993, aged 28, her world came crashing down for a second time. Exhausted by the ever-present fear and suspicion, and sensing that Sears’s stories weren’t quite stacking up, Pauline set up a sting. She told her mother that her house had been broken into. Ruth in turn informed Sears, and Sears came back with an involved story of how two people from the O had forced entry into her house, looking for a present from her father. Of course, the burglary never happened. In the moment after this revelation, Pauline was furious, but also bereft.“All the moves and disappearances all the running all the sick, terrifying stories all the upheaval all the isolation,” she recalls in Run Hide Repeat. “It was all because of a lie. A fucking lie. All made up. All the layered creation of the brilliant, twisted imagination of this man whom I’d chosen to love and trust as a father. I was shattered.”It’s an unseasonably sunny April morning when I catch up with Pauline on Skype. She is 53 now and has long, silvery-blonde hair and intense blue eyes Ashley Jensen’s agent should keep an eye open for the inevitable film adaptation. She sits in her light-filled kitchen in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and her dog noisily eats breakfast in the background. Much has happened in the 25 years since she began to have doubts about the Weird World. She’s had two daughters, now 21 and 19. The Reverend Stan Sears died in 2005, her mother followed in 2010.Pauline’s manner is brisk, no nonsense. When she wrote Run Hide Repeat, she feared readers would think that she and her family were fools: “I was sure people would say, ‘God, you were so naive. How could you be so gullible?’” she says. Instead, she comes across as very level-headed and sensible. For most of her professional life, she has worked as a reporter, mainly on radio and TV for the national broadcaster CBC. In later years, she has chosen to specialise in health and medical stories – facts and evidence are important to her.Since she exposed Sears’s extraordinary fraud, Pauline has had therapy, but she believes the greatest impact on her recovery has been working on her book. “Really, it’s the best thing I ever did for myself, to say: ‘Let’s go back and look at this.’”For a long time, Pauline blamed her mother: for so faithfully believing Sears for failing in her parental responsibility to protect her and Ted. Ruth could never let go of the alternative world that he created. She and Pauline eventually settled on an unspoken pact not to discuss what had happened. This held until shortly before Ruth died from ovarian cancer. Then she said: “Oh, Pauline, if you think I’m crazy for believing, how you must have hated me.”Considerable solace came when Pauline was able to put a name to what Sears was suffering from. At different points, she had considered and rejected psychosis, schizophrenia, paranoia and folie à deux, where delusional beliefs are passed from one dominating person to another more submissive one. Then, one day about four years ago, she read about a rare condition called delusional disorder. This typically comes on later in life and – unlike many other psychiatric conditions – the sufferer experiences delusions, but in many other ways behaves entirely normally. This, Pauline believes, perfectly sums up Sears, who was a well-respected, pillar- of-the-community type.“He was a very compelling guy,” she says. “He was just so intelligent, but also funny and he really connected with people. When he talked to you he really listened. You felt very heard.“In many ways, Stan was quite brilliant,” Pauline goes on. “He had an amazing mind and that allowed his delusion to become that much more complex. There was an entire cast of characters. It was like a Rolodex and he always knew who they were and the stories that were related to them. It was quite remarkable – I could not do that.”Can she forgive Sears? Pauline goes silent for a few seconds before answering. “The discovery of delusional disorder just unlocked everything for me, and allowed me some understanding of why all this crazy stuff had happened,” she says. “But also it let me realise that Stan was not malevolent, he wasn’t trying to hurt us. We just got caught up in his illness. I didn’t have to be so angry and bitter. I could move on with my life.”There has, though, clearly been considerable collateral damage from Sears’s fantastical inventions. Pauline and Kevin have orced, and she accepts that their experiences with the Weird World made their life together very difficult.“The thing I’ve realised is that having a secret isolates you from everybody,” she says. “It means you can never truly be known by somebody and there is always this barrier between you. You feel as if you are fooling people – and that doesn’t feel good.”Pauline did eventually re-establish a relationship with Warren, her father, but she never told him about the hoax that he had unwittingly been caught up in before he died. “I was afraid to tell him for his own health. And I just couldn’t see what was to be gained.”Run Hide Repeat has been a hit, especially in Canada, and Pauline insists that life is good now. There are early-stage discussions about adapting her memoir for the screen but Pauline fears her story might be turned into a schlocky soap opera.“I feel as though somebody would look at Stan and say he’s the evil bad guy without acknowledging that in many ways he played a really supportive role in my family’s life,” she says, and then pauses. “I understand the irony of that statement. And my mother was a complex and really smart person, too. I don’t want to ever see her portrayed as some wacky woman that fell for a guy.”Now, Pauline says there’s nothing she would change about her childhood. “I have a great appreciation for my mom. She caused a lot of chaos, but she really did believe she was protecting us. She was gullible to this situation but in many ways she was very wise. Right now, I’m very happy and I have these two great kids, so I can’t imagine wanting to change.” Then, a very rueful smile. “But it’s taken some work to get that point.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d4b25ba6ab6b19a13d8b96fd9d4a7fea87bd139/0_102_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99d5487829862709b6692e5f4942e758","title":"brazil xikrin catete river amazon","story":"Federal courts are battling to shut down a nickel mining plant said to be contaminating the Cateté river – a charge the company deniesThe Xikrin, who have lived alongside the Cateté river in the Amazon rainforest in northern Brazil for centuries, have a mantra: “The river is our life.” Surrounded by an abundance of plant species, they swim and bathe here.To fish, the tribe use timbó, a toxic vine that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the water, forcing the fish to come to the surface, where they are shot with arrows. “If we use hooks to fish, only one of our families will eat fish,” explains former tribal chief Onkray Xikrin. “But with timbó the whole village can eat.”But the River Cateté is dying, and with it the way of life of the Xikrin. In 2010 Mineração Onça Puma, a company owned by the mining company Vale, began extracting nickel in the nearby hills, which have tributaries flowing into the Cateté. Vale is one of the world’s largest producers of nickel.Now federal prosecutors are battling to have the operations of Mineração Onça Puma – which processes the ore at a plant less than four miles from the territory of the Xikrin – shut down. They are also seeking 50 million Brazilian reais (£10.4m) in compensation for each of the seven affected villages.The Xikrin fought for 14 years for the demarcation of their territory, a Brazilian constitutional right that protects their land from exploitation. By the time the demarcation was ratified in 1991, loggers had felled much of the mahogany in the region. Miners were also active, with high-quality iron to be found to the east, the largest copper reserves in Brazil to the north, and exceptional nickel to the west. Nearby, in 1985, Vale established what is now S11D, the largest iron ore mine in the world.Much of this took place on land that had been originally claimed by the Xikrin. But when the demarcation was ratified, 13,000 of those hectares (321,23 acres) were not included. The nickel mines in the Onça mountain range are permitted as they are not officially in the indigenous territory. But the area is home to the Xikrin cemetery, a place where the dead meet to sing and dance for eternity, according to their culture.Anthropologist Lux Vidal, emeritus professor at the University of São Paulo and a pioneer in Xikrin studies, says it was known at that time that nickel might be extracted there. “Geologists, especially Canadian geologists I met, told me: ‘This area to the west is an area designed for nickel. Nickel is the worst of things that can happen. It is the most polluting ore, the most lethal ore there can be.’”In those mountains, two streams begin that flow into the River Cateté. When it rains heavily during the Amazonian winter – between October and April – the water brings sediment and mud from the hillside, turning its waters an earthy red. One stream flows into the Cateté just 500m from the indigenous territory.When the Xikrin began to suffer headaches, skin irritations and food poisoning in 2013, it was a doctor from the university of São Paulo who told them to avoid the river.Dr João Paulo Botelho Vieira Filho first met the tribe when he went to vaccinate them to prevent their possible extinction: at that time, only 93 tribe members remained after the population had been decimated by epidemics contracted from outsiders.The doctor believed the heavy metals had caused many health problems for the Xikrin, including an unprecedented wave of births defects. “The river is dead. If nothing is done, we are on the verge of a chemical ethnocide,” he says. But many of the Xikrin continue to bathe in the river – abandoning it would mean severing ties with their history and culture.Now the fate of the mines is in the hands of Brazil’s notoriously bureaucratic court system. Federal courts have ordered the mine to cease activities on three occasions, but the enterprise continues to function after Vale obtained injunctions. The last time it was shut was in 2017, with Vale – for now – allowed to continue operating only the beneficiation part of the extraction process, which improves the economic value of the ore.Vale does not dispute that pollution exists but says it might be from farming pesticides or illegal miners nearby. In a report for investors to Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission, the firm admitted that losing the case could mean facing “a considerable financial impact” and “the cessation of operations at the Onça Puma mine”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20d0ac30d5476c1757b6f1ff92b79503275bf49/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f01b5743a6372f8989a2718f7e1911cc","title":"llamas flashmobs male bridesmaids how to have perfect modern wedding","story":"Tradition is dead, long live the personalised wedding. But do you really need to carry your pet bunny instead of a bouquet and hashtag the hell out of the big day?Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, orced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette.Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride.Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.”One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes.In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.”Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.”It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights.Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle.Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.”Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone).Any knotty family matters – orced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb1562241815b3fe99e3f50363d6960ac4cf8f0/487_1306_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d49b7055982eb4b58c9648f858553f","title":"nigel slater bresaola peas and feta recipe","story":"A fresh and sprightly piquant spring saladPut the juice of half a lemon, 6 tbsp of olive oil, 8 mint leaves and a small handful of parsley leaves into a blender, season with a little salt and process to a thick, bright green dressing.Slice a couple of medium-sized tomatoes, lay them in a single layer on a serving plate then moisten them with a spoonful of the dressing.

Not that it was always this way. When first given a used first edition with a makeshift Chinese print wrapping paper cover, I was obviously pleased and excited about cooking what were certain to be good recipes. But it didn’t seem a book to be read and relished, more the practical sort that would become a useful acquaintance. Then I did read, standing at the counter but soon finding a chair and a pencil, underlining bits so as to remember them better, my pencil doing a sort of yes, yes, YES. It is a practical book – good ones generally are – and also full of wit and wisdom from a chef who is self-taught and so possesses the spirit and mind of a home cook: a real kitchen companion.Like all the best cookbooks, it is not just the recipes that become regulars – Orvieto chicken, risotto with asparagus, cod with tzatziki – it is the methods and bits of advice that etch themselves on to cooking consciousness: that mayonnaise is best made with a whisk that onion to have with liver should be a compote, not caramelised that mise en place is key (I am working on this). There are also the ways of seeing, that oxtail is a food of reassurance and reaffirmation, that aioli is a moveable feast, the vital trivia that precedes Little’s recipe for rabbit with home-dried tomatoes: that it was a rabbit head exiting though John Hurt’s stomach in Alien.It is the advice from Keep It Simple that plays like an advert jingle when I pan-fry chicken: get it out of the fridge well in advance, season with abundant salt and pepper, rubbing well into the skin, arrange the pieces skin down in a large saute pan with a little olive oil, then fry without touching for 25 minutes until the skin is crisp and golden, before turning and cooking for another 10 minutes.Best books are also like best friends in that they know they won’t be usurped. Alastair’s chicken tips meeting a Jessica Seaton recipe was an essential collaboration Jessica’s recipe needs an oven and we don’t have one at the moment (or, rather, not one that doesn’t involve running down a flight of stairs, and across a communal garden, and back up two more flights). Having pan-fried the chicken pieces – a small (1.6kg) joined chicken or four thighslegs – you remove them from the pan, pour away most of the chicken fat, replace it with a big knob of butter and chopped shallot, and let that bubble and foam before adding half a litre or so of light chicken stock. Once the stock is simmering, you use it to poach springsummer vegetables chopped into manageable pieces and added in a (roughly) estimated order of cooking time – a big handful of sprouting broccoli first, then green beans, broad beans, then lastly peas and leaves that only need moments. Once the vegetables are cooked – tender but still vibrant (it is nice to have the vivid green) – return the chicken pieces to the pan and simmer a few minutes more.The chicken should be tender and with deep-golden skin, which contrasts with the brothy spring vegetables and beautifully flavoured broth itself. Serve with boiled potatoes, or simply with bread – con pane, the root of the word “companionship”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71bb366b5fa8b7fdd43daba3ae5353fd6dfe16a/21_0_3959_2375/master/3959.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae7d9af004f4e1f3a121bd363177b58","title":"pessimism about customs impasse after rees mogg remarks","story":"Rees-Mogg has said hard Brexiters will not back down, as subcommittee prepares to meetTheresa May’s inner Brexit cabinet is preparing to meet again, with ministers pessimistic about breaking the customs deadlock after Jacob Rees-Mogg said hard Brexit MPs would not back down.Ahead of the subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, Rees-Mogg, who heads the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, said he was not minded to take a more conciliatory position. “If we were to do so it would completely undermine the heart of why we voted to leave, rendering our almost-reclaimed sovereignty a myth,” he said.He repeated calls for Britain to walk away from the negotiations if the options May gave the European commission were rejected. “The UK will simply have to leave with no deal because the referendum result must be upheld,” he said. “Democracy is the backbone of established political societies, it fosters stability and fairness and cannot be treated so disdainfully.”Writing in the Daily , Rees-Mogg said May “ought not to take Brussels too seriously about the Irish question” when seeking a customs deal. “The commission hides behind faux concern for the Irish border undermining the single market ... We will not impose a border. If there is a deal to be done about the border it will be precisely that: a deal. Nonetheless, if one side keeps refusing to bargain, no deal will be struck.”The intervention came after May held private meetings with dozens of Conservative backbench MPs to try to explain the two options for customs arrangements with the EU. She and Rees-Mogg are reported to have clashed over the consequences for the Irish border during their meeting.The inner Brexit cabinet meets again on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the two rival plans. May still faces having to deal with a significant split among ministers over whether to back a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or opt for the “max fac” model, which would use technology to police the border.Conservative MPs were invited to five separate sessions at the Department for Exiting the European Union, where May made introductory remarks and took questions. Her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then gave a “neutral, technical” presentation of both options, with MPs given the chance to press him further on the detail afterwards. A Brexiter source said the presentation had been “neutral to the point of being incoherent”.David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said the cabinet would “test proposals to destruction” and denied the arguments were coming too late in the process. “We’ve been very focused on other aspects of Brexit, agreeing the withdrawal agreement, the implementation period. The EU themselves set a timescale to discuss these issues and it’s right that we’re focusing on it now,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We are focusing on it in a way that ensures that we get it right, that we test proposals to destruction.” Asked if that phrasing meant he agreed with Boris Johnson’s assessment that the customs partnership was “crazy”, Mundell said: “I agree with cabinet collective responsibility, we’ll look in detail at proposals that have been worked through by the sub-committees.”Before the full Brexit subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, May also faced pressure from the former John Lewis boss Andy Street, who won the West Midlands mayoralty in a surprise win over Labour last year.Street, a Tory remainer, said his region’s car industry was facing an uncertain future without a comprehensive customs deal. His remarks echo those made last week by the business secretary, Greg Clark, who favours the customs partnership option.“As the cabinet examines the different systems for administering customs after Brexit, it must ensure that whatever the final arrangements are, they sustain the manufacturing renaissance we have seen in the West Midlands,” Street wrote in the Times.He said technology would be “part of the solution” but said trade flow was crucial. “If the technology doesn’t work for car parts at Dover or Felixstowe, if there are big delays, new checks or burdensome processes to claim back customs paid, costs will go up and companies will struggle,” he said. “If we get this wrong, we will see the unintended destruction of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry in the West Midlands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/030f7ee707922cab3a4e74f0713deca1b2c2c4de/0_452_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dcda2fa3a7af6739f10adc3d802ebdb","title":"unite and momentum back rival candidates in lewisham byelection","story":"Final selection hustings to choose Labour candidate expected to be a ‘real tough battle’ for the leftUnite and Momentum are expected to back rival candidates for the battle to become Lewisham East’s next Labour MP, the  has learned.Momentum’s national coordinating group is likely to back Lewisham councillor Sakina Sheikh, a former student campaigner who has close links with the grassroots group. Unite has already formally backed Islington councillor Claudia Webbe, a member of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) and a former adviser to Ken Livingstone.A Momentum source suggested the group wanted to back a candidate with local credentials. “The local Momentum heavily backs Sakina and it feels like she will get the national backing, as they are keen to make sure it’s a local candidate with the endorsement of local members,” the source said.However, Lewisham Momentum itself is split, with a recent AGM ending in a dispute. A Facebook post on the group’s account on Tuesday shared details of a campaign phone bank for Webbe.Unite announced on Tuesday it was backing Webbe, the more experienced candidate, saying she would be “a huge asset in parliament”. The trade union said Webbe was “a lifelong socialist who tirelessly fights the corner of working people, and for justice for those let down by our political system”.Two other candidates have also been shortlisted, councillor Brenda Dacres, who stood unsuccessfully to be Lewisham mayor earlier this year, and Janet Daby, Lewisham’s deputy mayor. Lewisham East’s local party is controlled by party centrists, who are likely to organise for Daby or Dacres. A Momentum source said the seat could be “a real tough battle” for the left in the local party.The final selection hustings for the seat, which has a 21,000 Labour majority, will take place on Saturday, when party members will vote for their preferred candidate to fight the by-election in June. The process was slowed down following an email campaign by grassroots party members who felt the initial timetable was too rushed.Ian McKenzie, the chair of Lewisham East CLP, said: “I’m absolutely delighted that the NEC has listened to local members and given us a say on who is on the shortlist, so members have a genuine choice. It looks like Jeremy Corbyn’s member-led democracy actually means something.”Two of the four shortlisted candidates, Daby and Dacres, were on a list published unilaterally by the local party, but which has no formal role in drawing up the shortlist. Centrist activists in Lewisham had feared the NEC, on which Corbyn’s backers now have a majority, would only allow them to choose between candidates from the left wing of the party.The byelection was called after the resignation of Heidi Alexander, the former shadow health secretary, who quit to take up a role as deputy mayor for transport under the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at City Hall. Alexander has been co-chair of the Labour campaign for the single market.Corbyn paid tribute to her at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party in Westminster on Tuesday night. A Labour source said Corbyn had joked that he would lobby Alexander in her new role for a new bus stop in his Islington North constituency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f310a78d1f029a668ce9fcb6a33aa835e61c24/0_169_4757_2854/master/4757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f1e98ba2fb8da69699adf7aa8f771b","title":"exercise is good for you unless its part of your job","story":"Scientists find physically demanding jobs are linked to greater risk of early deathMen who work as labourers or in other physically demanding roles have a greater risk of dying early than those with more sedentary jobs, researchers say.The finding, from scientists in the Netherlands, reveals an apparent “physical activity paradox” where exercise can be harmful at work but beneficial to health when performed in leisure time.Pieter Coenen, a public health researcher at VU University medical centre in Amsterdam, said the reason for the disparity is unclear, but he believes it may reflect the different types of exercise people get at work compared with those in their free time.Other researchers say the finding may simply reflect a greater likelihood for people in manual labouring jobs to have unhealthier lifestyles in which diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all conspire to reduce life expectancy.But Coenen believes other factors are at play. “If you go out for a run for half an hour in your leisure time,” he said, “that increases your heart rate and you feel well afterwards, but when you are physically active at work, it’s a very different type of activity. You are working for eight hours a day and have limited rest periods. You are lifting, doing repetitive movements, and manual handling.“Our hypothesis is that these kinds of activities actually strain your cardiovascular system rather than help you to improve the fitness of your cardiovascular system.”International public health guidelines encourage people to spend half an hour a day on moderate to intense physical activity to keep healthy, but previous research has shown that those who work in construction and other physically demanding jobs are the least likely to exercise in their leisure time. “They are in double trouble,” said Coenen. “They don’t benefit from the good aspects of leisure-time activity, and they are exposed to the risk of occupational physical activity.”To investigate the effects of exercise on health, the scientists combined the results from 17 published studies, giving them data on nearly 200,000 people. Most of the studies they included took lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, into account, but Coenen concedes that not all of the studies completely ruled out their harmful effects.In light of the findings, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Coenen believes more should be done to encourage people in manual work to follow the standard guidelines on exercise, and not be fooled into thinking that they got enough at work. “Even if you are physically active at work, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to be physically active in your leisure time,” he said.Mark Hamer, who studies exercise as medicine at Loughborough University, believes the findings can be explained by manual and office workers having very different lifestyles. He points to a study last year of half a million people in China that found physical activity had health benefits whether it was at work or in leisure time.“The message I would give is that people should try to follow the physical activity guidelines regardless of what they do for a job,” Hamer said. “And people should be thinking about their lifestyles more generally, because that is likely to be at the root of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/998792f0055469fd256f43f0d37730c7ae3e4e01/142_282_2858_1715/master/2858.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=538e91097c6ed8687ef4e3d6f241c953","title":"what county cricket can expect from big dog virat kohlis arrival","story":"Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes give their first-hand experience of playing alongside India’s biggest starThe last time an incumbent captain of India joined an English county side was in 2000, when Sourav Ganguly pitched up at Lancashire. The story goes that early on, such was their overseas signing’s attitude that he handed his batting partner, one Mike Atherton, his sweater during a break in play with orders to run it back to the dressing room.It’s a great line but, sadly, one that is apocryphal, or has at least been spun to such an extent that Muttiah Muralitharan would have been be proud. Atherton did briefly find himself holding said cable-knit while his team-mate made a sartorial adjustment but apparently no such instruction was given.Nevertheless, that such an embellishment followed is still symptomatic of Ganguly’s time at Old Trafford as a man apart. Andrew Flintoff said it was like having “Prince Charles” in the team, such was his regal demeanour. Ian Austin lamented the fact he “made no attempt to join in socially” and did not truly deliver with the bat after turning up believing “county cricket would be a doddle”.Others simply described a cricketer who was a little reserved – hardly a first – and worked his hours. Ganguly himself has since explained that long playing days meant drinking after stumps was not his thing, not least since his wife, Dona, was with him in Manchester and did not know many people. The Ganguly-Lancashire mismatch came to mind when The Spin began pondering the impending arrival of Virat Kohli at Surrey for his mutually beneficial month-long spell in June. The India captain, desperate to avoid a repeat of a 2014 horror show that yielded 138 runs in 10 innings against England, can adjust to conditions before the Tests in August, while the club and the County Championship will be swamped by an avalanche of stardust.Beyond the inevitable grumbles about English cricket pointing the blunderbuss to the foot of its own national team, what can his new team-mates expect from Kohli? Will he be rocking up and throwing his bats to Rikki Clarke for extra linseed oil, or ordering Sam Curran to fetch him 1,000 brown M\u0026ampMs to fill a brandy glass as a pre-condition of taking the field? After all, this is a cricketer with a combined social-media following of 83 million people, estimated annual earnings of £20m (thanks to deals with Puma, Tissot, Audi and Pepsi) and is one half of India’s leading power couple following his marriage to Bollywood’s Anuskha Sharma. Surrey have long had a reputation as the south London strutters who love a big-name signing, but Kohli surely tops the lot.To this end, The Spin enquired as to what is in store for the dressing room in SE11 by asking Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two upstanding Brummies who have spent the past six weeks playing under Kohli for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, for something of a character reference.“I know a few of the Surrey guys and they are not what people make them out to be a lot of the time. But if anyone in that dressing room does think they are a big dog, they will need to sit down for a little while because there is a proper big dog coming,” says Moeen with tongue is slightly in cheek.“You have your perceptions of someone like Virat, who is quite passionate, emotional, in your face and plays it hard,” explains Woakes. “But off the field he’s very calm and you can chat about anything. He’s very down to earth and for someone who has such huge pressures and public focus in India, to see him go about his business in this way quite refreshing.”Moeen adds: “You see him on the field and people might think he’s arrogant but it is the complete opposite. He’s so humble it is almost weird how nice he is. He’s the biggest name in India but will ring me to check I’m OK or ask if I fancy lunch. Sometimes a player will invite the squad to their house for a meal and it would be easy for him to say no. But he would always go. I can say with certainty that anyone who has a bad word doesn’t know the guy.”Though Kohli’s presence in county cricket will doubtless draw huge focus – no bad thing at a time when the English game is finally trying to break down barriers to entry for the South Asian community – it will still be a step down in intensity from the hothouse of India. Indeed AB de Villiers, another RCB team-mate, told The Spin he expects the 29-year-old to one day finish his career in England for this reason.Says Woakes: “In my first year of IPL I found as an overseas player you get a lot of attention walking through airports in India. But having him in the team – the No 1, the king – we’re almost irrelevant. It makes you realise what his life is like. So county cricket will be much more chilled and he’ll enjoy that. Playing at smaller grounds, that will be an experience too. Having spoken to him about it, he loves touring other countries – it’s a release.”When Surrey confirmed the deal, director of cricket Alec Stewart said one of the main benefits will be watching his off-field preparation – not least his dedication to fitness – with Woakes giving a glimpse of just what this means.“Around 30 minutes before the bus leaves for a match, he does what he calls a ‘priming session’ in the gym,” he says. “It’s like a short burst of Olympic weightlifting. It’s certainly different but it works for him. Overall, his fitness work is having a serious impact on the next generation of Indian players. He’s leaner, fitter, more agile than those before.” For Moeen, however, Kohli’s overriding impact on Surrey will probably be his drive: “When he crosses the line he just wants to win. But it’s winning with control, not win at all costs. They will see his passion for the game. It is unbelievable. “And the fact he’s coming in a day and age when people are trying to play as much T20 as they can, that sums him up – he’s just dedicated to improvement. The England series is big for him personally and he’s giving himself the best chance to succeed.”The latter point may leave some frustrated and the fact it means missing Afghanistan’s inaugural Test in India will irk others. But there is little question that county cricket is going to get an almighty jolt when Kohli arrives next month, not least to any “big dogs” in south London.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Leinster’s European Champions Cup victory in Bilbao should logically have represented a high-profile full stop but for many it is not yet the end of the season – far from it. The Premiership and Pro14 have yet to play their semi-finals, the Top 14 final in France is not until 2 June and this summer’s hectic international tour schedule would cause even a travel agent’s head to spin.Talk to the Champions Cup organisers and they freely admit they would prefer their tournament to mirror football’s Champions League final: a natural conclusion to the season for every club in Europe. As things stand Leinster have just won the ultimate prize but, as with Saracens last year, now have to prove themselves all over again. It is a bit like hosting a royal wedding and then arranging the stag night on the subsequent weekend.Leaving aside the significant element of roulette it lends to the domestic play-offs – if Munster are not fresher than a battered Leinster this Saturday it will be a miracle – it also has an effect which, left unchecked, threatens the future growth of the entire sport. Undercutting one’s best product by shunting it into a slot in the calendar that dilutes its impact is not what is taught at business school.It is part of a wider issue: professional club rugby’s curious inability to sell itself better. The past weekend in northern Spain was a fine example of what can happen when the net is thrown a little wider. In addition to blue-clad Irish and Welsh supporters following their own teams, the people of Bilbao and San Sebastián found themselves welcoming everyone from French fans dressed in chicken outfits to a bunch of old farts from Edinburgh University on a reunion weekend. Give or take some of the more excessive hotel prices and travel disruption, spreading the rugby gospel to Spain clearly caught the imagination.Hopefully it will be the same in Newcastle next year: taking the finals somewhere outside the normal roster of Six Nations venues – Amsterdam, Milan or Munich in 2020, anyone? – may necessitate an extra financial cost but tends to be repaid many times over by the added exposure it brings the sport in places that may otherwise take little notice.Despite faithful sponsors such as Heineken and Turkish Airlines, there continues to be a sense that club rugby, as a product, should be bigger than it is. For all the fine work done by Sky Sports in covering European rugby over the past two decades – they have been edged out entirely by BT Sport for next season’s tournament – how many of Leinster’s champion XV apart from Johnny Sexton would stand a chance of being identified by the public if they strolled down a busy London street?It would be a similar story for many of England’s supposedly best‑known current players. Maybe it is time to sit down with every press officer in Britain and Ireland and, not for the first time, advise them that clubs or coaches who restrict team members from talking to the media or teach them to converse only in mind-numbing robot speak do the players and the game a major disservice. Loosening the PR shackles may even help them perform better: the inidual better able to express himself off the field will surely develop into a more mature, confident presence on it.Instead of clinging to the tried and tested, why not take a risk or two? In Australia something genuinely interesting is happening: the World Series Rugby concept invented by the billionaire West Force owner, Andrew Forrest, is attracting crowds significantly in excess of Super Rugby attendances.For the second weekend in a row the exiled Western Force drew the biggest crowd in Australia, with 16,323 fans watching them beat a Tongan representative side compared with the 5,283 who watched the Brumbies against the Melbourne Rebels in Canberra. Forrest’s stated mission is to make rugby a more exciting day out and the early signs would suggest he could be on to something.With the English domestic season set to run into mid-June in future and the Test window due to shift to July, the status quo will shortly be challenged here as well. Sooner rather than later the desire for more South African teams to play in Europe will intensify to the point where it becomes a financial no-brainer. A Champions Cup final involving the Stormers or the Sharks? It might be closer than people think.As with cricket and golf, it is all part of a wider discussion rugby union should be having with itself. Sporting tastes are changing fast and what happened last year can no longer be tomorrow’s blueprint. The calendar is a vital component but so is calculated innovation. Maybe next season’s replacement for the defunct Anglo-Welsh Cup should be played under different regulations: less kicking permitted, a countdown clock for set pieces, rolling subs or fewer players, an extra on-field official to enforce the offside line properly? Or maybe not. What really matters is recognising the obvious: the traditional northern hemisphere season is too long, frustratingly structured and increasingly ripe for change.Confirmation that Danny Cipriani and James Haskell are flying the Wasps’ nest to play for Gloucester and Northampton respectively next season provokes one obvious question: which of the three clubs concerned has done the best piece of business? Their respective league positions next season will provide the ultimate measure but Cipriani’s move to Kingsholm feels like a good move for the player. If the fly-half can light up the Cotswolds and earn the Shed’s instant respect, he will discover there are few more satisfying places in Britain to play rugby.On the subject of Cipriani, this Saturday’s Premiership semi-final between Saracens and Wasps offers a tantalising head-to-head between England’s prodigal No 10 and Owen Farrell, set to lead his country in South Africa next month. Different in style but now with identical goals, this is Cipriani’s chance to show definitively that he can shape major games against top opposition. If Wasps are given the freedom to attack as they can do, it could be the livelier of the two big sporting contests being staged in north London this Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"funny cow maxine peake rhona cameron rachel fairburn shappi khorsandi","story":"Rhona Cameron, Rachel Fairburn and Shappi Khorsandi give their verdict on the film in which Peake plays an aspiring comic in a man’s worldFor a long time I felt – like Maxine Peake’s character – that life was easier on stage than off. Funny Cow left me pissed off because I wanted to write that film! But I was moved, too, because so much of its emotional core resonated with me. I couldn’t leave my seat for a while because I was so upset. I felt relieved that someone was finally talking about the seriousness of comedy, through the journey of a working-class female standup.I don’t identify as a “woman comic” or indeed a “woman”. I am Rhona. I’ve always been very non-binary gender in my thinking, feeling and actions. But I did notice, as a younger comic, that an unknown male could go on stage and he’d be given a chance. He was allowed to take his time, to indulge, even. But if you were a woman, you had to be “bang, bang, bang, bang” right away, no breaths. So I thought the scene in the club where she demolishes a fat, drunken, thick guy was very powerful.There’s one line that will stay with me: “It’s fuck all to do with being funny, it’s to do with surviving.” That is so true. A comedian is part-gladiator, part-psychologist, part-preacher, part-actor, part-self-harmer, part-poet, part-clown. If you’re screwed up from life and go out on to this risky tightrope of adulation or hatred – running this extreme gauntlet every night – and then go back to this desolation of self, it takes its toll. That’s what makes comedy the mothership of the arts. It’s so fucking dangerous.It’s every northern cliche rolled into one. The performances are brilliant, but I felt that a lot of the film was stereotypical. You have a female character from the north of England, and it’s like: “Of course she’s northern, she’s beaten by her husband. Of course she’s northern, her dad was an alcoholic.” I’ve never written a film, and I hate slating other people’s work, but I just found it a bit empty.You don’t really see any of the reasons why Peake’s character would want to become a standup. She makes two funny comments as a child – using humour as a defence – but doesn’t come across as particularly witty. I suppose, as a kid, she was an outsider and a bit of a showoff. That was relatable: when I was a kid, I was either showing off or I was really quiet, and I always had a side of me that wanted to perform. But it wasn’t clear why she would have wanted to be a standup, other than suddenly going to a comedy night and enjoying one person’s set. I get fed up of the idea that people do standup because they’ve had a hard time when they were young or that they must be sad really, which the film suggests. It’s not true. There are lots of different reasons why people start performing comedy. This could have been an opportunity to have a female standup character who wrote her own material and was different, and that’s why she is funny. But she just goes on stage and does the exact same jokes that a bloke had done. The older comic, Lenny (played by Alun Armstrong), says to her: “It’s not a job for women women aren’t funny.” She sort of proves his point by then doing his jokes.In one scene, Peake goes on stage and can’t speak, and the audience starts heckling. I’ve never frozen like that, but what made it powerful to watch, as a comic, was knowing how badly she wants it, and then seeing her sabotaged by her own nerves. It’s the personification of every bad gig, every bad feeling that you have when you die on stage. They got that bit beautifully, and that made me feel so proud of all that I’ve been through as a professional comic. I thought: “Yes, babe – being a female comic, I get that.”But Funny Cow is not a film about standup comedy. It’s not a film about a woman making her way in the comedy world. It’s a film about child abuse. In the first few minutes, a child gets brutally, viciously attacked with a chain belt. It wrecked my head, to the point where I got into a fight with a man in the audience who was being rude to some women. It’s not a subtle film about the delicate soul of a standup it’s about a spirited child being broken by her parents. She could have decided that, in order to get out of her head, she wanted to be a cartoonist or a landscape gardener. It doesn’t get into the nitty-gritty of being a comedian. I didn’t find anything nuanced about it. There’s a scene where Paddy Considine’s character, a bookshop owner, takes her out to dinner. They do this whole Educating Rita thing, and he says to her: “Who took away your self-esteem?” It’s like: “I see, what happens is comedians don’t have self-esteem – got it!” It didn’t leave much to the imagination.But what made the film, for me, were the spectacular performances. Kevin Eldon’s brilliant turn, John Bishop’s gorgeous cameo. And I could not take my eyes off Peake. She’s an utter superstar, and I now want to see everything she does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f64871cf074cbe16b5c67aec7ebd86983c5b01/0_579_1887_1131/master/1887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2168738c1f84ed8f1f581d08e3ce433b","title":"jetpacks jet propulsion flying to work","story":"It’s not as if the tech hasn’t shown promise, but jet propulsion has never become part of our daily lives. Here’s whyThose of a certain age may remember the opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. As Rafer Johnson lit the eternal flame, a man strapped into a rocket-propelled backpack launched himself across the arena above the ticker tape and balloons, landing gracefully on the track before a TV audience of 2.5 billion.It was a moment of triumph seeming to herald a new age in which, finally, teased for decades by Buck Rogers’ “degravity belt” and King of the Rocketmen, we’d all soon be fizzing off to work with our own personal jetpacks. Even Isaac Asimov confidently predicted that by the turn of the century, they would be “as common as a bicycle”.So what happened? In 2018, shouldn’t we all be flying to work? So called “rocketmen” were not entirely the work of fiction. Russian pilot Aleksandr Andreyev had been working on one as early as 1919. Germany’s second world war rocket whiz Wernher Von Braun allegedly worked on a “jet vest” for the US army after the war, which later became project Grasshopper, aiming to build a “jump belt”.All these attempts fizzled out due to lack of funds. It wasn’t until engineer Wendell Moore’s Bell Rocket Belt was first tested in 1960 that the world witnessed a working jetpack – using a turbo jet rather than a rocket. The US military commissioned Moore and John K Hulbert – a gas turbine specialist – to work on the Jet Belt, or “man rocket”, for possible military use. Moore’s first problem was fuel – anything capable of producing enough thrust burned up in a flash. Moore hit upon using hydrogen peroxide, a compound commonly used as bleach, as a fuel. Two cylinders were attached to a fibreglass frame with another of nitrogen gas. Forced on to a catalyst, this mix explodes into superheated steam, shooting through twin nozzles at 700C.Thrust sorted, they soon encountered the human body’s natural resistance to aerial navigation. The device, which used directional thrusters controlled by hand-operated levers, was extremely tricky to stabilise.Undaunted, Moore flew the first flights himself, but in February 1961 the belt swerved like an unattended firehose, snapped its tether and Moore fell 2.5 metres, breaking his kneecap. After 36 tethered flights in a hangar, the untethered belt was finally flown outside by Harold “Hal” Graham, a 27-year-old Bell test engineer with no previous flight experience. Amid a cacophony of steam, Graham flew for just 13 seconds, covering over 34 metres (112 feet) at an altitude of 18 inches. During the first public display at Fort Eustis, Virginia, on 8 June 1961, Graham lifted himself to around 4.5 metres, dangled around for 15 seconds and landed, offering a salute.It was a big hit with the public. Graham piloted the device all around the world to great acclaim, but after landing on his head from 6.7 metres at a demo in Florida, he retired. Graham handed over the reins to his friend Bill Suitor, who proved adept at flying the machine. Again, the public loved it, but the US army, who was paying for it, was disappointed. The belt weighed 56.7kg with fuel and consumed 19 litres of expensive hydrogen peroxide during its 30 second flight and required a platoon of service personnel to attend to it. It flew neither high nor low enough to be at a safe height, and it was difficult to fly. In the opinion of the military, the Bell Rocket Belt was more a spectacular toy than an effective means of transport, so it withdrew funding.But by then the idea had caught on. Jetpack enthusiast and engineer Nelson Tyler, approached Suitor with his own belt. Suitor flew the Tyler belt to much acclaim at exhibitions across the US, culminating in the triumphant flight at the Olympics in 1984. Stunt pilot Kinnie Gibson was next to fly Tyler’s belt, making himself a millionaire flying as the Rocketman until his passing – from natural causes – in 2015. But it was Gibson’s success that is partly why you haven’t come to work on a rocket pack this morning. Then, in 1992, came the RB2000, a project based on the Bell model, built by Brad Barker, Larry Stanley and Joe Wright. If ever there was a moral reason not to build a rocket belt, this story told in The Rocketbelt Caper by Paul Brown – involving lump hammers, lawsuits, drug smuggling and murder – is it.Fast-forward to the 2010s and jetpacks have become a reality again, if not quite in the form of the personal backpack we thought we would all be dangling from. Water-propelled HydroliftJetlev devices have become a commonplace exotic seaside pursuit, while jetpack enthusiasts build untethered versions for themselves, usually similar to the designs of Wendell Moore at Bell. The big difficulty here is still the scarcity of hydrogen peroxide. Inventor, tech whiz and head of Google’s research laboratory Google X, Astro Teller, says even Google has looked into jetpacks, but at a quarter-mile a gallon and with a motor as loud as a Harley Davidson, decided they weren’t practical.More hopeful is the offering from Jetpack Aviation, who specialise in personal vertical takeoff and landing devices. It demoed its JB10 in Monaco (two minutes aloft) and in London in October (four minutes aloft) last year to some acclaim. The brain power behind it? One Nelson Tyler, who aims to release an electric version in 2019 … yours for £200k.Then there’s Swiss ex-military and commercial pilot Yves “JetMan” Rossy, who straps two 8ft carbon wings and four small kerosene jet engines to his body. Online footage shows Rossy confidently executing loop-the-loops and roaring over the Grand Canyon strapped into his device. Drawback: one must throw oneself out of a plane, which makes for a rather awkward commute. Cost: £190k.Richard Browning, meanwhile, is a British inventor dubbed “Wiltshire’s Iron Man”, whose Daedalus personal flightsuit sees him strap jet engines to his back and hands.Perhaps the most promising development, which is already on the market, is that made by Tecnologia Aeroespacial Mexicana. It’s already sold four of its Tecaeromex Rocket Belts, and a helicopter version is in the works. You can even train to use one using a JetLev. We might soon be able to fly about strapped into jetpacks, but whether we should is another matter. It’s hard to disagree with original rocketman Suitor, who said, after his experiences with Barker and co: “I hope they never become popular. Nobody would be safe.“You’d have people falling out of the air like unwanted Santa Clauses. I’ve had several close shaves myself and almost sliced myself up like a big soft slice of silky cheese. Could you imagine every idiot who could afford one flying about?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/275b2f8fdbad5de34f52278426cbe0c53f1d784d/533_685_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a5eb90b1954828cd6c8f8bf6a32242","title":"behind scenes baftas 2018 in pictures","story":"Photographer Sarah Lee joins the stars backstage at the Royal Festival Hall, London, for the Virgin TV British Academy Television Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b3699f00e390a1cc689ae29a1cfb9ad7de01ea/0_187_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41939b8968825d19793cdc4e8e8c6499","title":"rightwing thinktanks secret plot against unions","story":"Internal documents obtained by the  reveal a nationwide drive to persuade union members to quit and stop paying duesRightwing activists are launching a nationwide drive to persuade public sector trade union members to tear up their membership cards and stop paying dues, posing a direct threat to the progressive movement in America.Documents obtained by the  reveal that a network of radical conservative thinktanks ning all 50 states is planning direct marketing campaigns targeted personally at union members to encourage them to quit. The secret push, the group hopes, could cost unions up to a fifth of their 7 million members, lead to the loss of millions of dollars in income and undermine a cornerstone of US progressive politics.The anti-union marketing drive is the brainchild of the State Policy Network (SPN), a coast-to-coast alliance of 66 rightwing thinktanks that has an $80m war chest to promote Donald Trump-friendly regressive policies such as low taxes and small government. The group is funded by such billionaire conservative donors as the Koch brothers and the Walton Family Foundation that stems from the Walmart fortune. Previous SPN literature exposed by the  has revealed the political motives behind the network’s attacks on unions. It aims to “defund and defang” public sector unions as a means to “reverse the failed policies of the American left”. The goal, the group said, was “permanently depriving the left from access to millions of dollars in dues extracted from unwilling union members every election cycle”.  has now obtained what SPN is calling a “toolkit” of advice to its followers on how to go about fomenting “union reform” – a euphemism for draining unions of members and cash. The “toolkit” sets out four “tactics” for depleting their power – “effective union reform” in its language. One of those tactics is the opt-out campaign.“To get employees to opt-out of their union,” the “toolkit” says, “they first need to know they have a choice. A direct marketing campaign to union represented public employees that combines mail and digital outreach helps raise awareness and raise opt-out rates.”The SPN blueprint sets out how to acquire the private details of union members through state freedom of information laws so that opt-out propaganda can be targeted directly at them. It says: “Access to lists of union members is essential to this project. The most common means of obtaining lists is through requests made under state public records laws.”The toolkit is being circulated at a vital moment for public sector trade unions. The wave of school teachers’ strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and elsewhere has reinvigorated the labor movement as a key part of the resistance to stagnating wages, waning resources and a hostile White House.More perilously, the US supreme court is poised to deliver its ruling any day in Janus v AFSCME, one of the most important trade union cases in recent times. If the five conservative justices on the highest court vote in favor of the anti-union plaintiff, as many expect, they would deal a severe blow to organized labor by giving employees the right to opt-out of paying their share of the costs of collective bargaining even though they benefit from negotiated higher wages and improved conditions.That in turn would give the green light to conservative groups like SPN to step up their efforts to encourage mass resignations of union members. As a clear statement of intent, SPN invited Mark Janus, a child support worker in Illinois who is the named plaintiff at the center of the supreme court case, to speak at its annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, last August.Carrie Conko, SPN’s vice president of communications, said that “workers should be able to decide for themselves if payment of union dues and fees is a good use of their hard-earned money or if their money is better spent elsewhere”. SPN’s aim was not political, rather it was “simply about protecting free speech”. Public-sector unions had created a problem for themselves, Conko said, by leaving some workers to feel they were being used. The Janus case might actually help government unions improve their standing with members as “they will need to prove their worth by providing better representation to earn the voluntary dues”.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the  documents revealed the extent of secret planning by right-wing groups ahead of the supreme court’s Janus ruling. “These documents make clear that Janus v AFSCME is not a case brought by iniduals trying to have a voice, it’s a case brought by wealthy forces to eliminate worker voice and power.”She added that rightwing billionaires such as the Kochs “know working families only have power through their unity as a union, and they will stop at nothing to destroy that. But we have seen unprecedented support for our unions and the opportunities they enable for a better life – when the Janus decision day comes, we will stand united, ready to act and fight back against the forces that want to silence workers.”One of the SPN thinktanks, the Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington state, has already begun campaigning and fundraising on the back of a Janus ruling that goes against the unions. It has been mailing out to supporters in which it says “we are gearing up in a major way to launch an extensive education and activation campaign to take full advantage of a favorable ruling in this historic case”.The foundation goes on to say: “The consequences of a favorable ruling are huge. Imagine tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars currently used to push damaging leftwing causes and candidates … vanishing.”In 2016 the Freedom Foundation ran a brazen campaign in Washington and Oregon in which it went knocking on the doors of more than 10,000 childcare and home care workers telling them that under a previous US supreme court ruling they could opt out of paying union dues. In the document obtained by the , SPN boasts that the foundation’s operation cost the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in those states $8.8m in lost dues and legal fees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c6fdef8a98d5e7b7b9416228d54e2e167bd9c9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c493d8b73817e09fdf1b79e375fc41","title":"airline pilot sucked halfway out when cockpit windshield broke","story":"Sichuan Airlines co-pilot was pulled back inside by crew after right windshield blew out at 32,000 feetThe co-pilot of a Sichuan Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing on Monday was “sucked halfway out” of the plane when a cockpit windshield blew out, local media reported citing the aircraft’s captain. Captain Liu Chuanjian – hailed as a hero on social media after having to land the Airbus A319 manually – told the Chengdu Economic Daily his aircraft had just reached a cruising altitude of 32,000ft when a deafening sound tore through the cockpit. There was a sudden loss of pressure and drop in temperature. When he looked over, the right windshield was gone. “There was no warning sign. Suddenly the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I know my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window,” he was quoted as saying. “Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned ... and I couldn’t hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.”The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back in. He sustained scratches and a sprained wrist, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said, adding that one other cabin crew member was injured in the descent. None of the plane’s 119 passengers were hurt. An investigation is under way. The flight, Sichuan Airlines 3U8633, left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday morning and was bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. It made its emergency landing in the south-west city of Chengdu. “The crew were serving us breakfast when the aircraft began to shake,” an unnamed passenger told the government-run China News Service. “We didn’t know what was going on and we panicked. Then the oxygen masks dropped … We experienced a few seconds of free fall before it stabilised again. “I’m still nervous. I don’t dare to take an airplane anymore. But I’m also happy I had a narrow escape.” The windshield shattered about half an hour after the plane took off at 6.25am local time, the Chengdu Economic Daily said. A separate report said the aircraft had accumulated 19,912 flight hours since entering service at Sichuan Airlines in July 2011.Birds or lightning strikes have been known to crack airliners’ windshields before but an entire windshield coming off is rare. In 1990 one of the pilots on British Airways flight 5390 was sucked partially out of the cabin window after its windshield blew out at 23,000 feet.

Kim pledged to close the complex after his historic meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, saying North Korea no longer needed the site. There were reports the site had collapsed and was unusable, but Kim himself reportedly dismissed those claims, saying “we have two more tunnels that are bigger than the existing ones and that they are in good condition”. North Korea has said it will dismantle its nuclear bomb test site later this month in order to uphold its pledge to cease tests.The two countries will hold high-level talks on Wednesday to discuss steps needed to uphold the pledge to denuclearise the Korean peninsula and formally end the Korean War.The new images show key buildings and several smaller sheds have been torn down and a rail line connecting one of the entrances had been removed. Excavation of a new tunnel appears to have stopped in March.“This activity along with the rail removal could be further evidence of an operational shut down,” according to 38 North.North Korea’s plan to close the site has been welcomed by Washington, Seoul and the UN secretary general. “I would imagine that the plan is to sanitize the site to remove any sensitive information about the state of North Korea’s nuclear weapons development, then invite in the journalists and experts to confirm that, yes, the site is now a ghost-town,” Jeffrey Lewis and David Schmerler, both arms control experts, wrote in a separate blog post analysis satellite imagery.North Korea’s foreign ministry has said it will invite foreign journalist to witness the decommissioning of the site at Punggye-ri. One new structure could be a camera position to record the closure of the West Portal, 38 North said.“Dismantlement of the nuclear test ground will be done in the following sequence-making all tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion completely blocking entries removing all observation facilities, research institutes and structures of guard units on the ground,” the ministry said in a statement released through the state run Korean Central News Agency.Dialogue brokered by South Korea has seen US-North Korea relations go from trading personal insults and threats of war last year to a summit between Kim and Trump which will be held in Singapore on 12 June.Washington is seeking the “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” of the North and stresses that verification will be key.But sceptics warn that Pyongyang has yet to make any public commitment to give up its arsenal, which includes missiles capable of reaching the United States."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf2df15db1a2f8423957ef653fcd878a66aee218/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccebd526b54705c82570901e1e22cd6c","title":"iraq shock election result may be turning point for iran","story":"Result is blow to US, but Iran will also lose out after Iraq’s protest against rule by proxyThe unexpectedly poor showing of Haider al-Abadi, Iraq’s prime minister, in parliamentary elections has dealt a blow to US influence in the country. It was a poor return for American backing for the Baghdad government’s drive to extirpate Islamic State and regain lost territory.But the bigger loser may be Iran, whose allies in Iraq’s Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces were pushed into second place by Moqtada al-Sadr, the veteran nationalist. Put simply, Sadr believes Iraqis should run Iraqi affairs – not Washington, not Tehran and not their proxies.The pressing question now, for Iraqis and the wider Arab world, is whether the election marks the high watermark of Iranian influence that has grown steadily across the region since the 2003 US invasion. Recent events have blown large holes in the prevailing narrative of an inexorable Iranian advance. In short, have we reached “peak Iran”? Evidence the tide may be turning emerged last week after Donald Trump, in effect, tore up the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sweeping sanctions.Tehran’s fractured leadership seemed caught off-guard by the full force of the US president’s denunciation. It has failed so far to articulate a clear response.Although European signatories will this week tell Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, they are determined to uphold the pact, this seems an empty promise. Faced with swingeing US treasury sanctions, private companies doing business in Iran will mostly walk away. There is little France, Germany or the EU can do to stop them.By its relative silence, the UK – caught as ever between Washington and Europe – is already acknowledging this reality. Nor can Iran rely on Russia or China, also signatories to the deal, to bail it out. To fund its inefficient state-dominated economy, its ongoing interventions in Syria and Yemen and, for example, its ballistic missile programme, Iran needs the billions of dollars accruing from oil exports. This cash flow is in serious jeopardy.Iran had a significant setback in another regional theatre last week, blundering into an Israeli trap. It began with a minor attack last Tuesday on Iranian military facilities at Kisweh, south of Damascus – the latest of several Israeli hit-and-run raids to which Iran had not until then responded. It proved the last straw.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards commanders opened fire on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights. That gave Israel a looked-for pretext to launch a pre-planned assault on Iranian facilities all across Syria. It was a classic sucker punch. Iran’s troublesome military buildup appears to have been halted, at least for now. Iran, meanwhile, risks being outmanoeuvred diplomatically. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, was in Moscow again last week, aligning his interests in Syria with those of Vladimir Putin. Israel forewarned Russia of last week’s attacks.Such coordination is becoming routine. Viewed from Tehran, Russia, ostensibly Iran’s brother-in-arms in Syria, is increasingly unreliable. Its Saudi foes are greatly encouraged by Trump’s offensive.Iran’s regional leadership pretensions are also under challenge on religious and ideological grounds. Just as many Iraqi voters resent Tehran’s domineering, neocolonial behaviour, Shias around the region appear to be looking again to Najaf, the historical capital of Shiadom, rather than to Qom, the Iranian holy city that usurped its role during Saddam Hussein’s Sunni dictatorship. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most senior Shia cleric in Iraq, is spiritual grist to Sadr’s nonsectarian mill. In rejecting the Velayat-e faqih, the guiding principle established by Iran’s late Ayatollah Khomeini, Sistani has also rejected the fundamental precept that the “trustworthy jurist” (that is to say, Iran’s supreme leader) has absolute power over the body politic as well as the community of the faithful. Sistani’s authoritative drawing of a line (in western terms) between church and state has appeal inside Iran, too, where domestic unrest this year focused on economic woes but also on the overweening, illiberal power of a corrupt theocracy. Iraq’s mini-rebellion against rule by Iranian proxy may yet prove a turning point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bebbc41483d62ad128d77f7f602c30cd4c3132d3/199_46_1552_931/master/1552.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e052de32061d3ab9883b4b20cf27bcfc","title":"uk government block release files gaddafi libya abdel hakim belhaj","story":"Lawyers to call for FoI request to be rejected days after apology for Abdel Hakim Belhaj renditionGovernment lawyers are attempting to prevent documents that detail the relationship between the British government and Muammar Gaddafi from being made public under the Freedom of Information Act, just days after apologising for the UK’s role in the kidnap and torture of one of the Libyan dictator’s opponents.They are appealing against an information tribunal ruling that the documents should be handed to Nigel Ashton, professor of international history at the London School of Economics.At a hearing in London on Wednesday, lawyers for the Cabinet Office will argue that Ashton’s request should be dismissed as being “vexatious” because of the amount of time it would take to redact the papers before release, on such grounds as national security and the safeguarding of international relations.At a hearing last year, the information tribunal ruled that Ashton had made a request for “information which is of great public value and significance”, and that as a consequence the clause in the act that deals with vexatious requests – those that are manifestly unjustified – could not be invoked.Ashton initially requested copies of Downing Street files that covered the period from the Lockerbie bombing of December 1988 to the revolution of 2011 that resulted in Gaddafi being deposed and murdered. He subsequently narrowed his request to files from the years 1990 to 2002, but has said he may request more.Last week Theresa May told Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the leader of an Islamist militia that had been opposed to Gaddafi, and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, that she was “profoundly sorry” about the role MI6 played in their kidnap, rendition and torture in 2004. The government paid Boudchar £500,000. Throughout his six-year legal battle, Behaj insisted he wanted only an apology, and he received no payment. In return, the couple dropped their civil claim against MI6 and the Foreign Office, and against Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, who were foreign secretary and head of counter-terrorism at MI6 at the time of the couple’s kidnap. The couple’s lawyers also withdrew their attempt to seek a judicial review of the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision not to charge Allen with criminal offences after a four-year Scotland Yard investigation.The couple had been taken off a flight in Bangkok and detained by the CIA after a tipoff from MI6. They were put on a flight to Tripoli, where Belhaj was imprisoned for six years and frequently tortured. Boudchar was taped head to foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight. She was four and a half months pregnant at the time.Four weeks later, a second leading opponent of Gaddafi was kidnapped in Hong Kong after an MI6 tipoff and flown to Tripoli with his wife and four children. He settled his claim against the British government in 2012, receiving £2.2m. Documents discovered in government offices in Tripoli during the Libyan revolution show the kidnap operations followed lengthy MI6 surveillance of the two men.Papers recovered at the same time show that information subsequently extracted under torture from the two men was used to justify the detention and attempted deportation of a number of Libyans living in Britain.There were also papers that detailed the way in which Gaddafi’s intelligence officers were invited to Britain, where they allegedly threatened Libyan asylum seekers and British-Libyan nationals, in the presence of MI5 officers. Asked whether it was resisting Ashton’s request because it did not wish to see further evidence of unlawful and politically embarrassing activities coming to light, the Cabinet Office declined to comment.Ashton submitted his request for information in 2014 and hopes ultimately to achieve a greater understanding of the role the British government played in creating Libya as it is today.This would include examining British responses to the Lockerbie bombing and Gaddafi’s support for the IRA the period of rapprochement during which the rendition plots were hatched and the UK’s role in supporting the insurgency that eventually toppled the Gaddafi regime.“The public interest in understanding Britain’s policy towards Libya is overwhelming,” Ashton said. “It seems extraordinary that the Cabinet Office has resisted my freedom of information request at every turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/debc8958f23542f03e3fdcf5b9427206959666ce/0_245_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab846c262ccd6977c982ab62e2d3cac9","title":"venezuela brazil hunger highway","story":"Venezuela holds elections on Sunday but 5,000 people a day are leaving – many trekking a 215km route through the Amazonby Tom Phillips on the BR-174 highwayDaniel Guerra hit the Hunger Highway at dawn hoping to steal a march on the punishing heat of Brazil’s northern savannah and consign 21st-century socialism to his past. “Necessity forced me to come,” explained the 24-year-old Venezuelan as he trudged along the BR-174, a 215km (134-mile) ribbon of asphalt that cuts south across the Brazilian Amazon and is the main entry point for tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants fleeing economic meltdown back home.A month earlier, Guerra had watched with joy as his first child, a baby girl called Carmeyn, was born, nearly 1,000km north in the Venezuelan city of Maturín. Already, though, he had been forced to abandon her, propelled over the border into Brazil in search of food, work and, perhaps eventually, a fresh start for his family. “It was so difficult, just imagine,” Guerra said of the decision to leave his child.Guerra’s four marching companions, like him penniless, famished and unshaven, nodded grimly in agreement. “There’s no future in Venezuela,” said José Luis Moya, a 24-year-old from the north-eastern state of Anzoátegui who was making the trek with a gaping hole in his right sole. “We’re escaping because we don’t want to die.”Mired in economic, political and social crisis, Venezuela will hold a presidential election on 20 May – a vote the country’s mainstream opposition will boycott and which much of the international community has condemned as rigged.President Nicolás Maduro, who took power after Hugo Chávez’s death in 2013, rejects such criticism and has pledged to use a second term to bring a “new era of rebirth, hope and renewal” to a country critics say he has brought to its knees.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.For the 5,000 Venezuelans reported by the UN to be streaming out of the country each day those are fantastical claims. “Let’s be clear: we have no hope,” said Yorquis Rísquez, a 24-year-old mother who fled into Brazil earlier this year and now lives with her family in a dilapidated squat in the city of Boa Vista. “There’s no such thing as hope in Venezuela under this government. Our hope is bringing our kids here.”More than a million Venezuelans have headed west to Colombia since an exodus some call Latin America’s worst-ever migration crisis began in 2015, fueled by a toxic cocktail of economic strife and rampant violence. But a growing number, like Rísquez and her family, are choosing Brazil, which many see as a safer and, so far, less oversubscribed destination.For those unable to pay a bus fare, that means a grueling odyssey on foot down a road Brazil’s press has dubbed the Rota da Fome or Hunger Highway. The Highway starts just over the border from Venezuela, in the town of Pacaraima, and runs south to the regional capital Boa Vista, through the São Marcos indigenous reserve – a tapestry of sun-scorched settlements that are home to the Macuxi, Taurepang and Wapichana peoples. Media reports have highlighted the growing animosity towards migrants as they flock to this sparsely populated borderland, as well as their exploitation by unscrupulous ranchers. Several towns have seen protests in one a shelter was ransacked. Brazil’s far-right presidential frontrunner, Jair Bolsonaro, fanned those flames during a recent visit to Boa Vista, where thousands of Venezuelans are camped out in public squares, abandoned buildings or army-run shelters. “Nobody wants to show them the red card, load them on to trucks and send them back … But we also can’t carry on like this.”Yet the migrants have also found solidarity and kindness along the BR-174. “Today it’s them, but tomorrow it could be us,” said Oton Guimarães, the deputy tuxaua, or chief, of Vila Três Corações, a Macuxi village about 110km, or two days’ walk, south of Pacaraima. Seated in the shade of a tamarind tree, the softly spoken 67-year-old recalled how his community had opened its arms to Venezuela’s tired, poor and huddled masses, on the condition they obeyed local rules: “No fooling around, no disrespect, no alcohol.” “They show up here with their feet covered in blisters, very weak, dehydrated,” the headman said, adding poetically: “It’s an adventure, a destiny with no address.”Guimarães said dozens of passing migrants were offered free board and lodging in exchange for their work. “They’re trustworthy folk … They do a bit of everything and we are thankful,” he said. For a time, Guimarães even opened his own home to a migrant. “He built this toilet for me,” he remembered, pointing to a breeze-block outhouse nearby. Not all of the Highway’s indigenous communities have been so welcoming. In Entroncamento, village chief Maria Joana da Silva said she pitied the migrants. “But there’s nothing we can do … We don’t want them living here. “Lots of prisoners were released over there in Venezuela,” she added suggestively.In Boca da Mata, another roadside hamlet, chief Leoneide Torres said it was her Christian duty to help the families she often saw splayed out beside the road: “They arrive in a seriously precarious state. It’s hunger, real hunger.”But Torres, 53, was nervous too. “Our biggest worry is that in among them there are traffickers, drugs. We know this is happening. Some of them are coming over the hills back there … they have a detour so they don’t have to pass through the checkpoint.”Despite such suspicions, Efraín Godoy, a restaurant worker from the city of Barcelona, on Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, said he had been humbled by the reception he had received from the Macuxi.Godoy, 29, remembered staggering into Vila Três Corações in February, after three days on the Highway, sunburned, covered in insect bites and so dehydrated he was on the verge of vomiting. Locals offered him a hammock in the malocão – a traditional palm-thatched hut at the heart of their village – and, weeks later, he could be found helping cater for a summit of indigenous teachers that his adoptive home was hosting. “It’s all new to me … new and marvelous,” enthused Godoy, who planned to stay until his application for refugee status is approved and he can start looking for work to help the eight-member family he had left behind. Venezuela was marching backwards but Godoy was determined not to do the same, using his exile to learn Brazil’s language, Portuguese, and study its indigenous traditions. “It’s a unique experience that will stay with me forever.”For Guerra’s ragtag expedition such a reception still lay several days off – and their final destination, Boa Vista, further still. After a 15km slog in searing Amazonian heat they paused at Sorocaima, the first indigenous village south of the border.Guerra slumped to the ground outside a butcher’s shop, too exhausted to speak and apparently suffering from heat stroke. His comrades, though, were defiant, vowing to march on through the night. Moya said the Highway’s hardships paled into comparison with the suffering back home. “I feel happy because I’m moving towards a future,” he said as the men prepared to hit the Highway once again. “In Venezuela I felt dead. At least walking I have hope.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485999.1526310270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cao decision time how to pick the right course","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChoosing the right course involves a lot of research, but it’s well worth the effort.What should you study at college? Securing a degree at the end of three or four years of study is a major achievement, but you’ll manage it only if you have a genuine interest in the subject matter of the course itself, and you remain determined and focused on your studies from day one.Unfortunately, thousands of current Leaving Cert students have applied through the CAO process, seeking places on courses and in colleges which their friends plan to attend, or have applied for courses without doing any detailed research first.Many of these students will drop out of these courses by Christmas, once the reality of what’s involved in completing the programme dawns on them.Would you start a marathon on a whim? Absolutely not: such a task requires months of training and planning. Selecting a college course requires the same level of planning and commitment. If you think you might be one of these people who has not really thought through the course choices you have already listed, you have just over a month to rectify the situation. The final date you must finalise your course choices is July 1st. Between now and then there is the small matter of the Leaving Cert to complete. By now you are no doubt aware of the course options available to you depending on how you perform in the forthcoming exams. If not, Qualifax (qualifax.ie) has the details of every course on offer, and its advanced search facility will enable you to refine your search to those subjects that genuinely interest you. The litmus test is what will motivate you to get out of bed on a cold morning next winter, when nobody will be checking whether you do so or not, to attend lectures, study the topics in the library, write the assignments that such research will generate, and then pass your first-year exams either at Christmas or next May. At this stage your course choice need not be directly linked with what job you will get when you leave college in three or four years’ time, as the nature of most occupations change constantly due to changes in technology, reflected in the day-to-day operation of the real economy. Ensure you select a suitable courseAlthough your focus needs to be exclusively on your forthcoming exams in the weeks ahead, this does not prevent you reflecting on what it is that really motivates you when it comes to college faculties. Is it scientific research? A fascination with technology? Business? Languages? Liberal arts? Whatever your favourite subject, it should inform your course choices for college. You can intensify this process once the final papers are out of the way in the third week of June, up until July 1st when you must finally decide. If you think you will not have enough CAO points to get on to your first preference courses at your preferred college, look at other options farther afield, where smaller college populations may result in lower point requirements. You should also research local Further Education (FE) Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) options, which in many cases have reserved places linked to your preferred course, meaning you could secure a place on this CAO programme in September 2019, if you secure sufficient distinctions in your FE course in the coming academic year. Even if you are perfectly happy with your original CAO choices, it is wise to review them. Courses are discontinued all the time, and colleges often add new courses to the CAO system. Dozens of courses on offer now did not exist when the CAO printed its handbook last summer. Explore them now. Between now and July 1st, log on to your account on cao.ie and see what courses you have listed, and in what order. For the courses you have listed, study the full content of each year’s lectures and how they might allow you to progress to employment or postgraduate opportunities, on qualifax.ie.Where will a degree in the subject you select now lead to? Technological change is rapidly reshaping the nature of work, and a degree completed in 2021 or 2022 could well open opportunities in the labour market that have not yet been envisaged. So, don’t worry about it now just get your course choices right over the next month.What happens if I make that mistake? The price of failing to research fully the content of every programme you plan to list on your CAO application now, before the change-of-mind window closes on July 1st, can be costly. If you end up accepting a course that is not right for you, be it because you do not like the curriculum, you did not research the content thoroughly or you realise that you have selected a course you have no interest in, you may end up dropping out during the academic year or failing the exams.If either of these events happen and you decide to return to college the following year to study another course, you will have to pay another registration fee of €3,000 in 2019. You will also have to fork out the course fee of at least €4,000 that the Department of Education through the Higher Education Authority (HEA) will pay the college on your behalf this year. The HEA, on behalf of the State, will pay course fees only once for each year of an approved course. If you end up repeating a year, you (or more likely your parents) will have to pay. This extra €4,000 would bring your total fee for your first year to at least €7,000. This is far beyond the means of many families, especially when you factor in the living costs of attending college.Even if you choose a course at a private college this year, then leave it to follow one in a State-funded college next year, you still must pay the full fees. Fees paid to private colleges are tax deductible at 20 per cent on any charges over €3,000, and so are treated in the same way as State-funded places, even if you do not claim the tax relief.Things to check If, after detailed research, you have identified a list of courses that seem to fit your interests, make sure that you’re able to secure a place on all of them, and, of course, that you earn sufficient points in your Leaving Cert.Make sure that you meet all the entry requirements and have taken the required subjects at the appropriate level. (An example of this is the higher-level maths requirement for level 8 engineering degrees.) With this list in hand, put them in an order of preference or priority. The coming month will be one of the most intensive periods of engagement between colleges and prospective students. Colleges will facilitate inidual visits so that you can discuss any programme you are seriously considering. Contact the course director or programme office. (You’ll find phone numbers and email addresses in the college prospectus or on the college website.) If you have not already done so, visit both the college and the department, to get a feel for the course and the surroundings. When you have completed this process – again, make sure it’s before July 1st – list your final course choices on your CAO record in the order you want them, allowing for all possible Leaving Cert results. You have up to 10 choices at both level 8 higher degrees and level 7 and 6 ordinary degrees and higher certificate programmes. Never disregard the level 7 and 6 courses out of academic snobbery: almost all these programmes allow you to progress to the level 8 higher degree with an additional year of study. Do not finalise your choices without consulting the key adults in your life, such as your parents and guidance counsellor. If the school year has finished by the time you have finalised your course choices, your guidance counsellor will probably be happy to meet you or to discuss your choices by phone.Whatever you do, once you have completed your research and made your final list of choices, don’t be tempted to revisit this process from some far-off internet cafe in a beach resort. Mature students and deferrals If you are a mature applicant, have already completed your Leaving Cert or have requested a deferral of your place, you may receive an offer of a CAO place any time after July 4th. If you get any offer from the CAO and do not accept the place within a week, your offer lapses and you cannot retrieve it."},{"url":null,"title":"is progression to college directly from school the only route","story":"Ireland has been transformed as a society by the introduction of free second-level education 50 years ago which enabled children to build careers based on the pen rather than the shovel.The life-long benefits generated by staying in school up to and beyond the Leaving Cert have been well learned by today’s generation of parents who benefitted from second-level education themselves. And, they now want their own children to progress automatically up through higher education to honours degree, masters and PhD levels.The unquestioning belief in Ireland that academic success directly relates to career success makes any option other than securing a CAO place in a third-level institution unacceptable to many.Underneath this lurks another reality. Many of those students who achieve modest Leaving Cert points scores of 300 points or less and who progress into CAO courses, drop out of college, often with a deep sense of failure.As their Leaving Cert results may have indicated, these students did not excel at academic learning in secondary school and the general academic routine associated with third level often proves to be a mismatch with their natural learning style.Our third-level system is constructed to reward linguistics. Students are encouraged to use words effectively and will often have highly developed auditory skills, will think in words, will like reading, play word games, and compose poetry or stories. Such iniduals can be taught by encouraging them to say and see words and read books together.Third level also rewards logical mathematical reasoning, abstract and conceptual thinking, and those who are able to see and explore patterns and relationships and can form concepts before tackling the details.Howard Gardener (1991) in his work on multiple intelligences helps us identify those who are likely to excel at third level, and those who will struggle in such an environment.He shows us that we all learn and come to know the world through language, logical-mathematical analysis, spatial representation, musical thinking, the use of the body to solve problems or to make things, an understanding of other iniduals, and an understanding of ourselves.According to Gardener, where we differ is in the strength of these intelligences – the so-called profile of intelligences – and in the ways in which such intelligences are invoked and combined to carry out different tasks, solve erse problems, and progress in various domains.So what about those young people who have struggled with linguistic and mathematical subjects in our academically orientated second-level Leaving Cert system? Would they not be better off progressing their learning in an environment where other learning styles are the medium through which teaching and learning takes place?This is where our system of Further Education (FE) and enhanced and expanding Apprenticeship programmes (where ongoing training and part-time study are built into the job) come into their own.These routes from school into adult life provide opportunities for tens of thousands of young and not so young learners every year to develop their abilities and skills, and consequentially their sense of self-worth and personal self-confidence.Sadly, many will still seek out a CAO place, however unsuitable it might be, in preference to an FE or apprenticeship because of the false perception that academic progression is always the default option to be taken.As a society we need to acknowledge and champion a far wider range of learning opportunities than those offered in academic education. For a significant cohort of those leaving second-level schools each year the option of studying for a QQI level 5 or 6 award at the local FE college or starting an apprenticeship, which mixes working in employment alongside study, is by far the most appropriate choice, even if a CAO place is available.Data provided by our third-level institutions show far higher retention rates from among FE graduates than from among school leavers from those who secure modest to average Leaving Cert results.The small class sizes within the FE sector, alongside the project-based assessment methods used, together with the prevalence of work placements with local employers, is particularly suitable to large numbers of our young people. Many programmes are designed in conjunction with local employers and are attuned to the employers’ needs. Therefore, the skills developed during the course are relevant to both the local and wider labour market.Further Education courses are provided in colleges throughout the entire country through the network of Education and Training Boards. They offer courses that are designed to consolidate the learning of those who excel in disciplines such as science, business and art, but who may need the year to acquire the skills to navigate their way successfully through a more formal degree programme in their area of interest at university or at an IT.Much publicity has been given over recent years to the growth of degree programmes taught through English in western European traditional universities, and universities of applied sciences, particularly in the Netherlands. What is less well known is that the universities of applied sciences are more than happy to offer places to Irish FE students based on their level 5 and 6 awards. I recently met two Irish students who are progressing successfully through physiotherapy degrees in two Dutch universities of applied sciences.Details of every FE course on offer in Ireland are available through the qualifax.ie website. The links between FE courses and CAO programmes, where reserved places are allocated to students based on the quality of their award, are available through careersportal.ie. The EU programmes taught through English which offer places to those holding FE awards are available on eunicas.ie.Solas is the national co-ordinating body for apprenticeships in Ireland. In the past few years it has been working to rebuild our traditional apprenticeships and develop a whole range of new ones across all sectors of the economy.Apprenticeships are traditionally associated with the construction and motor industries and with young men. They have provided high-quality training and employment opportunities for generations of learners who preferred doing as opposed to academic pursuits. Following the crash in 2008 the entire construction sector and, to a lesser extent, the motor industry fell apart and the apprenticeship route practically disappeared as an option for school leavers from 2009-2016.Thankfully, the construction industry is rapidly recovering and opportunities for young school leavers who have an aptitude for practical roles across the entire range of trades is expanding. The Construction Industry Federation (CIF) has a dedicated website, apprentices.ie, to enable those interested in securing an apprenticeship in the industry to link up with local contractors who may be recruiting young apprentices.Many of our existing apprenticeships are world class. People often extol the virtues of the German and Swiss systems and that is completely justified, but Irish apprentices are also well regarded abroad and Ireland consistently does well at Worldskills Competitions, the Skills Olympics. In the last competition in Brazil in 2015, Ireland came 11th in the world rankings and we won a gold medal for aircraft maintenance this was our fourth consecutive medal in aircraft maintenance, and we are the only country in the world to have achieved this.Ireland is now an economy where full employment is within touching distance and we have the potential to provide a range of educational and training opportunities for people of all ages in tune with each inidual personal learning style, which will meet the needs of learners and the wider economy.We need to embrace the ersity of opportunity now on offer and overcome our obsession with one specific model offered by university education.A new Commis Chef Apprenticeship Programme was launched in January 2018. The programme is of two years duration and training takes place both on and off the job each week. At the end of the programme, apprentices will be awarded a Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Culinary Arts. Apprentices on the programme will be employed by hotels, restaurants and catering companies throughout the country and will be paid industry-standard rates of pay while undertaking both on-the-job and off-the-job training.Since the demise of plants such as Ford in Cork in the 1960s, Ireland has not had a culture of providing high-quality manufacturing apprenticeships. In May 2018 Combilift opened a €50 million 46,500 sq m purpose-built factory set on a 100-acre site, with 11 acres of roof space. It is one of the largest manufacturing operations under one single roof in the Republic of Ireland, equivalent to 3½ Croke Parks. It manufactures fork lift trucks and other lifting products, exporting 98 per cent of production to 85 countries with more than 40,000 units sold to date.Combilift employs 550 people and an additional 200 jobs are due to be created over the next three years across all areas from skilled technicians, design engineers, logistics and supply chain specialists and those with mechanical and electrical mechatronics skills. Combilift led the establishment of the Engineering Traineeship with CMETB in 2015. All successful graduates of the course in 2017 were offered full-time employment with Combilift.There is an insurance practitioner apprenticeship offered online over three years through IT Sligo. On successful completion the apprentice is awarded a Level 8 BA (Hons.) in Insurance Practice. The lead industry partner for this apprenticeship is the Insurance Institute of Ireland. It involves four days a week paid on-the-job training, and one day a week off-the-job and online."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Health standards agency finds high levels of non-compliance at Stewarts Care centreJim Ferry\u0026rsquos lawyers tell High Court he \u0026lsquopanicked\u0026rsquo and evaded an arrest warrantBig viewer numbers for RT\u0026Eacute referendum debate make a good night for anti-RepealersCabinet meeting to discuss proposals including review of HSE management systemsThe evolving human person has been a \u0026lsquonon-person\u0026rsquo in debate by pro-life and pro-choice supportersAirline says changes introduced to give paying customers more time to select seatsBaby born at Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar died just months after his fatherAt issue is route through 500 metres in an area of \u0026lsquogreat scenic beauty\u0026rsquo in Glencree valleyFormer Anglo CEO says transactions between Anglo and ILP were not fraudulentMcGuinness, Clifford and McCabe say Taylor told them he sent texts in smear campaignRecent spell of calm conditions to continue over coming days, according to Met \u0026EacuteireannPilot Niall Bowditch and Kasper Kacprzak (7) died when a plane crashed near EdenderryDublin commuters had no trains between MalahideHowth and Killester this morningNumber of under-6s seen free more than doubles at eight north Dublin practices\u0026lsquoI am a democrat and I have to accept the outcome of a referendum and elections\u0026rsquoMichael McDowell warns that \u0026lsquohard cases and bad law together make for tragedies\u0026rsquoNearly 4,000 women still waiting for callback from CervicalCheck helplineHere\u0026rsquos how to go about choosing the best course and the right college for youSix-storey Kilternan block would be followed by offices and more housing, developer saysCouncil hopes move will prompt families to use financial supports and rent independently"},{"url":null,"title":"barnier on brexit ireland has the full support of all european states","story":"  April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by June   April 30, 2018DUP leader Arlene Foster says Barnier does not understand unionist culture   April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator says preparations must be made for no agreement on visit to Border area   May 1, 2018EU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator presses British for rapid agreement as DUP raises temperature   May 1, 2018Varadkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutions   May 7, 2018Key allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreed "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495755.1526371424!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the no side needs to make headway now but it s not happening","story":"RTE presenter Claire Byrne had to ask members of the audience to \u0027refrain from calling people liars\u0027 after many heated exchanges between audience and panel members on the RTE Eight Debate.

Photograph: Artur WidakAFPGettyIf there is to be a move in the abortion-referendum campaign, then this is moving week.A slew of polls early in the campaign painted more or less the same picture: a substantial lead for the Yes side, and a pretty solid foundation for that support. That lead is not unassailable, and a dramatic late swing to the No side, of the sort we have seen in other referendum campaigns, could change the outcome.If that is to happen it is likely to happen in the next seven days, as undecided and weakly committed voters begin to make up their minds. If the No side is going to turn it around it needs to make some headway, and fast.It is those middle-ground swing voters whom the No side will have to target in the remaining days of the campaign if the current trajectory is to change. There is little sign that it is doing so with any purpose or success, however. Many of its posters and messages have been more directed at its base, the 30 to 35 per cent of voters who do not want constitutional change, rather than at the chunk in the middle who want change but are not sure if they want it to be to the extent the Government has proposed. It is important to get your base out in any election or referendum, but there are simply not enough in the anti-abortion base to win this referendum.All inidual polls are susceptible to error taken together, dozens of them rarely are. And, combined, all the polling of the past 18 months and before tells us that a settled majority of Irish voters is in favour of liberalising the law on abortion the majorities for legal abortion in the “hard cases” of rape, fatal foetal abnormalities, threats to the health of the woman and so on are huge. They will not change. That is a great advantage to the repealers.The retain side can win only if it convinces enough soft repealers and undecided voters that the Government’s proposal to legalise abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy is a step too far. But those soft repealers are not responsive to the uncompromising abortion-is-murder message that has underpinned much No side campaigning. If you are talking about dead babies you are not talking to the middle ground.A major No side pivot that would see it address the middle ground was expected but has not materialised. Not yet, anyway. Facebook and Google’s decision to restrict and cancel referendum advertising disproportionately affected the No side. It has made the pivot harder.It has also angered No campaigners, feeding their sense that the establishment – the Government and the media – is ranged against them. And when you are angry it’s harder to talk to the middle ground.By contrast the Yes side has been better at taking a softly-softly approach to its pitch to the middle. It has talked about the hard cases, about the realities of women’s lives, about lived experience. It is easier for the repealers to talk to the middle ground, because they have more in common with them. But they have also been better at it than their opponents have. The campaign has by and large cultivated a message discipline and focus largely absent from its early stages (and still wholly absent online, although that may not matter).None of this means there can’t be a change in the campaign as it enters its final stage. But it does mean it is hard to see where it would come from. For now, anyway, it’s advantage repeal.

Photograph: Matt CardyGettySo nostalgic and moleskin-trousered by stereotype, Britain’s Eurosceptic right is actually mesmerised by technology. In the referendum campaign, Leavers espoused the power of digital communication to collapse geographic distance, and make India as viable an export market as France.Now, faced with the riddle of how to leave the customs union without compromising supply chains or peace along the Irish Border, they bank on unspecified inventions to finesse the problem over time.This vein of techno-optimism does not run through Brussels, where “maximum facilitation” has few supporters, or even London, where Theresa May, the prime minister, tries to sell colleagues on a simpler customs partnership with the EU. Such is the minutiae behind an intra-Conservative Party war fought in increasingly public view.The mystery is why, with a hardish Brexit so close, Leavers would choose to die in this particular ditch. The customs partnership would not prevent an independent British trade policy. Britain would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this seems a small nuisance next to the prize of exit. And if the technology really does emerge, partnership can be swapped for max fac later on.Yet Boris Johnson, whose survival as foreign secretary is a daily reproach to May’s judgment, calls her idea “crazy”. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP goes with “completely cretinous”. Ministers whom she has asked to war-game the policy will do so with clothes pegs on their noses and expressions of distaste.There is something forced, almost thespian, about their complaints. After all, their dream is near. Why imperil it? Leavers did not just win the referendum, but the interpretation of the result, too. Britain is leaving the customs union and the single market, despite the closeness of the vote and the ambiguity of its meaning. We have lived through the gradual normalisation of a type of exit that was held to be “hard” in the days after the referendum.May has been a gift to the Leavers. As a rookie prime minister, hemmed in by advisers who failed to last the course, it was she who drew the red lines that left little to negotiate with the EU. “Trust me,” she wrote in the Sunday Times last weekend, but they should trust her implicitly by now.Why, then, this struggle among Leavers to take yes for an answer? Perhaps it is sincere, and they read into the difference between max fac and customs partnership a significance that is worth delaying an exit deal for. But with various pressures against them – time, the House of Lords’ enthusiasm for the single market – a passionate Leaver would surely compromise at this stage.Which is why we must entertain a more cynical theory. A good number of Leavers do not want to be associated with the exit deal that Britain eventually strikes with the EU, whatever its content. To that end, they are inventing grievances. Disavowal of the agreement allows them to escape blame if economic life deteriorates after its implementation, or voters feel no compensating thrill of self-government. “If only we had left properly,” would serve as the Leavers’ defence against popular anger.The betrayal narrative writes itself. A cabinet resignation or two would help it along. Johnson’s behaviour is consistent with that of a man who wants to be fired. Having won the referendum as rebels, endorsement of the official deal would turn the Leavers into apologists for a new status quo overnight, with all its imperfections and disappointments. Not just MPs, but newspapers too, would have to explain away the non-materialisation of Shangri-La on British soil. Neither temperament nor experience equips them for life as pragmatic defenders of a flawed but liveable reality. They will do what they can to prevent the change in role.And if their vexatious complaints prevent any deal being agreed, then, for some of them at least, so much the better. A certain kind of Leaver has always loathed the idea of exit talks, as though European permission were needed, and hates even more the prospect of entanglement in budget payments, regulatory agencies and the like.If all this seems implausibly calculated, then remember what the alternative explanation is. You have to believe that people who have devoted their adult lives to the cause of EU exit would, on the brink of their dream’s orderly enactment, become immovable on the details of customs regimes that merited no mention before.I do not believe it. Even their language (“crazy”, “cretinous”) suggests the histrionics of a ham actor. Leavers demand everything from a Brexit deal except their names on the paper. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495758.1526371865!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may invites conservative mps to briefings to discuss brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May said there were  flaws in both  customs models being considered by the government. Photograph: AP British prime minister Theresa May has invited all Conservative backbench MPs to private Brexit briefings in Downing Street on Tuesday, as she tried to stop a row over Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU tearing the party apart. Ms May admitted there were flaws in both the customs models being considered by the government, a view reinforced by Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, at a foreign affairs meeting in Brussels. “So he thinks it’s unnecessary to fight about it, as none of them are realistic, no matter which one they choose.”Ms May is being urged by senior Tories to abandon her support for a so-called “customs partnership” with the EU, with hopes rising in Eurosceptic circles that the prime minister will switch her support to their favoured option.Ms May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell gave Tory MPs what one called “a technical briefing” on the advantages and flaws of the two customs options being considered by ministers and which have split the cabinet.The prime minister has abandoned hopes of resolving the issue this week, but is hoping to finally agree a favoured customs proposal next week. “This is complex stuff,” said one aide. “This was a chance to explain the issues and take questions.”Ms May’s preferred option - a “new customs partnership” under which Britain would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU - was rejected by a majority of her inner Brexit cabinet earlier this month. Boris Johnson called it “crazy”.Pro-Brexit ministers, including Mr Johnson, back a “maximum facilitation” plan that would create a customs border between Britain and the EU, including in Ireland, but use technology and “trusted trader” schemes to smooth trade. The political mood appears to be shifting towards the latter option, even though the EU has warned that it would not address its demand that there should be no hard border in Ireland.Damian Green, Ms May’s former deputy and a close ally for many years, suggested on Sunday that a form of “max fac” could emerge as the preferred option, but that Britain might have to stay in a customs union while the technology was developed.British chancellor Philip Hammond is also said by colleagues to be willing to consider that approach, although he remains worried about the impact of any customs border on British companies trading with the EU. Greg Clark, the pro-European business secretary, paid a visit to Svinesund on the Norway-Sweden border on Monday morning to examine how customs arrangements work there.“Greg wanted to see it to get a proper understanding of how an example of ‘max fac’ could work in practice, and it was definitely not without friction,” said one ally.Meanwhile David Miliband, former Labour foreign secretary, returned to the British political fray on Monday to join a cross-party campaign for a soft Brexit.“Britain is being held to ransom by demands for a hard Brexit, severing links with the customs union and single market,” Mr Miliband said.Mr Miliband shared a platform with Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Commons Treasury committee, calling for Britain to retain very close ties to the EU. - Financial Times Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan markles wedding cake royal bakes ages","story":"Meghan and Harry have chosen their wedding cake, and it is to be a celebration of spring a zingy, floral confection with firm nods to all of the current fashionable food preoccupations - seasonality, provenance and natural ingredients.

Both players were born in Germany to immigrant Turkish families.The row comes at a time of debate in Germany over integrating immigrant communities, but it has been made more explosive by public anger towards Mr Erdogan over the arrest of several German citizens in Turkey as part of a government crackdown on opponents.Deniz Yücel, a German journalist, was held for over a year in a Turkish prison without trial on suspicion of espionage before being released and allowed to return to Germany.“Posing with the Turkish president is not the sort of behavior that befits the German national team,” Ralf Stegner, deputy leader of Angela Merkel’s coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), said yesterday.“Posing in a London luxury hotel with the despotic Erdogan and courting him as \u0027my president\u0027 while he is oppressing democrats and imprisoning critical journalists in Turkey, is a gross foul,” Sevim Dagdelen of the opposition Left Party said.“It’s strange that German footballers would let themselves be used in the election campaign of a Turkish president who has so recently made disparaging remarks about Germany,” Hans-Peter Friedrich, deputy speaker of the German parliament said.Mr Erdogan faces re-election next month and has been accused of using his 3-day visit to the UK to campaign for the votes of expatriate Turks.“The president of a German football national player is Frank-Walter Steinmeier, not Recep Tayyip Erdogan,” Cem Özdemir of the Green Party, one of Germany’s highest profile politicians of Turkish heritage, said.“It is distasteful and embarrassing for football millionaires to be harnessed to the election campaign of an authoritarian ruler and to pay homage to him.”Despite the furore the two players were both named as part of the German World Cup preliminary squad on Tuesday by Jogi Löw, the national coach.Both players feature in the German squad for the 2018 World Cup in RussiaOliver Bierhoff, the national team manager, said he had spoken with both players about the incident and that they were “unaware of the symbolism and meaning of this photo”.Reinhard Grindel, the president of the German Football Association (DFB), said: “Football and the DFB stand for values ​​that Mr Erdogan does not respect. That\u0027s why it\u0027s not acceptable that our national team players are exploited for his election campaign.”“It was not our intention to make a political statement, let alone to campaign with this image,” Mr Gündogan said in a statement. “As German national players, we are committed to the values ​​of the DFB and are aware of our responsibility.”Please review our commenting policyRoyal wedding procession route 2018 - map and timetable to help you navigate WindsorRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest updatesWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

However a last-minute setback has called the couple\u0027s plans into confusion, with Ms Markle\u0027s father Thomas – who was to walk his daughter down the aisle – claiming on Monday that he was no longer planning to attend the ceremony.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, he has reportedly changed his plans.Yet the wheels for the wedding are still in motion, with the couple promising a wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.So what\u0027s in store? Here\u0027s all the latest news about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.Thomas Markle Snr is apparently not coming to the wedding after reports this weekend that he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself in the run-up to the ceremony and has suffered a heart attack.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.The celebrity website TMZ first reported that Meghan\u0027s father had pulled out of the wedding. The site stated that it had spoken to the US actress\u0027 father, saying: He\u0027s now decided not to go because he doesn\u0027t want to embarrass the Royal Family or his daughter.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsPrince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesMs Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding procession route 2018 - map and timetable to help you navigate WindsorRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding procession route 2018 - map and timetable to help you navigate WindsorRoyal wedding guest list: Who is invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?How to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest updatesArsenal star Mesut Ozil criticised by German football association after posing with Turkey’s ErdoganTrump threatens to use US trade talks to force NHS to pay more for drugs UK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranThomas Markle, father of the bride, pulls out of royal wedding ceremony after paparazzi rowFirst budget flights to India launch - but how do they compare to BA?\u0026#39Vulnerable\u0026#39 student died after taking \u0026#39highly toxic\u0026#39 diet pills ordered from the internet, court hearsDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Ryanair is changing the way you check in – and people are not happyPutin opens bridge to Crimea, Russia\u0026#39s first road link with annexed peninsulaPanic and complacency: how the world reacts to disease outbreaksMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerFormer youth football coach Kit Carson to stand trial accused of 13 counts of child sex abuseBelgian clown \u0026#39murdered\u0026#39 mother in front of her children after roping in sidekick in alleged revenge plotRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Shoreham Airshow disaster pilot to stand trial accused of causing 11 deathsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"watch prince harry meghan markles royal wedding saturday","story":"There\u0027s not long to go until the Royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, which takes place this Saturday.

Despite some anecdotal evidence that shortages of European workers may have pushed up wages, there’s precious little evidence of that in the aggregate data. Real wages grew less than half a percent in the year to March in the year before the referendum, when close to 300,000 Europeans joined the workforce, they grew by 1.5 per cent.What the blue passport row tells us about our economy after BrexitImmigration, and in particular free movement, was one of the key factors – many would argue the key factor – behind the Brexit vote. Yet since, late last year, the government conceded that free movement would continue precisely as now until the end of the so-called “transition” period in December 2020, we’ve heard very little about it in the context of the Brexit debate.Over the last few months, far more column inches have been devoted to the subject of the Irish border and the Customs Union – hardly mentioned during the campaign, and certainly not big vote-winners on either side – than to the subject of the UK’s post-Brexit immigration policy.Perhaps in parallel, public concern about immigration has fallen sharply – the proportion naming it as one of the most important issues facing Britain has fallen from well over half at the time of the referendum to less than a fifth now.Is this because the public think that Brexit means that we’ve “taken back control?” That seems unlikely to happen before 2021 at the earliest. Because the numbers have fallen? They remain historically high overall. Because there is greater public awareness that falling immigration has its (very considerable) downsides, including increased pressure on an already vastly overstretched NHS? Or simply because the papers have stopped writing quite so many scare stories? At this point, no-one can be sure.But in any case immigration has pushed itself back on to the agenda. The Windrush scandal has nothing to do with Brexit: it is the predictable (and predicted) consequence of the “hostile environment” measures introduced by Theresa May as Home Secretary during the 2010-15 government. Policies were designed to “root out illegals” (in the words of one of the policy’s leading supporters, David Goodhart) by making life difficult or impossible for people who cannot (as the Prime Minister put it of one Windrush-era arrival) “evidence their settled status.”These have inevitably hit some people who arrived here legitimately a long time ago, as well as the thousands of children who were born or grew up here but cannot afford the Home Office’s exorbitant fees. But at some point in the future, the “hostile environment” policy will be the primary means by which we enforce immigration policy against EU nationals as well as those from beyond. Remember that, despite the Prime Minister’s deliberately misleading rhetoric, ending free movement has little or nothing to do with border control. Controls – over access to employment, health care and housing –  will happen well inside our borders.And Windrush is just the tip of the iceberg. In the last few weeks, the Prime Minister has intervened personally to stop NHS hospitals hiring desperately needed doctors from outside the EU, ignoring pleas from virtually every Department involved.Most people have a more balanced view of immigration than you thinkDespite clear evidence of maladministration (to put it charitably) the Immigration Minister has refused to correct the Home Office’s error in deporting students falsely accused of cheating, or to intervene in the cases of highly skilled migrants threatened with deportation on obviously spurious grounds. And taxpayers face a large bill for compensation to EU migrants deported in clear violation of the law.What do all these issues have in common? The answer is that they are a combination of the Prime Minister’s fixation on the net migration target, which leads to policies that focus on reducing numbers (either by stopping people coming here or by finding ways to kick out those already here) and a toxic Home Office culture, where there has been, and still is, absolutely no incentive at any level to take account either of the impact of decisions on iniduals or on the broader interest of the UK.The result is policies that manage to combine arbitrary cruelty with economic illiteracy. And while the Prime Minister must bear the main responsibility, senior civil servants have a lot to answer for as well.So Sajid Javid needs to get a grip both on the policy and the administration of his Department – and this can’t wait for Brexit. The assumption in both Whitehall and Westminster was that – having been originally been promised fully a year ago – the government was set on “kicking the can” on the post-Brexit immigration system until at least the end of the year.This was partly for good reasons. The Home Office has enough on its plate already, and the independent Migration Advisory Committee will produce a comprehensive review of the evidence on the impact of EU migration in September, incorporating new research. And partly because Brexit-related paralysis has also infected this area of policy  – the Cabinet is unable to agree whether there should be any preference for EU nationals in the new system.But rumours (unconfirmed as yet) suggest that the long-delayed Immigration White Paper may be published before the summer Parliamentary recess.This is both an opportunity and a risk. It would be unfortunate if the White Paper pre-empted the big strategic questions on “European preference” decision or related ones on the structure of the new system. Policy first, evidence later is not a good look.However, the new Home Secretary has an ideal opportunity to get ahead of the game on the wider strategy. The Prime Minister’s diktat may mean that he can’t ditch the net migration target – which his predecessor never mentioned if she could possibly help it – entirely. But he could take advantage of the clear consensus within Cabinet to remove the absurd quotas on skilled workers that are keeping out much-needed doctors, and reset policy on international students, including fiddling with the target in some way. Neither of these changes would be controversial anywhere outside Number 10 Downing Street.And at the same time he could signal that he was serious about getting to grips with the Home Office culture, by establishing new presumptions (normal in some other Departments but radical in the Home Office) that the job of civil servants is to administer law and policy sensibly, proportionally and in the interests of the public and holding his officials to account for actually doing that.Pressing the reset button on an immigration policy that has failed in every possible way – economically, politically and morally – would not just be right thing to do, it would be a real boost for “Global Britain”, both at home and abroad.Jonathan Portes is a senior fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe research group and professor of economics and public policy at King’s College Londonor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The new handset – which packed new internals into the small body of the iPhone 5 – proved immediately popular, and Apple is said to have been surprised by the scale of the interest in the new phone.Now Apple is rumoured to be updating the two-year-old handset. The sheer quantity of the rumours does appear to suggest that something is on the way – though it\u0027s not clear what exactly that might be.Apple finds technique that could revolutionise how iPhones are madeThe company might simply choose to upgrade the internals so that they are faster and more fresh, without making any major changes to the outside. That was suggested by usually reliable analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who said earlier this year that his sources in the supply chain didn\u0027t appear to be expecting a drastic overhaul that would bring new features like wireless charging or the iPhone 8\u0027s glass back.However, some rumours suggest a far more extreme change. Leaks that claim to have come from the Chinese supply chain have suggested that the company could be preparing an update to the iPhone SE that would make it more like an iPhone X – including that phone\u0027s edge-to-edge display and the trademark notch that cuts into it – though those rumours are far from confirmed.Many of the rumours suggest that the new phone could come sooner rather than later, and that it will launch long before the main updates to the iPhone arrive in September.If the phone does receive a significant upgrade, it is unlikely that the company would reveal it without an event at the same time. There will probably be only one event before the major iPhone reveal in the Autumn – Apple\u0027s Worldwide Developers Conference, where it tends not to reveal new hardware.But if only the insides receive an upgrade to make them faster, then it is possible Apple could release the new phone with a simple press release.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There\u0027s water. There\u0027s energy. There\u0027s some amount of carbon material. But the habitability of Europa is one of the big questions that we want to understand, said planetary scientist Elizabeth Turtle of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.Mars helicopter to fly around red planet on Nasa\u0027s next rover missionAnd one of the really exciting things about detection of a plume is that that means there may be ways that the material from the ocean – which is likely the most habitable part of Europa because it\u0027s warmer and it\u0027s protected from the radiation environment by the ice shell – to come out above the ice shell. And that means we\u0027d be able to sample it, Turtle told a NASA briefing.The research, headed by University of Michigan space physicist Xianzhe Jia, was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.The findings support other evidence of plumes from Europa, whose ocean may contain twice the volume of all Earth\u0027s oceans. NASA\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in 2012 collected ultraviolet data suggestive of a plume.NASA will get a close-up look from a new spacecraft during its Europa Clipper mission that could launch as soon as June 2022, providing a possible opportunity to sample plumes for signs of life, perhaps microbial, from its ocean.Europa is considered among the prime candidates for life in our solar system, but is not the only one. For example, NASA\u0027s Cassini spacecraft sampled plumes from Saturn\u0027s ocean-bearing moon Enceladus that contained hydrogen from hydrothermal vents, an environment that may have given rise to life on Earth.A bit smaller that Earth\u0027s moon, Europa\u0027s ocean resides under an ice layer 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 km) thick, with an estimated depth of 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 km).Additional reporting by ReutersThe Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

First discovered by Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe a decade earlier, Kosok had photographed them from the air and realised their true form.Reiche was transfixed by his account and, after visiting the 140 square mile site, committed herself to their study as Kosok\u0027s side, describing the landscape as a huge blackboard where giant hands have drawn clear and precise geometric designs.Spending many nights camping in the desert, Maria became an object of curiosity herself: The locals either thought I was a spy or completely mad. Once a drunk threatened me with a stone, so I took out my sextant and pointed it at him. He ran off screaming, and the next day the local papers ran the story of a mad and armed German spy in their midst.Reiche and Kosok\u0027s study of the Nazca Lines in the 1940s led to the dramatic conclusion that the beasts were actually roughly equivalent to the signs of the zodiac and that they together comprised an early astronomical calendar, mapping out the celestial bodies in the heavens. The geoglyph of a monkey is seen on the plains of the Nazca desert in southern Peru (Reuters)Her book The Mystery of the Pampas (1949) detailed the theory that the giant monkey geoglyph was the Nazca interpretation of the Great Bear constellation, whose movement across the night sky was used to mark time and predict the onset of the rainy season. Her work debunked a myth popularised by Swiss conspiracy theorist Erich von Daniken that they were made by extraterrestrials.Although Reiche\u0027s conclusion has now been largely sidelined in favour of the idea that the geoglyphs served a more earth-bound ceremonial purpose, she nevertheless played a vital role in preserving them, sweeping the lines, preventing vehicles from driving over them and ensuring they received Unesco protected status in 1994.The Lady of the Lines spent her days living in a Nazca tourist hotel, was granted Peruvian citizenship in 1992 and published her complete scientific findings Contributions to Geometry and Astronomy in Ancient Peru in 1993 at the age of 90. She died of ovarian cancer in June 1998, a beloved figure in her adopted homeland.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In fact, the strangeness of our own universe might better be explained by an undiscovered natural law, they said.The idea of the multiverse comes about because in physics terms, our universe is very lucky to exist at all.Scientists launch huge survey to find alien lifeCurrent theories predict there should be much more dark energy inside of our own universe than there is. That is a problem because adding more dark energy would lead it to expand so quickly that any matter would be diluted before it could form the stars or planets that we need to live.In response to that, some have suggested that we might in fact be living inside of a multiverse. There are in fact lots of different universes – many of which will have more dark energy and so could not host life – and we simply live inside one that worked out in the right way.But the new study suggests that we might have been overstating how lucky we are. It might actually be possible for stars and planets to form even if there is much more dark energy.“We asked ourselves how much dark energy can there be before life is impossible?” said Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia. ”Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise. Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe.”It is still true that our universe could be very special. But it does not need to be quite so special, the researchers showed.“The multiverse was previously thought to explain the observed value of dark energy as a lottery – we have a lucky ticket and live in the Universe that forms beautiful galaxies which permit life as we know it,” said Luke Barnes, a John Templeton research fellow at Western Sydney University.“Our work shows that our ticket seems a little too lucky, so to speak. It’s more special than it needs to be for life. This is a problem for the multiverse a puzzle remains.”That puzzling fact might suggest that the multiverse theory is not true in the first place. The study does not rule out the idea but does suggest that the small amount of dark energy in our universe would be better explained by a law of nature that we do not yet know about.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It comes amid allegations that he cooperated with an LA based photo agency to stage pictures of himself getting ready for the wedding.Earlier this month Kensington Palace announced that Mr Markle, a retired television lighting engineer who lives in Mexico, would give his daughter away to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle this Saturday.Mr Markle told TMZ he suffered a heart attack six days ago but checked himself out of the hospital so he could attend the wedding.But according to the site Mr Markle has “now decided not to go because he doesn’t want to embarrass the royal family or his daughter”.Everything you need to know about the royal weddingLive updates on the build-up to the Royal WeddingMeet the Meghan Markle superfans preparing for the royal weddingPrince Harry and Ms Markle have called for understanding and respect to be given to the Suits actor’s father.A Kensington Palace spokesperson said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.A number of media outlets published pictures of Mr Markle out and about getting measured for his wedding suit, reading a book about the UK while having coffee, and looking up reports about his daughter\u0027s wedding in an internet cafe. They initially appeared to have been taken by a paparazzo without Mr Markle\u0027s knowledge - but the Mail on Sunday later published CCTV footage which purported to showed Mr Markle and the photographer entering the internet cafe together.Ms Markle\u0027s half-sister, Samantha Markle, has now sought to defend their father and argued he was pressured into a dangerous situation.He was living a very quiet peaceful life, not as a recluse. He\u0027s a very intelligent man, he\u0027s been gregarious and worked in entertainment for 40 years,” she told Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announce their engagement.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Crown Liquor Saloon, Belfast during their visit to Northern Ireland.

Negotiations on the future with the UK have not started yet. We have had first exploratory discussions,” he said.Ms Zakharieva said the EU27 countries wanted more “intensive engagement by the UK government in the coming weeks”, warning that the October deadline was “only five months from now”.Negotiations on the future with the UK have not started yet.Ms May will next meet EU leaders in Brussels at the end of June for a meeting of the European Council.Ms Zakharieva said: “In June, we need to see substantive progress on Ireland, governance, and all remaining separation issues.

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen.

The single-cell organism Noctiluca scintillans, known as sea sparkle, was spotted on multiple locations all along the Dutch seaboard in the last few days.  They were mostly found in between the fishing port of Katwijk and the West Frisian Island of Terschelling.At night, amazed locals flocked to the beaches where they waded through the water to activate the algae to show off the bright colours. Algae is triggered by sudden movements, after which a chemical reaction makes them illuminate.The single-cell organism uses the bright neon-like lights as a defence mechanism against its natural enemies. Algae is not dangerous for human beings, although it can cause irritations to skin and the respiratory tract if people come in contact with large quantities.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account.

I just said it’s dead, this baby is going to die.I had no confirmation of this as I wasn’t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby’s heartbeat had dropped.I saw the baby’s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.”The tragic death happened on March 16, 2014, after the womans waters had broken early.It is alleged Dr Laxman should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section at the hospital in Dundee, as the baby was in a breech position.The hearing previously saw another doctor break down in tears as she recounted having to remove the babys head from his mothers uterus, saying: (It) is the most horrific experience anybody could have and it has haunted me so much.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: “If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery.We were set up for a C-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated.I was under the impression we were going to do a C-section and this caused us a delay - I didn’t know what she was planning.After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn’t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.She added: Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down - this was not what I was expecting.I was speaking to another doctor who said how is she going to do it - how is she going to deliver the head.She told the hearing the attempt to pull the baby out last for about 15-20 minutes.Dr Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby.Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a fragile baby like the infant who died would suffer a lot more damage if pulled or twisted.The tribunal had previously heard from the mother, known as Patient A, who said she had been assured she would be given a C-section in the event of a breech birth.Speaking to the distraught mother Dr Laxmans lawyer Gerard Boyle QC told her: “Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406170601.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"common cold cure","story":"UK researchers have identified a key protein in the body that allows the multiple viruses that cause a cold to spread through cells.The new treatment developed at London’s Imperial College blocks the protein, cutting off the infection at an early stage.In lab tests it worked within minutes on human lung cells.

Your actions are being reported to higher authorities.”Eventually after an hour or so the Spanish ship sails away but it comes just days after Gibraltar’s Deputy Chief Minister Dr Joseph Garcia told Members of the United States Congress that he will not cede an inch of its sovereignty, jurisdiction and control as the Rock prepares to leave the European Union.He also pointed to the danger of Spain challenging the status quo by redrawing the borders of Europe at a time of so much uncertainty and instability on the continent.In response to questions about the impact of Brexit, Dr Garcia explained that as the UK prepares to leave the European Union it is engaged in discussions with a number of Member States, including Spain, about Gibraltar.The Government of Gibraltar says it is directly involved in those meetings that are relevant to Gibraltar, positively seeking solutions which do not cross its red lines.“It remains to be seen whether Spain can find the political goodwill to move forward with solutions that do not impact on sovereignty.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re trying to work this out so he will come after all.” What we know so far...Prince Harry is also said to be blaming himself over the last-minute hitch - upset that he has not been able to protect his fiancée and her family from the glare of the media spotlight.The loved-up couple, who will tie the knot this Saturday at St Georges chapel, have reportedly been trying to contact Thomas to talk about his decision, but havent been able to speak with him. The recluse, who has been living in Mexico, had been expected to fly into London this week to meet the Queen and the royal family before the big day.But he confirmed to US website TMZ that he had been hurt both physically and emotionally by the ordeal - admitting that he thought the posed pictures were embarrassing.It was last night revealed that he was going to check back into hospital after more chest pains, having suffered a heart attack six days ago.And instead of walking his daughter down the aisle, Thomas has reportedly suggested his ex-wife and Meghans mother Doria Ragland should instead take on the role. Ladbrokes has since put it at 4/6 odds that Doria will be by Meghans side, while Prince Charles is tipped at 2/1.The Duke of Cambridge has also been tipped to step up to the plate, with 5/1 odds of walking Meghan down the aisle.Thomas admitted in an interview with TMZ that he did a deal with a photo agency to take pictures of him, saying he meant “no harm.”Kensington Palace said last night: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.“She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”The photographs showed him in Rosarito reading a book on British history, working out with weights, being measured for a wedding suit and looking up Harry and Meghan at an internet café.The pictures were sold around the world — before the Mail On Sunday revealed they had been staged.His confession is embarrassing for Kensington Palace, which had issued strong legal letters in an attempt to protect Thomas’s privacy.A pal of the Princes told the Daily Mail: The couple have been doing everything they can to help him.This is not what she wants.

I really don’t know what they were thinking. Exploiting animal for entertainment at parties — that time has passed. We know better we’ve been educated.”Mr Magill said he saw the tiger’s ears move to the side of its head, or flat back, both of which aren’t good signs.He added: “That’s what we call helicopter mode. It’s how we read cats.”Officials at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also blasted the decision, saying wild animals aren’t supposed to serve as prom decorations.A PETA official told NBC News: Displaying a tiger in a tiny cage and allowing students to handle lemurs is cruel to the animals and dangerous for the students, and it sends the harmful message that living beings are props to be used for human amusement.The school’s principal David Pugh has apologised for the tiger’s appearance and said he understood why some people were offended.School officials will now take a look at policies and procedures for events moving forward.Mr Pugh added: “We all have learned a great deal from this experience."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406320150.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle sister samantha piers morgan royal wedding","story":"Samantha Markle appeared on the show after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle as it was revealed he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Samantha, 53, claimed the media was to blame for her dads decision, saying the 73-year-old had been put under huge amounts of stress in the lead up to the big day at St Georges Chapel.Speaking with Piers Morgan and co-host Susanna Reid, Samantha said: I think he had the right to defend himself and get to the point where he wanted to say no - they have an ethical obligation to allow me to be portrayed as I am, living a healthy lifestyle and not be caught in unflattering situations as media vultures had done. What we know so far...But Piers immediately jumped in, saying: Theres no bigger media vulture with this wedding than you, is there Ms Markle?Piers rant comes despite Meghans extended family, including her nephews and sister-in-law, yesterday flying into the UK to act as special correspondents for GMBs special coverage of the wedding - which they havent been invited to.But in this mornings extraordinary blast, Piers said: How you can have the gall to come on here and talk about media vultures.

It was not for money.”She said she had no idea if he had been paid but added: “If he was it would have been a pittance. I’m entirely the culprit.I said to him to show the world ‘I’m getting in shape and getting healthy’ so I suggested it to benefit him and the Royal family.”Thomas’s grandson Tyler Dooley, 25, yesterday said his granddad had suggested only on Sunday that he would be at the wedding. He said: “My grandfather is in pieces – he is broken. He is not doing well.“He is a very reclusive guy — he has been in the spotlight his entire life behind the cameras and now he has been thrusted into all this with the Royals.“It is overwhelming. My grandfather just wants to be left alone — he wants the peace and the quiet back.”Tyler, a debt recovery worker, said of his Sunday discussion with Thomas: “He emailed me and I emailed him back.“He said he’s had some serious complications because of the stress, anxiety and pressure. I was also told that he had a heart attack. He had a pretty big health scare.“He told me that he loves me very much and he’s sorry about everything that’s happening.“He said plans to get the care and the help he needs after the wedding — which told me that he was going.”Tyler said he believes that Thomas will change his mind again and go to the ceremony — because he loves Meghan so much.He added: “There is no way he is not going to go to that wedding. That is his daughter and she loves him more than anything in the world.“I couldn’t be more proud of Meghan — she is everything to me.“She knows she has a big support base behind her and that’s all she needs to know.”If Thomas does not turn up, Doria will be the bride’s only immediate relative at Saturday’s wedding.But Tracey Dooley, estranged wife of Meghan’s brother Thomas Jr, is already in London with her two sons despite not having an invite.The three are set to appear on Good Morning Britain as part of the show’s Royal wedding coverage."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004042801581.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle father thomas photo deal","story":"The 73-year-old was caught up in controversy after he posed for paparazzi photographs in the run-up to his daughters big day this Saturday, with the snaps reportedly being sold to news outlets around the world for £100,000.Prince Harry and Meghan have appealed for understanding and respect to be given to the American actress father after he told TMZ that he has pulled out of the royal wedding.The celeb website has also claimed that Mr Markle did not strike the deal with a photo agency for money but instead to re-cast his public image ahead of the big day so the public would think of him in a more positive manner.He is reported to have been unhappy after previous pictures of him buying beer, looking dishevelled and reclusive has made him look like a lush.The beers are reported to have been intended for guards at his home, TMZ added.What we know so far...A Kensington Palace spokesman said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.Meghans half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault.The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family.We had no idea he would be taken advantage of.

I suggested he do positive photos. It was not for money. I have no idea [if he was paid] but if he was it would have been a pittance.“Im entirely the culprit.

Israeli forces used live fire in a measured and surgical way, the country\u0027s ambassador to the UK claimed. It came as the British government called for restraint after violence which claimed dozens of lives.  While Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Israeli forces\u0027 actions showed wanton disregard for international law.   The diplomat insisted that the protests were organised by militant group Hamas with an aim to breach the border, to get inside Israel and to kill Israeli citizens.  On Monday, Israeli forces killed 58 Palestinians, most by gunfire, and injured more than 2,700 during protests along the border.  Meanwhile a few miles away a ceremony was taking place in Jerusalem for the opening of the controversial new US embassy.  Mr Regev told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: We use live fire only in a very measured way, in a very surgical way and only when there is no alternative. He added: If we allow the Hamas terrorists to enter Israel, we will have dead Israelis. We must protect our border.  He acknowledged that Palestinians living in Gaza live a very difficult life, but he failed to attribute any blame to Israel. Instead he insisted: that\u0027s because they live in a prison controlled by Hamas - a theocratic, authoritarian regime that instead of investing its energy and its resources into building a better life for the people of Gaza invests its efforts in a holy war - their words, not mine - against Israel.  And he continued: Hamas is opposed to peace and reconciliation. Anyone who wants to see peace in the Middle East has to understand that Hamas is an enemy of that process.  Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said: We will not waver from our support for Israel\u0027s right to defend its borders. But the large volume of live fire is extremely concerning. We continue to implore Israel to show greater restraint. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: We cannot turn a blind eye to such wanton disregard for international law. That is why Labour is committed to reviewing UK arms sales to Israel while these violations continue. Palestinians were observing a general strike to mourn those killed in the deadliest day in Gaza since the 2014 war.

Robert Mugabe, Nicolae Ceaușescu and, most recently, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman have all been bestowed state visits.      But there is a growing fear the consequences of Brexit mean we will have to sacrifice more of our moral authority on the altar of economic deal-making.

It is especially rich that those Brexiteers who twisted the threat of Turkey’s potential membership of the EU to win referendum are now happy to kow-tow before Erdogan on his visit to London.   Boris Johnson, who played on fears about Turkey’s during the campaign and insulted Erdogan in a lewd poem , has since suggested we can do a “new jumbo free trade deal” with the country.   Mrs May’s press conference with Erdogan this afternoon could prove uncomfortable.   Will the Prime Minister dare to challenge the Turkish President on his human rights record?   And will she join Erdogan in condemning the slaughter in Gaza?

There was nothing about the phone call that made me think he was desperate. Frustrated, yes. But not desperate. Matthew was an absolute joy to bring up. He was so sensitive to how others felt. Tests after his death showed a small amount of cannabis was in Matthew\u0027s blood, and his friend told the hearing Matthew would often smoke the drug in communal areas of their flat, as well as in the shower in his room. Pathologist Dr Lorenzo Karsai gave hanging as the medical cause of death, but said cannabis could have impaired cognitive functions.

The flowers were spotted being carried into a truck in boxes outside Philippa Craddock\u0027s London depot, the florist preparing flowers for the Royal Wedding.

She said she\u0027d work with florists from St George\u0027s Chapel and Buckingham Palace to turn white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves into show-stopping creations.  Philippa provides flowers for weddings, events and brand campaigns.  At the time, Philippa said in an Instagram post: I am thrilled to share with you that we have been asked by Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle to create their wedding flowers in May.   I am loving working with them, it is an incredible privilege, and the designs will be a true reflection of them as a couple, with sustainability at the forefront. We will be using plenty of locally sourced greenery and seasonal flowers including peonies, garden roses and foxgloves.  Some of the foliage was expected to be gathered from The Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park, with beech, birch and hornbeam expected to feature. The flower arrangements will focus on flowers that are in season in May, and will have a wild feel - with bee-friendly plants from the Royal Parks\u0027 wildflower meadows set to be incorporated.

Thomas Markle Snr, 73, remains in North America - with Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials in the UK just four days away.  He had been expected to walk her down the aisle on Saturday, but last night it was claimed he no longer plans to give her away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi amid reports he had suffered a heart attack last week.  It\u0027s now emerged that the royal family were allegedly caught flatfooted when the news that he would not be attending broke last night, TMZ reports.  It added that up until that point the Palace had been planning a security detail, accommodation and access to events for the father of the bride. Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims that it was blindsided by the news when approached by MirrorOnline. The news has cast light on not just Thomas Snr but the wider Markle family - who were completely unknown until they were cast into the limelight when Meghan got engaged to Prince Harry.   Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland could walk the American actress down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle if Mr Markle doesn\u0027t attend the ceremony.   He claims he hasn\u0027t spoken to Meghan, 36, since reports emerged that he had decided not to attend the wedding.   Mr Markle told TMZ he\u0027s been popping Valium to ease his chest pains after suffering a heart attack, and he could return to hospital as early as Monday night.   Mr Markle told the website he suffered a heart attack six days ago and his new chest pains have been triggered by emotional upset. Reports suggest some plans for the wedding have been thrown into turmoil with Mr Markle deciding to stay put at home. Mr Markle allegedly sold the paparazzi snaps - showing him going to shops and fast food restaurants - for \u0026pound100,000, and admitted to TMZ that he was paid for the images.     It was claimed Harry is blaming himself after Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, reportedly pulled out of the wedding.  Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father, and has reportedly begged him to change his mind and walk her down the aisle as planned in front of 600 guests and a TV audience of millions. Harry and Meghan released a statement Monday night to address reports that Mr Markle wouldn\u0027t attend the ceremony.  A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation. In an interview with TMZ, Mr Markle called out his oldest daughter, Meghan\u0027s estranged half-sister Samantha Markle, who has criticised the Suits actress and claimed she was to blame for the paparazzi controversy. He added: I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.  The pensioner, who lives in the Pacific coastal city of Rosarito, Mexico, fears he will suffer a third heart attack, it was claimed.  Piers Morgan lashed out at Samantha Markle for being a media vulture in a furious tirade on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday.  He was left fuming when Meghan\u0027s sister tried to blame the media for her father\u0027s troubles. Samantha, who suffers from MS, has claimed she wasn\u0027t invited to divorcee Meghan\u0027s first wedding - on a beach in Jamaica - because of her wheelchair.  The 53-year-old revealed she hasn\u0027t spoken to her sister since 2015.  She has also previously blasted the royal wedding guest list by claiming that she had shunned her own family in favour of thousands of complete strangers.  Meghan\u0027s estranged half-brother Thomas Markle Jnr, 50, wrote an open letter begging to be invited to the wedding, despite telling Harry to call it off.

Mary Crumpton, 44, lives with legal husband Tim and boyfriend John Hulls, 53, who she unofficially wed during a \u0027commitment ceremony\u0027 at the Unitarian Church in Chorlton, Manchester, earlier this month. The 44-year-old has two more boyfriends - Michael, 63, and 73-year-old James - who live just down the road. Mary was walked up the aisle by her 43-year-old husband. The second-time bride wore a white dress and celebrated with family and friends at a 100-strong reception. The 44-year-old last month spoke publicly about her relationships in the hope of allowing others to understand people who follow the practice polyamory. She told the Sun: It was a lovely day. Tim said a few words to bless mine and John\u0027s commitment to one another. We couldn\u0027t sign legal documents as polygamy is illegal in this country but in all other respects the ceremony was conducted like a normal wedding. Polyamory is having more than one relationship and is different from having more than one spouse.   Polyamorous couple reveal what it\u0027s really like to be in a marriage with three people  Speaking last month, Mary said: I was brought up in quite a traditional home. I had boyfriends and was monogamous. Having more than one partner never crossed my mind. In my twenties I got married and settled down in Chorlton fully intending to be with my husband for life. At the time I didn’t really question having just one partner. It was normal. I did sometimes have feelings for other people, but I felt guilty about doing so and just took it as a sign that I didn’t love my husband enough. When the marriage didn’t work out, I met someone else, and started a monogamous relationship with him. The idea that loving more than one person might not make me a terrible human being only dawned on me when, at a pub, I bumped into a person who had more than one partner. I had never come across it before, or the term ‘polyamory’ which means ‘more-than-one love’. I was quite shocked, and curious about how it all worked for them. My partner was with me when I met the polyamorous person, and he was curious about it too. At the time neither of us considered it for ourselves, but I think the seed had been planted. A couple of years later, in 2003, I suggested to him that perhaps we might try an open relationship. I was interested to explore the possibility of allowing myself to love more than one person. I think for him it was more about the thought of more than one sexual partner. We were both curious to see how it could work for us. I took to it immediately. I had a friend that I was already close to and that friendship drifted very naturally into something more. My partner had a similar experience with a friend of his. It was a revelation to me. I quickly realised that I had been ‘wired up’ this way probably all my life - loving more than one person now seems like the most natural thing in the world to me and I can’t imagine being any other way. For me, it is all about love. Of course, some of my relationships have been sexual, but sex is not the driving force for me.  She continued: I am no longer with the partner that I first explored polyamory with, though he and I remain close friends, and he has continued to be polyamorous. I married one of the people I first dated polyamorously. My husband, Tim, who is 43, and I got together in 2004 and were married in 2013 at Manchester Museum under the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I have a partner, John, 53, who I have been with since 2011, and who I am planning to ‘marry’ this year. We can’t legally marry, but we are having a full wedding-style commitment ceremony at Chorlton Unitarian church in May. Both men are straight and have been brought together through Mary. They have all lived together since 2015. Mary has another two other partners, Michael, 63, who she has been with since 2016 and James, 73.  Mary said: John has been living with me and my husband in our house in Chorlton since 2015. He has a flat a few streets away from my house and I usually stay over at his place once or twice a week, and sometimes he stays at mine. Michael spent Christmas with us and we had a really special day together. Last but not least, I am with James, 73, who I bonded with while watching football games in the pub together in 2015. My husband and John have no interest in football, so it is nice to have someone to share that interest with. One of the lovely things about a life with more than one partner is that there is no pressure on one person to supply all my needs. My husband Tim and I share an enthusiasm for environmentalism and all that entails, like electric cars, and veganism. With my fianc\u0026eacute John I enjoy watching science-fiction and we go to church together. With Michael, I like to watch and support him playing for his local darts team at the Royal Oak, and we go to karaoke nights - which is possibly more embarrassing than admitting to polyamory. Living in a house with more than one partner is something I have done for a number of years now. I suppose in many ways it is no different from living in a shared house with a group of friends, or family. All the usual things about whose turn it is to wash up etc. Tim and John get on well, I suppose a bit like brothers, going on bicycle rides together for example. So it seems to work okay. They have something in common in that they both love me of course, and friends joke that I need two of them to keep me in-line. Like in any relationship, insecurities can arise. Though in some ways there is less jealousy perhaps - no fear that a partner might cheat on me because why lie about it when having another partner is allowed anyway? Sometimes there might be a fear that a new partner is ‘better’ in some way than a current one, but good communication and offering reassurances allows that to be dealt with.  In many ways I have found that being in open relationships has forced me to communicate much better. I am very honest and open with my partners about my feelings and needs, in a way that I didn’t have the courage to be in previous monogamous relationships. So I think I have grown as a person, and have better and stronger relationships now. Of course, all of that is possible in monogamous relationships, and I am not suggesting polyamory is in any way better, just different. But it works well for me personally. I don’t have children, and have no desire to have children. I see no problem with bringing children into a polyamorous set-up though, because I have seen co-parenting work really well for other polyamorous groups. It is not something we plan though. Mostly people have been great. They had lots of questions about it, and some family members needed reassurance that we were all happy and no-one was getting hurt. I find that I have a huge capacity for romantic love. I just naturally fall in love with more than one person at a time. So to settle down with just one person for the rest of my life just doesn’t feel natural to me. People sometimes ask me if it means that I love my husband, or any of my partners less. And I say no. Perhaps it is a bit like how we love our children - when a parent has a second or third child, it doesn’t mean that they love their first child any the less. I think that romantic love is unlimited too. Time is limited of course. But I do not believe that love is. It certainly isn’t for me. I get different reactions. Most people are interested and people often say ‘I wish my wife/husband would let me do that’. I sometimes get negative reactions too - I have been called a slapper or a slag. I think that negativity mostly arises because I am doing something a bit different and sometimes that can make people feel uncomfortable.

It was expected that Thomas Markle would walk her down the aisle on Saturday at the Royal wedding .   However, the lighting director is still over 5000 miles away from Windsor and claimed he no longer plans to travel to the UK to give her away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi .  The question now remains - who will walk Meghan down the aisle?  While there was talk of Prince William doing the honours, it was initially thought that Meghan\u0027s mum, Doria Ragland would assume this role.   The actor has frequently paid tribute to her, and it was Doria who largely raised Meghan after her divorce. Now, bookmaker Ladbrokes are offering odds of 4.6 that Doria will walk her down the aisle. If Meghan does choose to go down this route, then she wouldn\u0027t be the first member of the Royal family.  In fact, she\u0027d be following in some pretty big footsteps.

Catherine Mayer, author of Charles: The Heart of a King , interviewed various members of the prince\u0027s inner circle who revealed the turmoil he was in the night before his wedding.

Neighbours had blocked off all escape routes with their cars. It was like the A-Team, they all jumped into action. One of the neighbours saw him in a garden and grabbed him. The resident added: I was amazed how the local community were so quick to help each other, it\u0027s not something you see a lot these days.  Bally Sohal, who runs the Park Hall Street Watch committee, highlighted the importance of such community groups. He said: Because it\u0027s a Saturday and because of the commotion, everybody\u0027s come out and that just shows you the strength of the whole thing, because everybody\u0027s come out to help today. In a message to the neighbourhood watch group PCSO Tim Littlehales said: At approximately 2.30pm on Saturday, 12th May, a burglary took place on Birmingham Road past the lights by the Bell pub.

Mum-of-four Cherise Gwilt was out for a shopping trip in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, with two of her children when she went into labour. The 43-year-old was having contractions and her children were panicking when the driver told her she would have to pay \u0026pound40 on top of the \u0026pound4.60 fare. Cherise gave birth three hours later, and her partner says the way she was treated was disgusting.  But taxi firm Lucky Seven has now pledged to reimburse Cherise after blaming the incident on a miscommunication, saying the driver thought she had urinated in the back seat, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.   Cherise had to send her 12-year-old son to withdraw \u0026pound40 from a cash machine after telling the driver that her waters had broken during the incident on Thursday afternoon. She was taken to hospital by ambulance - and gave birth to little Dottie Mai less than three hours later. Cherise, of Abbey Hulton, suggested the incident has tarnished the memory of her daughter\u0027s birth. She said: When the taxi pulled up outside Poundstretcher my waters broke as I was getting out of the car. The driver told me I would have to pay more but I was having contractions and my children were panicking.  I sent my son to the cash machine and the taxi driver took the money. I had to wait for someone and my partner ended up arriving just before the ambulance. It was absolutely horrendous and when you have a baby you have this idea of what it will be like. People look back on the birth of their children and it is nice but this is a touchy subject because of what happened just hours earlier. Partner Martin Hyson, who met Cherise after the incident, said the way she was treated was disgusting.

When she stepped out the carriage and walked up St Paul\u0027s Cathedral\u0027s stairs with the huge train behind her, the world was in awe of its beauty. But there was one person who wasn’t happy when she first saw the dress - the woman who designed and made it. Elizabeth Emanuel and her husband spent months creating the stunning ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown. The dress reportedly cost \u0026pound9,000 at the time, and featured puffed sleeves and more then 10,000 pearls.  Speaking during ITV\u0027s Invitation to the Royal Wedding, Elizabeth admitted being horrified when she saw how creased Diana\u0027s dress had become. She said: We did know it would crease a bit but when I saw her arrive at St Paul\u0027s and we saw the creasing I actually felt faint. I was horrified, really, because it was quite a lot of creasing.  It was a lot more than we thought. They had done a dress rehearsal but using a different material, and it wasn\u0027t anywhere near as bad. But she now says that looking back, that moment was actually her favourite shot of the Princess in the dress, comparing it to a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon and becoming a butterfly.

Student Lucy White, 24, suffered a seizure caused by a toxic mix of cocaine and prescription drugs in her system. The seizure starved her brain of oxygen for more than 40 minutes as her partner cooked dinner in the next room. Lucy\u0027s older sister Stacey Jordan, 28, rushed to her bedside - finding her hooked up to wires and tubes - after receiving a terrible phone call in the middle of the night of May 3. Stacey has now shared the heart-wrenching photos of the top marks criminology student to warn others about the dangers of drugs.  Her social media post went viral with more than 200,000 likes and shares as Stacey bravely told the world her sister, who had previously volunteered for drugs charities, was dead and had donated her organs on May 7. She included pictures of a deeply personal letter Lucy had written to her last summer in which she thanked her for always being there and vowed to repay her one day. Stacey said: Anyone would say she was like a sunshine - her hair was bright blonde, and she was always smiling. She used to be terrified of getting into trouble. She didn\u0027t even drink that much. I can\u0027t believe it. She tried to make a difference in everyone\u0027s life, she helped everybody - and she was just happy.  I hate what has happened so much. She was clever, and she had everything going for her until, obviously, she didn\u0027t. Lucy, who was studying at the University of the West of England, was looking forward to getting her degree in the summer and had volunteered with the Bristol Drugs Project to help recovering addicts get clean. But after getting involved with the wrong crowd and finding herself dabbling in drugs, she suddenly dropped out of university and lost contact with many of her closest friends and family in January. Stacey claims doctors told her tests confirmed Lucy had taken cocaine and powerful prescription drug pregabalin when she suffered a seizure. She collapsed at home while partner Ian O\u0027Donoghue was cooking a pie in the next room. He called the ambulance and started CPR. Despite being rushed to intensive care at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, Lucy tragically died four days later.  Stacey, a security officer, said: I got a call in the middle of the night and it was just my nan screaming down the phone saying \u0027It\u0027s Lucy, it\u0027s Lucy, she\u0027s nearly died\u0027. When I got there, the doctor said a 24-year-old doesn\u0027t just collapse and have a seizure for no reason, she must have taken something. The doctors first said that she\u0027s going to be severely brain damaged, and then they said they thought she was brain stem dead. Once you\u0027re brain stem dead there\u0027s no reversal from that, there\u0027s no getting better, it\u0027s just that. When the tests confirmed it, I wanted to spend the last of her time here with her on my own. I just sat by her bedside and held her hand. According to Stacey, Lucy fell in with the wrong crowd in May last year when peer pressure, anxiety and loneliness during the summer drove her to cocaine and her life spun out of control.  Stacey, from Bristol, said: I got a message from her ex-boyfriend who told me she had started taking drugs and he was really worried about her. Lucy and I were about to go on holiday together, so I decided to wait until we were there to confront her. I hadn\u0027t seen her in a while - obviously she didn\u0027t want me to see her - and she looked like an absolute mess. She had lost so much weight and she was so skinny. She usually has her eyebrows, lashes and nails done, but she didn\u0027t look right. I just said to her \u0027I know everything, you need to tell me now\u0027 and she started crying and couldn\u0027t breathe. She said she was sorry that she didn\u0027t tell me, and I was furious, but I basically said \u0027I\u0027m going to help you, but you\u0027ve got to help yourself\u0027. I told her I\u0027d help her get clean but that she had to stay away from the people taking drugs.

Preparations are already well under way in Windsor with the big Royal Wedding just four days away - as the world\u0027s media descends for an event like no other in living memory. Shop windows are perfecting their displays and memorabilia collections before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel in the town on Saturday. People are decorating their homes to get into the party spirit - with one house in the area already repainted in red, white and blue - and one pub has even renamed itself \u0027The Prince Harry\u0027 in honour of the occasion. Last minute preparations are also being made at The Long Walk, Windsor Great Park. And memorabilia sellers are already pitching up outside Windsor Castle.  Stephanie Methven, owner of Limes Dine In Bakery in Windsor, said a party atmosphere is building in the town. We\u0027re anticipating as the week goes on, it gradually getting busier and busier day by day, she said. Ms Methven, 32, said they are simplifying their menu come Friday in order to cope with the crowds. We\u0027ll still run all of our lovely scones and cakes, and of course our special elderflower and lemon cake as well, she said. Ms Methven said the Harry and Meghan cake, baked by her and her mother, has been the most popular cake over the past fortnight. She said the cake is loved by tourists and locals alike as they get in the mood for the big day. Meanwhile a TV station has been set up on the roof of a building by Windsor Castle, while media tents are also present in the grounds. Meghan and Harry will travel through Windsor Town, returning to Windsor Castle along the Long Walk, escorted by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. Afterwards there will be a reception at St George’s Hall for the couple and guests from the congregation. About 100,000 fans are expected to visit Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royal couple, so shops have made sure they\u0027re sufficiently stocked up. KFC are even launching a limited-edition bucket to celebrate.  Just 50 of the specially designed buckets are being created and will be available exclusively from KFC’s Windsor restaurant on Dedworth Road on the wedding day itself- and it\u0027ll be first come first served. Pub bosses up and down the country are anticipating the busiest day of the year in what is being dubbed ‘Super Saturday,’ as punters are expected to head to their local pubs in droves and celebrate the Royal Wedding and the FA Cup Final. Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars predict more than 1,000 pints a second will be poured on Saturday 19th May. And with broadcast coverage of the Royal Wedding starting from as early 9.30am, patriotic punters are expected to head to their locals earlier than normal to grab a front row seat.  The Met Office say the latest forecast for Windsor on Saturday is almost perfect for the crowds gathering to watch Harry, 33, and American actress Meghan, 36, tie the knot. Deputy Chef Meteorologist Chris Tubbs said: “We expect some warm, sunny spells, although, at this early stage, there is some uncertainty about just how much cloud we can expect during the day. “Early temperature forecasts suggest that the day will start rather cool, with an early morning temperature of around 6C, so anyone who arrives early to get a good place in the crowd will need to wear something warm. “The maximum temperature in Windsor on Saturday will be around 20C, compared to an average for the time of year of around 17C”.

Dakota Pitts walked into school with his dad\u0027s badge proudly around his neck as dozens of his father\u0027s colleagues lined up to support him. Moving footage shows Dakota making his way to the door of Sullivan Elementary School in Indiana while officers watch on. Afterwards, the cops gave him gifts and promised they would always have his back. Earlier this month, his dad Rob Pitts was tragically killed, aged 45, during a shootout with a suspect.   Les Ham, Terre Haute Police Department detective, told WTHI-TV : Dakota asked his mum if one of his dad\u0027s friends could take him to school, so she kind of reached out to Rob\u0027s friends and family.  Officer Pitts\u0027 sister, Kelli Jones, added: He will definitely know that his dad was a hero. Blood doesn\u0027t always make family, and I think the blue family just went above and beyond. The 45-year-old also leaves behind another son and daughter. He was killed during a shootout at an apartment complex where an armed murder suspect had barricaded himself.  The 45-year-old was hit after suspect Christopher Wolfe, 21, opened fire from the second floor of the building. He was rushed to hospital but later died of his injuries.

This is a little embarrassing, however we thought it wise to bring it to your attention, the note began.

It was very difficult to explain to my young granddaughter the noises coming from your bedroom at the side of your house next to the path.

Kris Kacprzak and 15 other parachutists had made a scheduled jump from the small plane just minutes before it went down. His son Kacper stayed on board with pilot Neil \u0027Billy\u0027 Bowditch and both were killed in the tragedy in Co Offaly, Ireland. Mr Kacprzak, from Dublin, ran more than half a mile to the boggy site after witnessing the crash and desperately tried to dig out his son, the Irish Mirror reports.  A source close to the Irish Parachute Club told the Irish Daily Mail that the tragedy was unfolding by the time Mr Kacprzak had safely landed on the ground after jumping from the light aircraft. The plane went down on bog land in the Irish midlands on Sunday afternoon. The source said: Kris made the jump from the plane and by the time he landed, this terrible tragedy was unfolding. Kris dug with his bare hands during the recovery operation as we battled to save them.  Kris is something of a skydive enthusiast and Kacper loved his father. He loved planes and I have no doubt as he grew up would have loved to be up there with his dad. The source added: The pilot was a very well respected and experienced pilot from the UK. We have no idea what could have happened but it is very much tragedy for both families and for us as a wider community. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page has been set up by Allaiouti Hassan, a friend of the Kacprzaks, to help both grieving families.

Footage of their bizarre find was posted to YouTube channel Explore With Us, and initially showed them walking around the rural camp. The derelict site in an unknown location shows vehicles left to rot and buildings crumbling to the ground. As the explorers continue their walk through the eerie site, they enter a tiny one-room building, before making their disturbing discovery. A metal shelving unit covering the back wall is pulled away, revealing a huge hole ripped in the wall behind - leading to the hidden room. The man filming the bizarre scene instructs another member of the team to investigate the contents of two tubs placed on shelving inside the room.  They then discover the tubs are filled with bullets before going on to film images of \u0027weird\u0027 cartoons and hardcore pornography stuck to the walls. The team then find ropes and bottles of alcohol littering the floor. While it\u0027s not known where the site is located, many viewers online said it seemed a great distance from any other signs of civilisation. Lance Shank said: That place is crazy. Whoever lived out there must\u0027ve been one hell of a person and probably not very welcoming to live out there with a watch out tower and surveillance cameras.  Other online viewers urged the explorers to call the police and report what they found. Paisley Campbell said: You should tell the police. Tell them you were hiking around and found this place..make an anonymous call So many lost and missing women and children in this country. Others had more rational explanations for the creepy site, suggesting it could have been a base for miners.

Criminologists have long known that many murderers share the same personality characteristics. But do those murderers also share the same star sign? David Jester, the British author, spent two years researching the zodiac signs of some of the most prolific or notorious serial killers on both sides of the pond to find out. Jester, whose new thriller The Clinic hits the shelves this week, found that more killers on his list were Taureans - born between April 20 and May 20 - than any other star sign.  He also discovered that April 24 and February 18 stand out as two of the days on which the most killers were born. We’ll leave it to you to decide if there really is a connection or if birthdays and star signs are just a co-incidence. But if you have a Taurean friend acting a little suspiciously…keep an eye on them. Serial killers, broken down by birthdays, are: Aquarius (born January 20 to February 18)  Aquarians don’t like broken promises. It can anger them when someone promises one thing and delivers another. They have a severe distaste for people who are boring and they are always looking for excitement. Might this explain those killers who lash out and kill for fun? Aquarian serial killers include:  Gary Ridgway (Born February 18, 1949): One of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, with a kill count that is said to be the country’s highest. Also known as the Green River Killer. Lee Boyd Malvo (Born February 18, 1985) David Birnie (Born February 16, 1951) Joel Rifkin (Born January 20, 1959) John Bodkin Adams (Born January 21, 1899) Luis Alfredo Garavito (Born January 25, 1957): Known as “The Beast”, Garavito is one of the most prolific serial killers in history, admitting to the rare, torture and murder of nearly 150 boys and suspected of killing over 400.  Pisces (born February 19 to March 20)  Pisceans don’t like being alone and hate being criticised. They are compassionate and artistic, but the same has been said for many serial killers. So, which serial killers have the Pisces zodiac sign? Let’s take a look:  Aileen Wuornos (Born February 29, 1956): An angry woman who had many issues in her past. She killed several men, seemingly without remorse. John Wayne Gacy (Born March 17, 1942): A killer who dressed as a clown. He certainly seemed to be artistic, but compassionate he was not. Dennis Radar (Born March 9, 1945): A family man who got away with his crimes for many years. He was caught because of his desire to be infamous and to toy with police. Also known as BTK, or “Bind. Torture. Kill.” Stephen Port (Born February 22, 1975) Robert Napper (Born February 25, 1966) Colin Ireland (Born March 16, 1954) Peter Manuel (Born March 13, 1927): A Scottish serial killer. Doug Clark (Born March 10, 1948)  Aries (born March 21 to April 19)  They are determined and confident, but they can also be short-temper and impulsive. They are leaders who enjoy challenges and may see themselves as the strongest, best and most capable, traits that can be very useful and can lead to success in all walks of life, but ones that can also have a dark side. Arians on this list include:  Alexander Pichushkin (Born April 9, 1974): A Russian serial killer who is said to have killed as many as 60 people. John Reginald Christie (Born April 8, 1899): An infamous serial killer who was active during the 1940s and 1950s. Herbert Mullin (Born April 18, 1947) Henri Desire Landru (Born April 12, 1869) Judy Buenoana (Born April 4, 1943)  Taurus (born April 20 to May 20) Although reliable, Taureans can also be stubborn and possessive. They don’t like anything too complicated, they despise insecurities and they don’t do well with changes. They are devoted, patient and hard-working, traits which can make for a great personality in someone who is stable and good-natured, and an evil manipulator in someone who is not.  H. H. Holmes (Born May 16, 1861): Said to be America’s first modern serial killer, Holmes created a murder castle and was almost ingenious in his unspeakable evil. An intelligent, devious man who chased money more than anything else. Michael Ryan (Born May 18, 1960): The man behind The Hungerford Massacre. He armed himself with assault rifles and launched an attack on his sleepy, suburban community, before killing himself. David Copeland (Born May 15, 1976): Known as the London Nail Bomber, Copeland was your average Neo-Nazi scum who made it his mission to kill and maim anyone who wasn’t as white and as crazy as he was. Karla Homolka (Born May 4, 1970): A Canadian serial killer who raped and murdered several children along with her husband. Albert Fish (Born May 19, 1870): One of the most well-known serial killers in the US, his nicknames included The Gray Man and Werewolf of Wysteria. A real-life Bogey Man, Fish was a child rapist and a cannibal. If this serial killer birthday matches yours, then you’re entitled to feel a little sick right now. Levi Bellfield (Born May 17, 1968): A child killer and rapist in the United Kingdom. Orville Lynn Majors (Born April 24 1961): Robert Black (Born April 21, 1947): A Scottish serial killer and paedophile. Steve Wright (Born April 24 1958): An English serial killer who raped and murdered several women. Martha Beck (Born, May 6, 1920)  Gemini (born May 21 to June 20)  The Gemini is thought to be nervous and gentle, traits you wouldn’t expect to see in a serial killer. Far from being loners, they tend not to like being alone. They also hate being confined and don’t work well with routine, always seeking something different. Their adaptability can help them to fit into any new environment and social circle, which means they can hide any dark side better than most.  David Berkowitz (Born June 1, 1953): Also known as the Son of Sam. A loner who shot multiple people, apparently because he worshipped Satan, but mainly because he had a few screws loose. Jeffrey Dahmer (Born May 21, 1960): The stereotypical serial killer. He was a loner, he abused animals as a child, and he performed unspeakable acts on living and dead victims. Peter Sutcliffe (Born June 2, 1946): Better known as The Yorkshire Ripper. He killed prostitutes in 1970s England because of what was described as a “severe distaste for women”. Richard Chase (Born May 23, 1950) Ted Kaczynski (Born May 22, 1942): Also known as the Unabomber, an American terrorist. Trevor Hardy (Born June 11, 1945)  Cancer (born June 21 to July 22)  Cancerians do not like it when someone criticizes them or the ones they love. They can also be very moody and tenacious. This makes them more prone to lashing out. If you believe in astrology then you might expect this to be one of the main zodiac signs for serial killers. However, we could find very few that serial killers with Cancer as a zodiac sign, none of which were particularly infamous or well known.  Robert Maudsley (Born June 26, 1953): Responsible for the death of 4 people, three of which he killed while he was in prison for the first murder.  Leo (born July 23 to August 22)  We often see serial killers as arrogant, struggling to grasp reality. They don’t like being treated like they are not the most important person in the room. Well, these are also traits that you will find associated with Leo. So, does that mean this is a zodiac sign that many serial killers have?  Myra Hindley (Born July 23, 1942): One of the most infamous female serial killers in the history of the UK. Raymond Morris (Born August 13, 1929) John George Haigh (Born July 24, 1909) Anatoly Onoprienko (Born July 25, 1959): Active in Ukraine and known as Citizen O. One of the world’s worst serial killers based on the number of victims he claimed.  Virgo (born August 23 to September 22)  Many serial killers begin by torturing animals, but one of the traits of Virgo is a love of animals. However, they are also known to be rude and they dislike asking for help, believing that they can go it alone. There is a certain perfectionism associated with them as well, which is something that we often see portrayed in serial killers on the silver screen and in books. But what about real life? Is this one of the main zodiac signs of serial killers?  Ed Gein (Born August 26, 1906): A loner who the Psycho film was based on. He kept skin from his victims and used it to adorn his home and create a suit of skin. Henry Lee Lucas (Born August 23, 1936): Convicted of around a dozen, confessed to many more, but is known to have lied about the majority of these. Peter Tobin (Born August 27, 1946): A convicted serial killer and sex offender who was active between 1991 and 2006. He was born in Johnstone, Scotland, and was imprisoned in Edinburgh. Rodney Alcala (Born August 23, 1943): Was convicted of killing five people in California during the 1970s. Albert DeSalvo (Born September 3, 1931): Better known as the Boston Strangler, he is one of the better-known serial killers in the United States. Hs confession was disputed, and many believed he didn’t do it, but a DNA test performed in 2013 found that there was a 99.9% chance he did. DeSalvo escaped prison the first time and after being caught and taken to a maximum-security prison, he was murdered by another inmate.  Libra (born September 23 to October 22)  Often considered gentle and caring, with a severe distaste for violence, the Libra does not look like someone who would kill, let alone kill multiple times. So, if there was any connection between zodiac signs and serial killers then this would be a good astrological sign to research.  Fred West (Born September 29, 1941): A man who murdered alongside his wife and was known to torture and kill young girls, including his own children. One of the worst serial killers, ever. Beverley Allitt (Born October 4, 1968)  Scorpio (born October 23 to November 21)  Seen as truthful but stubborn, Scorpios can also get very jealous. They are brave, but they can be violent, resourceful and secretive, which are traits you wouldn’t be surprised to find in serial killers.  Moses Sithole (Born November 17, 1964): A deranged serial killer, he was definitely violent and secretive. Robert Pickton (Born October 24, 1949) Fritz Haarman (Born October 25, 1879)  Sagittarius (born November 22 to December 21)  Sagittarians like to be free. They love to travel, see the world. But the same could be said for many killers who have done their bidding in far off corners of the globe. Their love of outdoors can make them strong and independent, while their distaste for clingy people could make them a little less compassionate and empathetic.  Dennis Nilsen (Born November 23, 1945): A British serial killer who targeted young gay men he knew no one would miss, before burning or flushing his victims. Ted Bundy (Born November 24, 1946): A charismatic serial killer who killed many young women and then defended himself in court. He was sentenced to death for his crimes. Rose West (Born November 29, 1953): The wife of Fred West, a woman who mirrored his sickening evil and helped him to kill young girls. Derrick Bird (Born November 27, 1957) Edward Kemper (Born December 18, 1948) Ray Fernandez (Born December 17, 1914)  Capricorn (born December 22 to January 19) "},{"url":null,"title":"horror one tonne bull tramples","story":"NewsHorror as one-tonne bull tramples champion cowboy to death just seconds after entering the ringWARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Giliard Antonio died from severe internal injuries after being violently trampled as he prepared to compete in the US\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJanet Tappin Coelho09:24, 15 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA champion rodeo rider has died after being violently trampled by a bull just seconds after entering the ring. Cowboy Giliard Antonio, one of the best riders in Brazil, suffered severe internal injuries just two weeks after returning to the sport following a year-long injury lay-off. The experienced rider suffered the brutal injuries after his hand became stuck in his harness as the bucking animal stomped on his chest. The incident happened before a packed stadium in the 46th Maring\u0026aacute Agricultural and Commercial Trade Fair staged in south Brazil. Concerned commentators called for urgent medical assistance as the rodeo rider stumbled to his feet, stood shakily for a few minutes then collapsed losing consciousness.  Paramedics spent 40 minutes trying to revive him in an ambulance, but he was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Images of the shocking moment were released by organisers, the Professional Bull Riders of Brazil (PBR), and the Maringa Rural Society. The clip shows Antonio staying on top of his one-tonne mount for almost eight seconds before losing control. After falling the cowboy tries to stand up and is rescued by a rodeo-hand but passes out shortly afterwards from his injuries. The married father with a one-year-old daughter was regarded as an elite competitor.  He had won several titles over the years, led the championships in 2016 and was preparing to compete in the United States. A fortnight ago he returned to the bare-back sport after receiving medical clearance following injuries to pelvic floor muscles which had laid him off for 14 months. He was confined to a wheelchair for a while during his recovery and according to friends was ‘rearing’ to return to the adrenalin-driven contest, which he loved.

The leader of the Kremlin has previously said that the 12-mile link is a dream of the tsars and Stalin but has only happened under his rule.  The project, which has cost a staggering \u0026pound2.75 billion, has led to a wave of sanctions from the EU and US. But as he opened the controversial new structure today, which has been dubbed by some as Putin\u0027s Bridge, the Russian President remarked that he is sure people will \u0027love it\u0027. He added: I genuinely congratulate you on this historic holiday, historic because in different epochs, under the tsar-father, people dreamed about building this bridge. Finally thanks to your talent and work, this project, this wonder, has been completed  After the inspection today, the first regular traffic will cross the Crimea Bridge at 5.30 am tomorrow. Ukraine has slammed the construction by the “the Russian occupation forces”. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 after the toppling of pro-Moscow Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev. The bridge spans a treacherous strait between the Black and Azov seas, and gives a key link to the Russian mainland.  A rail crossing is due to be completed late next year. Putin said previously of the “mighty” bridge: This is a project that they tried to achieve back under the tsar. “Then in the 1930s they tried to do it -- they also couldn\u0027t. And they tried later -- nothing worked out.  “But we managed it. That\u0027s great.” He added it is “a unique structure not just for our country but I think that in the whole world there are few similar”. Heavy vehicles have already been driven across the bridge in preparation for Putin\u0027s arrival, although approach highways are not yet complete.  However, there is still a concern in Russia over security. Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov has warned: “We are constantly expecting provocations from Ukraine but believe me, we are highly ready to resist any attacks.” He vowed: “The professional readiness of the FSB, police, and Russian National Guards is high. “Nothing can be excluded with this kind of power in Kiev.  “They are fully dependent on Americans, they do not think about consequences for Ukraine. “At first they said that there won’t be any Crimean bridge, now they are talking some nonsense that they will block the movement on the bridge.” Ukrainian businessman Lenur Islyamov called for all cars using the bridge to be logged and sanctions imposed on each driver. “I do not know how to do it but I am convinced that if Ukraine cannot stop the movement on the bridge, at least all transport should be registered that goes from Russia to occupied Crimea. “Everyone must be located, name by name.

That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach buses face severe disruption after underground explosion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn \u0026#8220underground explosion\u0026#8221 has caused delays on Stagecoach bus services.Police were called to Dunfermline bus station after 12pm following the incident.It\u0026#8217s believed a cover burst off a drain close to the entrance of the station.A cordon has been set up with pedestrians being guided away from the area.Stagecoach said that some of its services are \u0026#8220severely delayed\u0026#8221 because of the incident.They tweeted:\u0026mdash Stagecoach East Scot (@StagecoachEScot) May 15, 2018More soon\u0026#8230\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af9568d73aaf-846x564.jpg ","title":"starbucks reveals new dundee drive thru opening date","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe opening date for a new drive-through coffee shop on the Kingsway is less than two months away.The company has announced a Starbucks will open at the edge of the West Gourdie Industrial Estate at the end of June, creating 25 new jobs.Construction group Kilmac, which has built the outlet, claims it is the second “American-style” drive-through of its kind under the Starbucks brand in Scotland.A spokeswoman for Starbucks told the Tele the branch would be operated through East Lothian-based franchisee, Burton \u0026amp Speke.She said: “We are delighted to confirm that we will be opening a new Starbucks Drive Thru store, in partnership with Burton \u0026amp Speke, at Kingsway West in Dundee at the end of June.“The new store team of 25 partners (employees) will be recruited locally and we’re looking forward to bringing our quality coffee to the local community.”Starbucks is one of two operators to have committed to the £4.5 million development on the city’s edge alongside national pub/restaurant chain Marstons.Richard Kilcullen, director of Kilmac, said last year that the Starbucks project would be a “feather in Dundee’s cap”.Today, he said the coffee shop giant had been so pleased with the build – Kilmac’s first in Dundee – that it is in discussions with the firm to work on more projects down the line.“We were really happy with how quickly we were able to get the project going, with the help of Dundee City Council, and the fact we got it built in 12 weeks,” he said.“We also have the project for Marstons, and I believe they are finishing off their design now.“On the back of the Starbucks build we are discussing developing more projects with them in future.”The West Gourdie development is one of several in the works along Dundee’s ring road.A plan to develop a small retail park at Kingsway East on the former site of the ABB Nitran factory was approved by city councillors in June last year.The development will feature a Lidl supermarket, another drive-through coffee shop linked with Starbucks rival Costa and other retail and industrial units.A provisional opening date of March 2020 has been set for the Lidl store.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af955efd6057.jpg ","title":"verdant works retains its five star visitscotland rating","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVerdant Works, the world-class visitor attraction which tells the story of Dundee’s industrial textile heritage, has retained its five-star rating from VisitScotland.The renewal of the top award secures Dundee Heritage Trust’s unique position as the only independent charity in Scotland operating two five-star museums.

Clearly the show is very much about farming and we still have all the different classes and it\u0027 very much a competition for the farming fraternity.\u0026ldquoHowever, to make the event sustainable we have had to diversify and introduce new attractions \u0026ndash often still with a farming theme, but that appeal to those who have little or no farming background at all.Music will also play a big part in this year\u0027 event with live music to suit all tastes all day in the bar marquee.Monster trucks Big Pete and the Grim Reaper will take to the main arena to wow the crowds. There will also be the more traditional but ever-popular livestock parade and vintage tractor show plus local food, drink and craft.

Mr Hendry branded it the \u0026ldquoworst kind of postcode lottery and asked the Department of Work and Pensions minister to make urgent changes.And he also called on the minister to follow the Scottish government\u0027 lead and remove the legal definition of terminal illness, currently set at six months by the UK government.\u0026ldquoUnder existing UK government rules, people with conditions such as terminal heart failure, motor neurone disease and other terminal conditions need to apply for social security in the usual way and are subject to the normal assessments, including work assessments.\u0026ldquoThey are quite simply not considered terminal enough \u0026ndash this policy exposes a Tory government at its very worst and they are wilfully failing families dealing with the trauma of terminal illness.\u0026ldquoPeople who are dying should not be forced to go to appointments with work coaches, nor should they have to spend their last month\u0027 fighting for much needed financial support.\u0026ldquoEven those who fall under the UK government\u0027 \u0026lsquosix months to live\u0026rsquo definition are subjected to heart-breaking waits for their financial support.Tuesday 15 May 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
