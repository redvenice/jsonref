Last night, the PM said he had raised human rights with the leader.But he added: \u0027We also talked about what we can do to stabilise oil prices, to fight inflation, to help consumers, to help people at the gas pumps, at the petrol pumps, and a lot of agreement that it is important to avoid inflation, to avoid the damaging economic consequences, agreement that we need to work together to bring peace to Ukraine.\u0027The PM was asked whether states like Saudi Arabia who are members of the oil producers\u0027 cartel Opec understood the importance of increasing supplies at a time when the West is trying to wean itself off Russian oil and gas.He replied: \u0027There\u0027s an interest for Saudi Arabia, for all oil-producing and exporting countries, in making sure that the global economy is not damaged by the current spikes, that we don\u0027t get the kind of inflation that we saw in the 1970s, we don\u0027t see the stagflation. So it was a very productive conversation.\u0027But pressed on if he had won a decision on increasing supply to reduce the shock of the West moving away from Russian fuel, he said: \u0027I think you need to talk to the Saudis about that.\u0027Mr Johnson, who shook hands with the Saudi crown prince accused of ordering the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, insisted closer ties with the kingdom did not mean \u0027we can\u0027t stick to our principles\u0027.At his first stop in Abu Dhabi, where he met UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Mr Johnson pointed towards Saudi Arabia announcing a £1billion investment in green aviation fuel in Teesside.\u0027That\u0027s the kind of thing we want to encourage - doesn\u0027t in any way mean we can\u0027t stick to our principles and raise those issues that we all care about.\u0027Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of \u0027going cap in hand from dictator to dictator\u0027, which he said was \u0027not an energy strategy\u0027. But he stopped short of saying Labour would boycott Saudi oil.Maya Foa, director of human rights advocacy group Reprieve, said the Saudis\u0027 decision to execute three people while Mr Johnson was visiting was a \u0027provocative act, designed to flaunt the crown prince\u0027s power and impunity to the world\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Russian broadcaster RT s UK licence revoked Ofcom","story":"Share this article Alex Salmond, former First Minister of Scotland, later suspended his talk show after viewers criticised his decision to work with the controversial broadcaster.Mr Salmond had continued broadcasting on the maligned channel right up until Putin launched a full-scale invasion.A statement from the politician released to the media said his show featuring the interview with Vince Cable would be the last until hostilities between Russia and Ukraine come to an end.Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon had said she was \u0027appalled\u0027 at her predecessor Alex Salmond\u0027s involvement with RT. Social media platforms were quick to distance themselves from RT in the wake of Putin\u0027s illegal invasion, with YouTube and Facebook banning access to all RT and Sputnik channels across Europe. Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: \u0027Freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high.\u0027Following an independent regulatory process, we have today found that RT is not fit and proper to hold a licence in the UK.\u0027As a result we have revoked RT\u0027s UK broadcasting licence.\u0027 RT, previously known as Russia Today, is a Russian state-backed news channel, based in the UK.Launched in 2014, it is funded by the federal tax budget of the Russian government.It closed for TV broadcasting on 30 July 2021.

Video: ReutersUS President Joe Biden meets virtually with Micheál Martin in the Oval Office on Thursday. Photograph: by Nicholas Kamm  AFP via Getty ImagesUS President Joe Biden has paid tribute to Ireland’s efforts to accept Ukrainian refugees, describing it as “amazing”.Speaking to Taoiseach Micheál Martin in a virtual bilateral meeting this afternoon, Mr Biden said: “What Ireland is doing now taking in Ukrainian refugees speaks so loudly about your principles . . . It’s amazing and I want to publicly compliment you for it. Thank you. Thank you.”The meeting is taking place virtually after the Taoiseach tested positive for Covid-19 last night, leading to the cancellation of his attendance at today’s St Patrick’s Day events in Washington.It is expected that the Taoiseach will have to remain in the US for the next 10 days, as US regulations prohibit international travel for that period following a positive test.This will mean that Mr Martin will miss next week’s European Council summit in Brussels. In opening remarks, the two men said they would discuss the war in Ukraine, as well as Northern Ireland and other issues. Mr Martin commended President Biden for his leadership of what he described as the “like minded democracies” who had banded together to oppose Russia’s “barbaric attack on the citizens of Ukraine”. He said that Ireland supports the “broadest and widest sanctions as possible”, and said it was “extremely important that we keep this unity of purpose” in seeking to end the “unjustifiable and immoral war”.He said that Russia’s invasion was inflicting “terrible trauma on the children of Ukraine and their mothers”.‘Unequivocal support’In his opening remarks President Biden also reiterated his administration’s “unequivocal support” for the Belfast Agreement. “I’ve made that clear as you probably heard to the prime minister,” he said. “Too much blood, sweat and tears have been shed to get that done, and this is no time to change it.”Later President Biden returned to the same themes when he addressed the Friends of Ireland lunch on Capitol Hill, hosted by Ms Pelosi and attended by the members of the powerful cross-party group. He said that the Belfast Agreement was “truly, truly, truly, truly supported” in the US. “We insist that it be maintained,” he said, to applause.Mr Biden also said that Ireland was “stepping up” in the efforts to isolate Russia and its “murderous dictator, a pure thug, who is waging an immoral war against the Ukraine”. “The Republic is paying a big price for supporting the sanctions,” he said.The President again paid effusive tribute to Ireland and the Irish-American relationship which he said was “more intense than ever before”.In a brief statement issued after the meeting, the Taoiseach’s spokesman said that two men had spoken about “the economy, Brexit and the belfast Agreement, the situation in Ukraine, the undocumented Irish” and that Mr Martin had reiterated the invitation to Mr Biden to visit Ireland.The Taoiseach said he was “feeling good” after his positive Covid test, which he said illustrated the benefit of vaccines. He said the cancellation of the in-person meeting was “unfortunate, but no more than that”. The Taoiseach is isolating at Blair House, a guesthouse for visiting leaders across the road from the White House. He quickly left the Ireland Funds gala dinner on Wednesday night after receiving news of his positive test. Mr Martin had earlier tested negative in routine tests but was retested when a member of the Irish delegation returned a positive result. Officials scrambled throughout the night to save as much of the day’s programme as possible. The St Patrick’s Day lunch on Capitol Hill with Congressional leaders and the White House reception this evening are expected to go ahead, but without Mr Martin.Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said she was “very, very sad” that the Taoiseach would not be joining members of Congress and President Biden for the Friends of Ireland lunch. Ms Pelosi, who sat with the Taoiseach before he left the dinner last night, said she was testing regularly and following medical advice.Meanwhile, President Michael D. Higgins issued a statement sending his good wishes to the Taoiseach after having heard og his positive Covid-19 test.“The Taoiseach has had a gruelling schedule working for our country over recent weeks,” he said. “I know that this work is continuing as he takes the necessary steps following his positive test.

Video: ReutersUS president Joe Biden meets virtually with Taoiseach Micheál Martin on St Patrick’s Day. The leaders met via video after Martin tested positive for Covid-19. Photograph: Nicholas KammAFP via Getty ImagesA major new initiative to try to secure thousands of visas for Irish people to live and work in the US has been launched by senior political figures in Washington. US Senate majority whip Dick Durbin, chair of Senate judiciary committee and Senator Pat Toomey, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation on Thursday to add Ireland to what is known technically as the E3 non-immigrant visa programme. The Bill would allow Irish nationals annual access to any unused E3 visas from the previous fiscal year. In exchange, Ireland intends to provide Americans expanded access to work visas in Ireland.The programme currently provides for about 10,000 visas to be allocated annually to Australia. Immigration reform advocates have maintained if the measure is passed by Congress it could see up to 5,000 people annually obtain US visas.  “The United States and Ireland have long championed the ideals of liberty and freedom, which has allowed our nations to form an unshakeable bond that nurtures these ideals,” Senator Durbin said in a statement. “I thank Senator Toomey for again partnering with me on this bipartisan Bill, which is a vital reiteration of not only our commitment to these principles, but also to our invaluable friendship with Ireland and its citizens. I remain committed to working to quickly pass this bipartisan legislation, as well as other critically-needed fixes to our broken immigration system.” Senator Toomey said the US has “long benefited from people coming here to work hard and contribute to our economy. “With this legislation, highly-skilled Irish workers can apply for the E3 non-immigrant visa programme to continue this tradition. I appreciate Senator Durbin working with me on this bipartisan immigration Bill, which will strengthen America’s relationship with Ireland.”The two Senators introduced a similar bipartisan Bill in the previous Congress. An identical companion Bill led by Congressman Richard Neal, chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means, passed the House of Representatives last Congress. However, the previous efforts to introduce the measure fell when it was opposed by one Republican senator. Congressman Neal said: “The relationship between the United States and Ireland has always been strong. “And this legislation for E3 non-immigrant visas will only make it stronger. As we celebrate St Patrick’s Day, let us recognise and honour the achievements and contributions that Irish-Americans have made to our country. With this legislation we will continue to be the land of opportunity and extend a hand to those who want to share in the American dream.”The E3 treaty professional visa is a temporary work visa currently limited to citizens of Australia. Up to 10,500 E3 visas may be granted each year and the visas are valid for up to two years on a renewable basis. Qualifying jobs in the US for which an E3 visa may be obtained require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in a speciality occupation.Former Fine Gael TD John Deasy who along with former Senator Billy Lawless has been lobbying in Washington to revise the E3 visas scheme, said on Thursday: “It’s important these senior senators are showing intent regarding the passage of the E3 Bill. We believe they’ll attempt to put together another immigration package this year, and they’re clearly indicating we’ll be included if that happens.”Meanwhile the US House of Representatives has passed unanimously a resolution criticising any move by the British government to block investigations into or prosecutions of crimes during the troubles in Northern Ireland.The resolution also urges that the urges that the Belfast Agreement be implemented in full to ensure peace and stability on the island of IrelandThe resolution calls on the European Union, including the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom to act in good faith with regard to negotiations around Brexit and implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.It also calls on the UK government “to charge iniduals who committed unjustifiable crimes on Bloody Sunday”.The resolution was proposed by Democratic congressman William Keating and had been backed by the Ancient Order of Hibernians.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics lionel barber on putin and how the west should deal with him","story":"As Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine enters its fourth week, with little sign of an outcome, the question of what an endgame of this war might look like is increasingly the subject of international debate.

Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsSarah Everard killer Wayne Couzens charged with four counts of indecent exposurePolitics latest news: Ben Wallace gives \u0026#39good bo---cking\u0026#39 to staff over impostor\u0026#39s call that could be \u0026#39easily intercepted\u0026#39Holi Festival 2022: How the thwarting of a Hindu demon king led to the colourful celebrationUS will impose \u0026#39costs\u0026#39 if China supports RussiaUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five developments as Moscow claims separatists \u0026#39tightening the noose\u0026#39 around MariupolMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"auditors damning verdict advice workers","story":"Auditors damning verdict on advice to workers on British Steel Pension SchemeThe National Audit Office publishes a report on its probe into how steelworkers lost out when they were given financial advice following an overhaul of Tata SteelSteelworkers lost tens of thousands of pounds Image: GettyByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Mar |commentsSteelworkers ripped off by pensions advisers lost an average of £, each - with at least one losing nearly half a million pounds, a report reveals today.

The damning judgement on the mis-selling scandal says: “Financial advice was unsuitable in % of British Steel Pension Scheme cases and unclear in a further % of transfers according to the Financial Conduct Authority. “This is much higher than for the defined benefit transfer market in general .” Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter About , steelworkers, many from South Wales, transferred a total of about £.billion from the firmaposs scheme when it was overhauled five years ago.  A Commons select committee previously said they were prey to vulture financial advisers. Today’s NAO report says some who transferred out of the scheme “suffered signicant financial losses because they were provided with unsuitable advice, the regulated financial advice market failed to protect them, and they have not been compensated fully”. The average loss in BSPS claims resolved by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme is £,, with inidual losses of up to £,, according to today’s report. Other workers whose cases have not been resolved or who did not seek redress may have lost dferent amounts. Explaining the background to the long-running scandal, the watchdog says: “During the BSPS restructure, members had to decide between two options for managing their pension benefits. “Some , members also had an alternative statutory option to transfer their pension fund out of the scheme altogether. “Members that wanted to transfer out of a DBpension scheme were required to take financial advice from a regulated advisorthe value of their pension is greater than £,.  “Almost , members chose to transfer their benefits out of the scheme to another pension arrangement. “Ninety-five percent of these decisions were informed by independent financial advisers. “BSPS members were particularly vulnerable to pension advice mis-selling. “Pensions are highly complex and most BSPS members had limited experience of making decisions about their pension or using a financial advisor.” Some victims are unable to seek compensation because firms which advised them have gone bust. The NAO says “ pension scheme members have lost £million of redress to date because financial advisers have gone into liquidation”.  NAO chief Gareth Davies said: Although measures have been put in place aimed at improving how the pensions advice market is regulated and to attempt to remedy the financial losses suffered by British Steel Pension Scheme members, it is clear that many people have not been compensated fully under current arrangements. “The BSPS case demonstrates the costs and dficulties of remedying failures in financial services and the importance of preventing problems from occurring in the first place. Labour MP Nick Smith, who has constituents in Blaenau Gwent hit by the affair, told the Mirror: “New ‘pension freedoms’ and trouble at Tata Steel facilitated a financial feeding frenzy. “Pension sharks swarmed on steelworkers, ripping them off through bad advice.  “The Government had introduced the requirement of receiving financial advice before transferring out of a scheme and yet most advisers would only get paida transfer took place - a financial incentive to recommend transferring out. “These steelworkers were badly let down, left at the mercy of rogue advisers, scammers and shameless introducers without any of the necessary support or advice they needed.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON National Audit OfficeBritish Steel PLCTata SteelNick SmithPensionsPoliticsSave Our Steel campaign\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The ring of steel around the Winter Gardens means the His Provision foodbank cannot pick up donated food from MS.The party wants its first conference in the North West resort for  years to be a metaphor – “illuminating” their ­Levelling Up agenda. But, sometimes, metaphors write themselves. “You only need to look three or four streets along from the conference to see the deprivation here,” says Mandy Hudson, , His Provision’s director. “The question is – will they see it ” It takes a certain kind of chutzpah for a ruling party to stage such an event in a town that has a staggering eight out of  of the most deprived wards in the country. But the Tories hope that, having spent millions of Whitehall money on the Winter Gardens, locals will grant them a free pass. When Chancellor Rishi Sunak addresses the conference tomorrow no doubt there will be yet more bucket-and-spade Levelling Up for Blackpool. Tomorrow, Boris Johnson will try his seaside postcard charms.But this is a town struggling with every index of social deprivation – child poverty, addiction, and a le expectancy for men of . Its inhabitants are afflicted by everything wrong and unfair about today’s economy and years of austerity – ­zero-hour jobs, short hours, poor wages, a punitive welfare system. “We need Government to look at the bigger picture,” Mandy says. “They say the right things, but we need action. “Nobody’s done anything yet – they’re all talk. Blackpool needs major investment in housing and jobs. But we are just the common people, I guess.” The town’s bid for £million from the government’s Levelling Up Fund for redeveloping the old post and sorting office was rejected last year.And while there has been cash for the Winter Gardens, the story begins in , when the council bought it along with the Tower and the Golden Mile Centre, in a £million deal partly funded by a Labour Government. Meanwhile, Mandy says need for her charity’s services has gone up % in the last  months. “Now it’s everybody who needs help,” she says. “Evenyou’re a regular family on the minimum wage there isn’t a lot left, everything is going up. “Work is hard, seasonal, and mostly zero hours or  hours a week.” Blackpool was once the Jewel of the North. In the s,  million visitors a year flocked to its Pleasure Beach, ft Tower, Big Dipper and other attractions. But painfully, for a town which bears the word Progress on its coat of arms, icy paddles in the Irish Sea were bypassed for sunny Spanish beaches as the era of the package holiday took hold. And factories across the north and Scotland, from which workers came for Wakes Week and Scots Week, steadily closed. Neglected Blackpool faces the cost of living crisis like the rest of the UK, but on sandy foundations. In a town that has long been a byword for leaving the lights blazing – “like Blackpool illuminations” – people can barely afford to turn their lights, or heating, or cookers, on. Disabled People Against Cuts will hold a protest outside the conference tomorrow, and a march on Saturday.  With the price rises and cost of living crisis, disabled people face the ­devastating impacts of poverty more fiercely than other demographics,” says Wendy Fell of Blackpool TUC. In today’s Blackpool, one of the top-­­­­rated restaurants on TripAdvisor, Pizza Grazie, is actually a clever way of subsidising a food service. During Covid, Amazing Grace delivered  meals a week. But the need hasn’t gone away. “Last week was the busiest we’ve ever had,” says volunteer Alfie Butcher, . “There were at least  people outside. There are families coming now, big families, it’s so sad. We’re turning the basement into a place where people can come and get their shopping.” He adds: “The Government has not helped us once in this place.” Chef Chris Rigby, , is stirring a giant pot of stock, ready to feed people tonight. “We see a lot of kids, whole families that have fallen on bad times,” he says. “People coming here to warm up because they can’t afford to put their heating on. Our own costs are going sky high. We need help.” Natalie Kheirkhah, , lives in ­Blackpool with her daughters, six and one, doing volunteer work and studying while she looks for paid work. She’s living frugally on Universal Credit, not using the gas, buying second-hand, showers not baths.“The Government doesn’t have the lived experience you need to understand what people’s lives are like – and how to help,” she says. “I worry all the time about food, everything is going up, it makes me anxious. “I do without but you can’t keep doing that all the time. My kids are clean, fed and happy but you can’t keep doing without yourself.” Michelle , , is an administrative officer who lives with her -year-old son. She is struggling to get by on her wages and being helped for the moment by her elderly mum. “It just feels like you’re constantly hitting brick walls when you’re trying to move yourself forward. You’re just pushed back all the time.” The TUC says Blackpool has been one of the worst hit areas in the UK from austerity and weak wage growth. A new study shows average pay in the town is £ a week lower than the North West average and £ a week lower than the national average. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says: “Everyone who works for a living deserves to earn a decent living.  “But pay packets in the North West are still worth less – in real terms – than in . Years of wage stagnation have left families badly exposed to Britain’s cost of living crisis. “Things can’t go on like this. Ministers must do far more to get pay rising across the region, and to protect workers from soaring bills and prices. “That means sitting down with unions and employers to develop industry-wide fair pay agreements. And it means imposing a windfall tax on energy profits and using the money raised to give hard-pressed households energy grants – not loans.” Blackpool has many things in its favour that could make it the Jewel of the North again – such as great beaches, historic architecture, the nation’s affection, and some brilliant people. Mandy Hudson says: “I’m not from here, but this is the most loving place I’ve ever lived.”  Tomorrow, the Tory faithful will pour in from trains and limousines. They won’t have come just for a stick of rock or a Kiss Me Quick hat – the Winter Gardens, not used for  years by any political party, has an uncanny knack of becoming part of British political history. Churchill addressed the party here in . Margaret Thatcher gave some of her most memorable speeches under its vaulted ceilings. In , a -year-old William Hague introduced himself. In , it was where Labour scrapped “common ownership” Clause IV. Perhaps the political plates will sht again. Whatever happens, this coastal town will be the canary in the mine for Tory economic policies. If Levelling Up is truly working, we will hear Blackpool sing.

But it acknowledged an error occurred in making a sale following an inquiry by a customer, with the store adding that it is adhering to sanctions outlined by the UK Government.Harrods responded after Labour MP Chris Bryant raised concerns that Russian vodka remains available in some major UK department stores as he accused firms of not really pulling their weight in imposing sanctions on Russia.The former minister told the House of Commons that bottles of Beluga vodka are available underneath the counter at Harrods while it is on the shelves at Selfridges. He also raised concerns over other companies still doing business in Russia. A Harrods spokeswoman said: Over a week ago, we removed products % sourced from Russia from the shelves of Harrods.  “This decision was taken alongside other steps such as changing the name of chicken kiev to chicken kyiv in our food hall, and halting deliveries to Russia. While Beluga vodka was removed from sale, remaining stock was held in storage ahead of being moved off site. After an inquiry by a customer, it was mistakenly brought out of stock and given to the customer. This was an error and should not have happened. All remaining stock has now been moved to an off-site location and is not available for sale. Exports of high-end luxury goods to Russia have been banned and import tarfs have been raised on hundreds of goods under UK economic sanctions on the country.The Government this week said Russian vodka would be among goods worth about £ million to be hit with an extra % tarf as it continued to inflict punitive measures in response to Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine.The export ban is expected to hit Russiaaposs access to luxury British vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art. Mr Bryant told the Commons: Can I ask for a debate on those who are not really pulling their weight in delivering sanctions on Russia over Ukraine  Because lots of shops in the UK have now withdrawn Russian products from their shelves, butyou still want to buy a £ bottle of Beluga vodka, for instance, you just go to Selfridges - itaposs on the shelvesyou go to Harrods, you actually have to ask for it and itaposs underneath the counter, literally underneath the counter. But also there are British companies who are still doing business in Russia, like Subway and Pirelli and Baker Tilly, who provide advice on how to hide your money. Isnapost it time that everybody pulled their weight because thataposs the only way we can make Putin fail  Commons Leader Mark Spencer said Mr Bryant was right to draw the Houseaposs attention to these matters. He added: Heaposs right that the only way in which we send the strongest message to that regime in Russia is to stick together and hold firm. I think heaposs right to ask for that debate and Iaposm sure thereaposll be methods - either through an adjournment debate or backbench business - for the House to continue to draw attention to those who are not condemning or issuing those sanctions as they should be. A spokesman for Subway said: Subway has no corporate operations in Russia. There are approximately  franchised restaurants in Russia which are all independently owned and operated by local franchisees and managed by an independent master franchisee. We donapost directly control these independent franchisees and their restaurants, and have limited insight into their day-to-day operations. While we do not control or manage the operations of independent franchisees in Russia, we will redirect any profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts supporting Ukrainians who have been affected by the war. We are also working with our franchisees across Europe to provide meals to refugees. Baker Tilly International said it will separate member firms in Russia and Belarus from our global network. In a statement, the company said: This decision is a direct consequence of the actions of these governments, and not the iniduals of these countries. Baker Tilly International firms will not serve government clients or state-owned enterprises of Russia or Belarus, or sanctioned entities and iniduals. It said this process will take some time and it remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our team members and their families in Ukraine. The statement added: We are mobilising financial and logistical support to ease their suffering, and we are continuing to raise critical funds for organisations providing direct humanitarian aid.

Morad Tahbaz, an American-Iranian national, who also holds British citizenship, remains in Iran but he has been released on furlough from prison.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: I can confirm Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and Anoosheh Ashoori willto the UK today, and Morad Tahbaz has been released from prison on furlough.They will be reunited with their families later today. We will continue to work to secure Moradaposs departure from Iran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on trumped up national security charges in  after a holiday to introduce her young daughter Gabriella to her parents. Her husband Richard, who lives with six-year-old Gabriella in Hampstead, London, has campaigned tirelessly for her release, including by going on hunger strike in October last year. Mr Ashouri, a retired engineer, was arrested in  on spying charges after travelling out to visit his mother. Conservationist Morad Tabaz was detained by the authorities in .The news comes after efforts by five British Foreign Secretaries tried to secure their release, including Boris Johnson who was widely criticised for telling a Commons committee in  that she was teaching journalism in the country. Her family have always denied the claim.Ms Truss and Foreign Office officials have been engaged in intensive behind-the-scenes talks to secure their release and officials finally found a way to settle a -year-debt.  Hereaposs how the deal was done. Negotiations have been underway for a long time over securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and other British nationals in Iran. Talks are understood to have intensied over the past six months, with help from the authorities in Oman. The pair are due to touch down in the Gulf state before ing to the UK later today. Alongside these talks, the UK has also settled a £ million debt to Iran which has proved a stumbling block to the release of British dual nationals. The -year row centres on Britainaposs sale of tanks to the Shah of Iran in the s. But the UK refused to send the tanks after the Iranian revolution, when the Shah was overthrown. Britain has today paid the debt, which appears to have been a signicant moment in the release of the detainees.  Officials have been working around the clock to find ways to pay the debt while complying the international sanctions imposed on Iran. The Foreign Office finally agreed that the funds can solely be used for humanitarian purposes. Ms Truss said it had been done in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations. The top Tory is said to have made securing their release and resolving the debt her top priorities when she took over as Foreign Secretary in September. After meeting all the families, she held talks with her Iranian counterpart in New York and tasked officials to hold talks in Tehran over October and November.  Omani ministers acted as mediators to help free the prisoners, with Ms Truss meeting the Omani Foreign Minister at Chevening in December. Negotiators travelled out to Omanaposs capital Muscat, last month to finalise the terms of their release. Ms Truss spoke twice to Iranian Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian in a final push to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion Talks have been ongoing for some time over the fate of the Brits in Iran but it is understood that the repayment of the debt got the deal over the line. However Mr Tabaz is still being kept in Iran on furlough from prison and there are other dual nationals who have not been freed.

Its treatment of staff is disgraceful but they operate this way because this Government has given the green light to the worst aspects of capitalism. Tory MPs who yesterday protested against the casual sacking of workers belong to a party that has spent years making it easier for firms to do so.The Government that yesterday complained about the use of fire and rehire is the same one that blocked legislation which would have prevented it.

People across the country are facing a real-terms cut to benefits next month, soaring inflation, and a hike in national insurance amid a looming cost of living crisis. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has already found around , people could be pulled into poverty because of benefit cuts in April. New analysis from the charity finds families on low incomes could face annual energy bills of around £, on average, an increase of around £ in comparison to last year. This means these families could be spending on average % of their incomes after housing costs on energy, or around £ in every £.  In February Rishi Sunak announced millions of people will get £ of help with rising energy bills. The Chancellor said people living in bands A to D would get a £ discount on their council tax in April as part of measures to help families facing a cost of living crisis. There will also be a £ rebate off energy bills in October - but this will need to be repaid over five years. Katie Schmuecker, Deputy Director of Policy  Partnerships at JRF said: “It defies logic to expect people to be able to cope with a steep increase in the cost of essentials when their incomes are not keeping up with inflation. We already hear countless examples of people across the country struggling to adequately heat their homes and feed and care for their families. Following a decade of cuts and freezes to the benefits system, this failure to keep pace with prices will cast more people into desperate situations. In a country as rich as ours in , this is just not right. “Our analysis shows that the Chancellor’s support to date is simply not going to protect households on the lowest incomes from the frightening increase in energy bills we are all going to face.“At a bare minimum, the Chancellor must increase benefits in line with inflation to prevent their value eroding further. It comes as unions have urged the government to reverse its decision to suspend the state pension triple lock, suggesting the move will cost pensioners almost £ a year. The TUC said April’s .% increase compared to the .% under the triple lock formula will cost someone on a full new state pension £ a year. Since the decision was taken, inflation has soared and is now expected to exceed % this year, which means pensioners are facing a “signicant real terms fall” in income this year, said the TUC. The TUC called on ministers to reinstate the pensions triple lock for   as well as taking measures to reduce household costs.

The occupation finally came to an end after Captain Favier went ashore and negotiated with the firmaposs bosses. The crew of the Pride of Hull are now leaving the ship after PO agreed to provide paperwork requested by their union.PO reportedly fired  workers over Zoom today after the company lost £million year on year. Do you work for PO or have you been affected by the cancelled ferries  Contact us on webnews@mirror  RMT organiser for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Gaz Jackson said the Pride of Hullaposs crew were “absolutely devastated” and described PO’s actions as “unacceptable” and “unforgivable”. He told reporters at King George Dock in Hull: “I got a phone call at am saying something was going to happen at PO, I got on boardand spoke to the captain and we said we’ve got to lt the gangway until we’ve got an agreement. “At am ratings and officers were informed there was going to be a pre-recorded Zoom meeting. After that two to three-minute call all the crew were made redundant.” Mr Jackson praised the captain for his “brave decision” to lt the gangway “for the safety of the crew”, saying security guards were “going to pull us offwe weren’t going to get off”.He said negotiations had come to an end when the company agreed to provide paperwork requested by the union.  Mr Jackson said: “The crew are absolutely devastated. I’ve seen grown men crying on there because they don’t know where they’re going to go from today.” He said it is “very likely” the new crew “won’t be British seafarers”. Mr Jackson said the union would hold demonstrations at PO ports and had a “legal injunction against the company”. Hullaposs Labour MP Karl Turner previously said Capt Favier was operating under maritime law to prevent anyone coming aboard his ship.  He added that those on the ship had enough food supplies to last as long as it takes to resolve the dispute. Earlier today he said: Iaposm told by Gaz Jackson, who is the RMT official who is sitting in on the ship, heaposs effectively locked in with the ship and the crew. Heaposs saying the captain is refusing to allow the police to enter the ship. Members have said to me that the vessel has got enough supplies to feed the crew for as long as it takes.

Prince Harry’s we Meghan was stripped of the prestigious role as part of the post-Megxit review when the couple quit their royal roles in favour of moving to the United States.The new duty for Camilla is another sign of the Queen’s faith in her daughter-in-law, who she endorsed as a future Queen Consort while marking her historic Platinum Jubilee last month.

Camilla is an avid theatre-goer, whose existing patronages include The Royal Academy of Dance, Royal Society of Literature, Friends of The Royal Academy, London Chamber Orchestra, National Youth Orchestra, Theatre Royal Bath, Unicorn Theatre for Children and Georgian Theatre Royal.

Furious passengers were initially told routes would be cancelled for a few days but then by up to  days as they locate new crews, it was reported. Were you caught up in the chaos  Email webnews@mirror  A van driver said the situation was an absolute nightmare with no information.Workers have told how they were given five minutes to get their stuff and get off the ship, reported The Sun, with security guards wearing balaclavas came on board to remove people.A dad said PO was “stabbing us in the back” and that he had to switch off the call where he was told he was being sacked. They claim the firm is running at a £ million loss but DP World who run it from Dubai is thriving, he said. “What they want is British seafarers gone as they see us as too expensive. The new foreign workers are already on board.And I’ve got nothing against them. But clearly the company has been planning this behind our backs for a long time. It’s not fair.  “We should have been given notice. Not half an hour.” Another -year-old engineer who has worked on ferries for over  years said: “This is no way to treat people. “I’ve seen coachloads of agency crews waiting in the car park at Hythe services in Kent, just waiting to come down.” Images from motorway cameras on the M and the M suggest the queues have cleared up this morning. Crew members of the Pride of Hull staged a protest after hearing news of their redundancies, refusing to get off the ship as instructed.RMT member and regional organiser for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Gaz Jackson, shared several video updates during the sit-in. At around am said of the stand-off: Weaposve got a real situation going on on the ground. Weaposve got a coachload of Filipino ratings waiting to take over from our British crew and also a coachload of heavy hands that are supposed to be handcuff-trained. So Iaposm expecting us to be lynched off this vessel, but me and other members are going to stay on here as long as it takes to get this situation resolved. The shipaposs Captain, Dutchman Eugene Favier, said he would refuse to let police on boardthey attempted.When he left the ship to talk to management, agency staff boarded and the sit in was brought to a close at around .pm.  Unions and politicians condemned the move, blamed by the company on losses of £ million following the slump in travel because of the pandemic. The Rail, Maritime and Transport unionis seeking legal advice to challenge the sackings. It said the UK has seen one of the most “vicious examples of despotic employer behaviour” and one of the most shameful episodes in its recent industrial history. Announcing the decision on Thursday, the ferry operator, bought by Dubai-based logistics giant DP World in , insisted the decision to cut jobs was “very dficult but necessary” as it was “not a viable business” in its current state. The union called for mass trade union and wider public support for demonstrations in Dover, Liverpool and Hull on Friday.  In a message to RMT members, general secretary Mick Lynch said: “It was with deep shock that I learned the news of the wholesale job cuts taking place at PO Ferries, but I am sure that my shock was nothing as compared to the devastation this news brought to you and your colleagues. “PO’s decision to lay off  workers is a kick in the teeth to the hard-working members of staff who have kept the business running through the global health crisis. “The RMT has received reports that security guards at Dover have boarded ships with handcuffs to remove crew so they can be replaced with cheaper labour. This union is horried that PO Ferries can treat their loyal workforce in such a despicable manner. “PO Ferries claimed almost £ million in Government grants in , which included furlough payments for its employees. PO is owned by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai. It paid a £ million idend to shareholders in . “This appalling situation has arisen as a result of DP World wishing to maximise their profits and the failure of the Government to intervene and protect the jobs of you and your colleagues. “Your union is seeking advice on what legal action can be taken.”  Mark Dickinson of Nautilus International said there are serious safety concerns around the decision to replace the seafarers with agency workers.He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: There are serious safety concerns, which is why the company cannot reintroduce services with the lower-paid agency crew that theyaposve recruited via this company called International Ferry Management of Malta.Mr Dickinson said the Maritime Coastguard Agency must be absolutely clear and confident that those new crew, unfamiliar with the vessels, unfamiliar with the routes, with the berths can operate ships safely.He added: This is an intensely worrying situation.Weaposve written to the Maritime Coastguard Agency and we hope and we pray that they will do their job.I know they will. They will do their job and make sure the ships are safe. He added: It is a dark day in the shipping industry. Iaposve been in this game for over  years and Iaposve seen some curveballs and some shocking developments over that time, but this is a new low for a shipping company.To treat the due legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me, taken my breath away. Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee, said PO had made “an appalling error”. “If they do not reverse immediately and reinstate the employees and follow proper process, it’s hard to see a way back for them commercially,” he said. “The parent DP World needs to understand that the British public will not do business with companies who treat their employees with such contempt.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said: “This is not a corporate restructure. It’s not the way we go about business in this country. “It is beneath contempt the action of thugs.” PO Ferries said in a statement: “We have made a £ million loss year-on-year, which has been covered by our parent, DP World. This is not sustainable. “Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RMT unionPO FerriesJob lossesRedundancy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tears of joy can be heard as the family were reunited and Nazanin could not stop hugging and showering her daughter with kisses. Her release came after the UK finally agreed to settle a £ million debt dating back to the s.Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said the Government was working to secure theof Mr Tahbaz, telling BBC Breakfast: He also has American nationality, which has in the eyes of the Iranians - not in ours - made his case more complicated.He added: We will continue to work to secure his release and, obviously, we work in close co-ordination with the US on these issues as well.

This is a long journey. I think when people think about normal le, they think about the le that they led before and, sadly, to some extent, that is not possible.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

But Mr Hebblethwaite stands by his decision to replace the fired staff with agency workers who will reduce the firmaposs crewing costs by %.Here is his letter in full:Dear Colleagues, By now I hope most of you had a chance to hear directly from your leaders and managers about the changes we’re making to our crewing model today to reduce our crewing costs by %, secure the future of our business and set it up for growth.  I’m getting in touch directly with all of you today because it’s important that that we all inidually understand the changes we’ve made to our business today and why we’ve made them. Before I get into the detail of the announcement I want to start by thanking you for all you’ve done so far today in handling disruption to our customers, and all I know you’ll continue to do in the coming days. I know it’ll be a challenging few days and your efforts are really appreciated by me and all the leadership team. Why we’re making changes to our crewing model As you know, here at PO Ferries, we play a critical role in keeping trade flowing, supply chains moving, and connecting families and friends across the North and Irish seas and the Channel. The Channel is a major supply route that delivers % of all UK trade with the European Union, with % of that trade passing through the port of Dover alone. Alongside these freight movements,  million tourists also cross the Channel every year.These supply routes require both the sea operations and the Channel Tunnel to balance competition, value and service for freight and tourism customers. We have been at the heart of this service for years and our shareholder and leadership team are committed to serving these routes. These changes that we’re talking about today are part of DP World’s wider plan to support PO Ferries to deliver the best for customers across freight and tourism industries. DP World is helping us invest in our future with new ships that will provide a better service for everyone, totalling £M.  However, in our current state, we are not a viable business. We have made a £M loss year on year, which has been covered by our parent DP World - this is not sustainable. Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now to protect the future of PO Ferries, and jobs across the whole business. These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary and pivotal decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options. Without the changes we’re making today to our crewing model there is no future for PO Ferries. What are the changes and the support available As of this morning, we are severing the contracts of all  Jersey-contracted seafaring colleagues with immediate effect and will be compensating them for lack of notice with enhanced severance packages.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter They are being offered support and being encouraged to access our employee assistance programmethey feel they need it, either now or in the coming days. As part of their package, they are also being offered careers advice and support. Today we have entered into a new partnership with International Ferry Managementwho are an international crewing company, and they will be responsible for providing new crews for all those ships affected by this change. Our new teams of seafaring colleagues have already joined our ships. Our new crew are now going through a process of intense familiarisation and training programme on our ships, run by IFM. Only when that process has happened, will we graduallyto a normal service safely and securely - upholding our PO standards and brand. This new crew model will reduce our crewing costs by % and enable us to better compete and be more responsive to our customers’ needs. It is a model that is proven to work across the industry, while still allowing us to retain service and safety levels which are central to our operations.As well as protecting our future, and jobs across the business we are also guaranteeing our customers a resilient, sustainable and competitive business and securing a quality service to the major trade routes of the UK. We already have the strong fundamentals in place - the best ships, on the best routes, under the best brand. Several weeks ago we took the first step in transforming ourselves by restructuring our business so we’re set up for growth. The second, and most dficult, step is the one we’re making today – which will make us the most competitive business operator in the industry. By taking these steps we’re bringing together our years of heritage with the forward thinking of our partner DP World, so that we can unlock the potential of our business for now and the long term.What’s next  I appreciate there is a lot to take in, and you may understandably feel surprised by the suddenness of this news. These changes are so signicant we were conscious of the inevitable disruption and uncertainty during any consultation period. Against that background we determined that it was better to take immediate action. We are currently briefing all the colleagues directly affected whether they are on ships or on leave.

Some PO staff occupied one of the ferries in protest - and are now being hauled off by security staff wearing balaclavas. Customers critical of PO’s “disgusting” actions are now piling onto the company on Facebook, under a recent post explaining what the “changes” would mean in the short term for customers.“Today weaposve announced changes to provide a better service to our customers. While we make these changes, many of our services will not be running over the next few days,” the post read. “We apologise for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience during this time. We look forward to welcoming you back to PO Ferries shortly.”  ”If you are due to travel with us over the next few days we will be making contact with you and you can find the latest travel information on our website.” The post has attracted hundreds of comments, largely from customers both bewildered and angry at PO’s actions and subsequent messaging. “Is this for real  ” one person asked. “Bad taste here p+o, absolutely bad taste in even suggesting todayaposs news is to provide a better service. How about staying off social media whilst these + staff members youaposve just made redundant take in the news that youaposre replacing them with cheaper agency staff on zero hour contracts.......” Another said they would be taking their money where when their next trip rolled around. “I have a Motorhome and take it to Europe but it will never now be with you lot,” they commented. “If this is how you treat loyal staff and customers you deserve to go bust.”One commentator had posted a link to PO Ferries’ Trustpilot page, where its rating had sunk to . stars - likely pushed down by a recent swathe of  star reviews.“Iaposd write how I really feel about P  O here, but guideline standards prevent me,” one person had posted today alongside their rating.  In a pre-recorded video announcing mass redundancies today, staff were told: The company has made the decision that its vessels going forward will be primarily crewed by a third party crew provider. Therefore I am sorry to inform you that this means your employment is terminated with immediate effect on the grounds of redundancy.”Earlier today the ferry firm suspended its services, with customers told to use rivals instead. The company employs , workers and has  ships.The spokesperson said PO is not a viable business as it is, adding that its survival was dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries it said.  These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options. As part of the process we are starting today, we are providing  seafarers with immediate severance notices and will be compensating them for this lack of advance notice with enhanced compensation packages.PO runs , voyages a year across the English Channel, North Sea and Irish Sea. The firm has suspended sailings for the next few days. Earlier today Labour MP Diana Johnson told the Commons the mass lay-offs were reminiscent of the worst Thatcherite policies. She told MPs: I understand from the RMT union that these agency staff, mainly from overseas, are in buses on the quayside with a security firm... wearing balaclavas and taking British crew off these ships. The general secretary of the RMT, Mick Lynch, said: We have instructed our members to remain onboard and are demanding our members across POaposs UK operations are protected, and that the Secretary of State intervenes to save UK seafarers from the dole queue. The Department for Transportis having urgent discussions with PO, according to the official spokesperson for the prime minister. The spokesperson added: It does obviously cause concern for PO workers, the company is not ceasing to operate and DfT is speaking with them to understand what the potential impact is so there will be further updates later on.”PO staff on one ferry are reportedly staging a sit-in protest on the firmaposs Pride of Rotterdam ship, in Hull.The mother of a PO worker told a Mirror sister title that PO staff were told they had five minutes to get their stuff and get off the ships. Earlier today the company told its staff by email to expect a major announcement. The email said: We will be making a major company announcement today which, with the support of our shareholder DP World, will secure the long-term viability of PO Ferries. To facilitate this announcement all our vessels have been asked to discharge their passengers and cargo and standby for further instructions. This means weaposre expecting all our ports to experience serious disruption today so please bear with us and we will give further information in an all-colleague announcement later today. If youaposre in a customer facing role further information will follow separately on how we would like you to work with our customers. Thank you for your patience and support. This morning a PO spokesperson denied claims the firm was going bust. The PO spokesperson added: We have asked all ships to come alongside, in preparation for a company announcement. Until then, services from PO will not be running and we are advising travellers of alternative arrangements.In January The Mirror reported that the billionaire owners of PO Ferrie s stood accused of splashing out millions sponsoring a golf contest while ignoring calls to fund the firmaposs pension pot.PO Ferries, which is is owned by logistics firm DP World, cut around , staff during the pandemic, while seeking Covid bailouts.

The couple have done many overseas tours and in  even took a three-year-old Prince George and a baby Princess Charlotte on an official trip to Canada. When the then-family-of-four arrived in British Columbia, on hand to greet them was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But there was an awkward moment when George left Mr Trudeau hanging after going in for a high-five. During the meeting, Mr Trudeau bent down to Georgeaposs level and held out his hand for a high-five.  But the young royal looked unimpressed and shakes his head. The Canadian PM tried again offering a low-five, which George also refused before going in for a more formal handshake. But once again the young prince did not appear to want to indulge the Canadian leader. The snub was far from causing an international incident, however. Mr Trudeau later tweeted that he and his we Sophie were honoured to receive the royals.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Forecasters say temperatures will rise to a balmy C in the south east. It is also predicted to be warmer than Istanbul where temperatures of only C are forecast.The warm weather is expected to last until March  and the UK officially enters spring on Sunday with higher than usual temperatures.BBC weather says it expects London and the South East of the country to remain around C or C as the dry sunny weather continues. It means parts of the country are warmer than Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia in Spain. They also match thermometers in Ibiza where C is expected tomorrow.The Met Office reports it will be chilly tonight and on Friday morning.A largely dry evening, with patchy cloud and some sunny intervals before dusk. Skies becoming clear overnight with potentially extensive mist or fog patches developing toward dawn, mainly further west. Rather cold with light winds. Minimum temperature  °C. The temperatures will start to rise throughout the day and a high of C is scheduled for parts of the UK tomorrow. The Met Office forecast there would be a fair amount of sunshine around for many parts of the country.  Initially fog is forecast for tomorrow morning before giving way to clearer and warmer conditions coupled with warm sunshine Charts state Fog and low cloud steadily clearing to allowing plenty of sunshine in many areas, and feeling quite warm.

Under clear skies it will be frosty for much of the country and could dip to -C in Scotland.Fog patches may cause some disruption to travel during the morning rush hour, said theMet Officewith a yellow warning running until .am through western England and Wales.A widespread frost with temperatures dipping down close to freezingnot below, certainly for the glens of Scotland we could see a value of - or -C to start the day, said Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir. We run into this dense fog anywhere from the Midlands, mid-Wales down towards the West Country, central and southern England.  But the temperature will soon rise with warmest temperatures in central and southern England and Wales. Ms Nasir continued: Through the day on Friday plenty of blue sky and plenty of sunshine. The sunshine could turn hazy in the west of Scotland as we see more high cloud there and certainly quite a breeze across the Western Isles. Even so everywhere remains dry through the afternoon and that will really help temperatures up very nicely as we head through the middle part of the day. So temperatures coming in around C or C in Scotland or Northern Ireland. However we could see values peaking around C or C across mid-Wales, down towards the south east of England. That’s the picture on Friday, a bright end to the working week.”  Then on Saturday the warmest temperatures are expected to be in Scotland. Winds coming in from the east or the South East means that the highest temperatures are always going to be across more sheltered western areas,” said Mr Bett, of BBC weather. “It could make C along the coast of north west England but it is up towards the north west Highlands and perhaps in the Moray Firth that temperatures could reach C or C, it could be the warmest day of the year so far.” UK forecast for the next  days Plenty of fine weather today once early fog clears. Today: Early fog patches over parts of Wales, the Midlands and southern England soon lting and clearing. Otherwise, conditions fine and dry with plenty of pleasantly warm sunshine. Breezy in the north and across English Channel coastal areas. Tonight: Quickly turning chilly this evening and then a dry night with mostly clear skies. Breezy as well, especially in the south and west. Saturday: Fine, dry and bright with plenty of sunshine, but also windy, especially in the south and west. Feeling pleasantly warm in the sunshine out of the wind. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Mostly fine and dry with some sunshine. Cloudier in the east with rain and showers moving north, becoming dry on Tuesday. Cooler than recently, but turning warmer again by Tuesday.

Ricky Siemens was driving illegally in a truck that was on a spare tyre when the wheel burst. His truck had a head on smash into a van carrying young golfers from a Texas university, on Tuesday night. The National Transportation Safety Board vice-chair Bruce Landsberg confirmed the horric incident which led to a number of deaths, over half of whom were teenagers. They smashed into a van carrying eight University of the Southwest golf students, six of whom and their coach died.The fiery smash happened west of Dallas, Texas, just north of the towns of Midland and Odessa. Ricky had been driving with his -year-old dad Henrich Siemens, a dad-of-five, with the pair were on their way to pick up a new car at the time.  Agatha ‘Aggie’ Siemens, the widowed mum who lost her husband and son in the crash said: “They were going to pick up a car that [Siemens] bought. “I was supposed to see him about two hours later,” The New York Post reported. The crash killed college golfers Mauricio Sanchez, , Travis Garcia, , Jackson Zinn, , Karisa Raines, , Laci Stone, , and Tiago Sousa, . Two students, Hayden Underhill and Dayton Price, survived the horric smash. They were pulled from the wreckage and airlted to a nearby hospital where as of yesterday they remained in critical condition. Mr Price suffered third-degree burns to nearly half his body according to the description of a GoFundMe campaign that has since raised £,. Their coach Tyler James, , who was driving the young athletes was also tragically killed in the accident.After their tyre burst, the van swerved across the central reservation and slammed into the oncoming van head on. “This was clearly a high-speed collision,” Landsberg said, but he added it was unclear how fast the vehicles were travelling. Sergeant Steven Blanco of Texas DPS told the New York Post that the cause of the crash had not yet been determined and cops ordered toxicology and other forensic reports. According to state law in the area, motorists must be at least  years old to get their provisional licence, and at least  before they can begin to get classes to get their learner’s licence.  The college’s Ford Transit van was carrying nine people and towing a box trailer while heading back from a recent golf tournament, where both the women’s and men’s teams had competed.The accident remains under investigation and grieving relatives mourned their losses on Facebook.Ms Siemens posted a collage tribute to her two boys which read: “in loving memory” surrounded by pictures of the family. Ms Siemens posted another tribute to the boy on Facebook with a photo of her son in his NASA T-shirt and tracksuit pants, smiling at the camera. The NTSB revealed the age of the driver on Thursday but didn’t identy him.  Tributes have been pouring in for the six college golfers and coach who were killed in the crash. Gary Raines, father of Karisa, , who died in the accident, speaking on the Today show, said: “We are praying so much for the families of all those other kids. “Right now we just keep thinking we’re gonna wake up from this terrible nightmare. But itaposs not happening.” Karisa’s mum, Sandy, said: “I donapost know what Iaposm going to do without her.” A fundraiser for funeral expenses for Karisa has raised £, so far.  A memorial has been set up at the golf course where the team practiced, with flowers, gold balls and handmade signs left for the youngsters. Rockwind Community Links manager, Ben Kirkes saw the golfers almost everyday. He said: “aposWe have a memorial. Itaposs the very least we could do for the players and of course coach James. Itaposs a tough time. “These kids were great kids and they were great, great community members. They were polite and they were just a pleasure to be around.” Ryan Erwin, vice president for student engagement and athletics at East Texas Baptist University in Marshall, said that Coach James had been “living out his dream”.

The practice, which has been going on for more than  years, was started completely by accident. A former Chicago Mayor wanted to clean up the cityaposs riverfront area, to do this he got plumbers to use an orange dye into peopleaposs water systems. When the solution came into contact with sewage, it turned a bright green. The bright green wash gave one member of the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local union an idea. Today, the descendants of just two families from that plumbers union are still the ones responsible for dyeing the river each year.Typically the river is dyed every Saturday before St Patrickaposs Day, with this year thousands of braving the cold last weekend to celebrate and the green river, NPR reports.The families say they now use a more environmentally-friendly solution made from vegetables . However the actual recipe for the dye is a closely guarded secret. The dye is known by the two families as aposLeprechaun Dustapos and is orange before coming into contact with water.Margaret Frisbie, executive director of Friends of the Chicago River, has long campaigned to end the practice of dyeing the river. She argues that it perpetuates the idea that humans can do whatever they like to the environment. Frisbee told Euronews: Illinois EPA has never required a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systempermit so there is no way to know what the dye is or whether it is harmless. Imagine fish, beavers or otters swimming through that dyed-green water and you might think a new celebration is the right idea. While we donapost know the full impact of the dye on the ecosystems of the Chicago river, we do know that dyeing the river has encouraged copycats and not just in other cities.  Only a certain section of the Chicago river is allowed to be dyed each year.However illegal dyeing occurred in both  and , during the Covid- pandemic.The Chicago TV news station WTTW reports that police officers will be on the lookout for any illegal dyeing taking place this year.

The two get on well and bond together before Morosini’s character starts striking up a more romantic approach which escalates into sexting. In real le, Morosini discovered that “Becca” was in fact his dad when he saw that their email addresses were the same. And rather than the two falling out again, they were able to build on the strange way that they had reunited and now have a strong relationship. “It was us hitting that rock bottom in our relationship, but it forced us to confront some of the foundational problems of our relationship and actually caused things between him and I to get a lot better over time, because we had to talk about it,” Morosini said.

We all know the story. Cinderella is treated horribly by her Wicked Stepmother, who favours her ugly stepsisters, and is forced to be their maid. One night, they all get invited to the ball, and of course, Cinderella is forbidden from going. The Fairy Godmother, however, has other ideas and decides she WILL go to the ball, before transforming her scruffy rags into a beautul gown. However, when the clock strikes midnight and Cinderella attempts to make a quick escape, she loses a glass slipper - which fans point out is a major plot hole. The discovery came after a film fan asked Reddit users: What’s the worst plot hole you’ve seen in a well-regarded movie  - and one person was quick to bring up one in Cinderella thataposs bugging them.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Cinderella, she is told by the fairy godmother that everything will turn back to what it originally was at midnight, they wrote. Her dress, carriage, and horses do so why don’t her glass slippers  But apparently, thereaposs a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, as someone replied explaining that Cinderella’s dress and her horse and carriage were transformed from items she already had. Whereas the slippers were made from magic itself and hadnapost been transformed, so couldnapost disappear. I believe the slipper was a surprise gt from the Fairy Godmother, explained a Reddit user. Cinderella realises it’s not gone in the morning as it should have been and gives an aposoh, thank youapos out to the universe for it, showing that she recognises that while the original deal was for midnight, the Fairy Godmother did something special allowing the shoe to be kept as a memento. Another plot hole that other Cinderella fans have pointed out are also glass slipper related. If you’re going to rip on Cinderella, you could at least bring up her slippers that fit like a dream and then suddenly fall off, one person wrote, which now come to think of makes a good point. But, thereaposs an answer for this too. Sheaposd been dancing all night. Glass slippers donapost ‘breathe’ so Iaposm pretty sure sweat had begun to pool in them and her feet were slick, one person theorised.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Luckily, Taryn Ross, talent acquisition manager at the recruiting firm Pivot + Edge, has some advice that will put you at the top of the candidate list.On the companyaposs TikTok account @pivotandedge , Taryn revealed the biggest mistake you could be making that could be unknowingly stopping you from landing your dream job.She says it all comes down to how you answer the age-old question - Whataposs your greatest weakness  First off she explains exactly how you should not respond. Taryn said that when youaposre asked what your greatest weakness is, you shouldnapost say you canapost think of anything or that you donapost have any weaknesses as this will have the interviewer immediately crossing your name off their list of prospective hires.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. She also said that although itaposs good to be honest, itaposs probably best not to say anything that would obviously jeopardise your chances of getting the job, like saying youaposre never on time . Taryn also said that you donapost want to say your biggest weakness is something completely unrelated to the job, like for example, revealing your love for fast food. Instead, you want to pick something that still paints you in a flattering light. Taryn gave these good examples: I sometimes have dficulty asking for help when needed.I like to get my work done quickly and efficiently but it is something I am actively working on. Another acceptable answer Taryn provided was: I often have a hard time saying no. Iaposm a team player and want to help out my colleagues to the best of my ability, but I need to stop overfilling my own plate. In the comment section, Taryn gave additional answers when asked about your weaknesses. If your weakness is confrontation, Taryn suggested saying: In the past I found myself compromising too much to avoid upsetting others, but I learned that it was more beneficial to everyone to offer constructive criticism when needed. Now, I practice being assertive and listening to all points of view so I can offer genuine solutions vs. temporary fixes. And for those who struggle with overthinking, she said: I tend to consider all perspectives and outcomes before making a decision, which can cause delays. I’ve learned to find a balance between positive results and efficiency because perfection isn’t always attainable. Now, I set limits and stay accountable to them so I don’t overthink.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Thataposs dearer - the XL one.If Leoni had ordered a regular UberX taxi, it would have cost her between £, and £,, butshe had splurged out on an UberXL, it would have cost between £, and £,. Leoni explained: Iaposd gone out with one of my friends in Swinton. We came up with the conversation about the war in Ukraine. One too many drinks later, we were trying to get a taxi home. We said aposshall we get a taxi and go help themapos. Weaposd been out for about four hours so Iaposd had a few double pink gins and quite a lot of shots of Sambuca and a bottle of prosecco. I think that might have tipped me over the edge. I donapost know what Iaposd doUber had let me order it. I donapost think Iaposd have got in but you donapost know after a drink. I might have piled into the taxi and realised when we got further out. It would have been coming out of my account and I donapost know where Iaposd have woken up. After weaposd done that, I couldnapost get a taxi for about an hour and a half. They were allowing me to go to Ukraine but not  minutes up the road back home. It was only about . and I had to ring a few dferent taxi companies then to get a taxi. I got in at about .

And even host Ben Shephard was left in stitches when he was shown the clip on Good Morning Britain, adding I think we need to go there for a pint!  What do you think about the celebration  Let us know in the comments...In the clip, punters in the pub in Belfast, Ireland, are clearly feeling the tension as contestant John answers questions to earn counters, which are then placed into a giant coin pusher. People begin shouting “go on” at the pub’s TV, and a small cheer can be heard as a few coins fall over the sides - but thataposs nothing compared to whataposs to come.  Johnaposs luck continues as the jackpot counter - a gold coin with a red star- then falls over the side, and the whole pub erupts. In scenes resembling the Hyde Park celebration when England scored a goal in the World Cup, people can be seen jumping in the air, cheering, as drinks struggle to stay in their glasses. Dannyaposs video has been viewed over , times and had over a thousand comments, mostly from people blown away by the footage.

British military intelligence and the Ukraine army have said that the Russians have suffered heavy losses, estimated at being around ,, according to the US, with Vladimir Putin ’s army having come up against stf resistance. The Ministry of Defence tweeted: “Logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine.“Reluctance to manoeuvre cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel. “Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to ert large numbers of troops to defend their own supply lines. This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential.”  The momentum of the invasion that was projected by Putin as a special military operation to “de-nazy” Ukraine has slowed right down with the Russians unable to capture key cities. They are slowly encircling the capital Kyiv but they are having to fight for every inch of ground and the Ukrainians have managed to heavily forty the city. Instead now it appears as though the Russians are trying to shell Ukrainians into submission. But at the same time Ukraine is now making counter-attacks and Moscow is having to bring in other troops to take up the fight while Putin has also reportedly resorted to trying to bring in paid foreign fighters.  Online monitor, Oryx Blog, using only open-source material to work out losses, said that  Russian tanks have been confirmed destroyed, abandoned, captured or otherwise lost. This is likely to be an underestimate with Ukraine authorities claiming it to be  tanks that they have destroyed.“It clearly is not going the way that Russia planned,” one western official said, reported The Times.“Not only is it not going the way that it was planned, but even as they have adjusted to a rather more grinding form of warfare, that is stalling as well. That is very encouraging resistance from the Ukrainians. We don’t know how long they can hold out.  We hope it will be as long as possible. We know that Russia is trying to generate more forces to sustain the campaign and we see signs out of some quite peripheral places around Russia and its borders, which clearly was not part of the original plan.” Despite battleground setbacks and punitive sanctions by the West, Putin has shown little sign of relenting.  His government says it is counting on China to help Russia withstand blows to its economy. The United States, which this week announced  million in new military aid to Kyiv, is concerned Beijing is considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.President Joe Biden, who described Putin as a murderous dictator, will make clear to Chinaaposs President Xi Jinping in a call Friday that Beijing will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russiaaposs aggression, Blinken told reporters.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Ministry of DefenceVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, a new iant has emerged and cases are up by %British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Image: REUTERSopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments For weeks, the politicians were very quiet about Covid, pretending it’s gone away.Then ministers suddenly got busy, lting all travel restrictions from today. We’re now in a free-for-all. Fingers crossed, because it’s a gamble with the nation’s health and the lives of the vulnerable. No mandatory masks on planes, trains and buses, or in schools or shops. That sounds correct, but the abolition of official rules brings confusion and uncertainty. In this do-it-yourself pandemic policy, who knows how to behave Boris Johnson, who uses the Ukraine war as a covering for his face , wants us to believe it’s all over. It isn’t. Driven by the super-infectious Omicron BA iant, new cases are up by %. There are , in hospital, with  on ventilators. Deaths on Wednesday numbered , bringing the seven-day total to . Protection gained by booster jabs is fast disappearing, and we’re still waiting for the vital fourth dose. It may come soon for the over s and vulnerable, but not until later in the year for the general population. With a hundred deaths being recorded every day, this feels like Covid complacency.And the Government is dragging its feet over the independent pandemic inquiry. It’s unlikely to take evidence before the winter – and not report until at least two years.This deliberate delay takes the verdict on the Great Tory Pandemic Bungle until well after the general election, thereby letting Boris Johnson off the hook. I don’t know about Covid being endemic, but we are being asked to live with endemic political corruption. *********** In , King James I described smoking tobacco as loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs.

Melinda Jansen van Vuuren first noticed her fingertips turning purple, becoming tender and temperature sensitive in October . The -year-old said: “Very quickly – within a matter of two and a half weeks – my fingertips had turned gangrenous. Doctors have now diagnosed her with Buergeraposs disease, an extremely rare condition that causes small and medium blood vessels to clot and become inflamed. It’s closely associated with smoking and Melinda has since kicked the habit, having used tobacco since she was , smoking  cigarettes a day.But quitting came too late and today she faces losing three fingertips on her dominant right hand, plus another on her left. Melinda, from Alberton, South Africa, said: It’s very severe. “Iaposm unable to use my hands basically at all. I canapost cook, clean, wash or brush my hair, I canapost bathe. The pain is excruciating and constant.” She added: “Iaposm a personal assistant and a qualied nail technician, so I always work with my hands but I canapost anymore.“I havenapost been able to write since last October.”Doctors told her there is nothing they can do to help and she faces the torture of waiting for her fingertips to simply fall off. She added: “As far as I know thereaposs no treatment.  “They opted for auto amputation instead of surgical amputation, and basically to treat and prevent this happening again all tobacco products had to be stopped immediately.” Photos taken by Melinda of her right hand chart the progress of the disease. The discolouration is hard to see in an initial picture, but soon it looks like an ink smudge on one finger, before a darker colour engulfs several fingers. In newer images, the affected fingertips have taken on a black-green hue. And to make matters worse, the loss of these fingertips may not be the end.  “The gangrene may flare up again and progress,” said Miss Van Vuuren. “It has caused even more depression, anxiety and a lack of self worth. “Itaposs been one of the most challenging stages of my le. It has taken perseverance, tears and strength to get this far.” Melinda is now warning others to avoid tobacco, in a bid to save others from her fate. She said: “It’s been a huge struggle to quit smoking as it always helps with anxiety and also eases pain. “My advice is to never start – it’s not healthy and looks unattractive.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Smoking\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition. Half are missing school. Millions are displaced. And none of them have ever known anything but war.One of my colleagues there, a -year-old man, tells me he has never seen peace in his letime.

His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We welcome this decision, though it should have come much sooner.“Tackling state disinformation is vital to protect our security and democracy, yet inexplicably the Online Safety Bill published yesterday by Government fails to mention this.“Ministers must strengthen the Bill and ensure that state actors trying to undermine our country are thwarted.”The RT news website is currently still up and running but its YouTube channel has been taken down."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-security-not-compromised-hoax-calls-says-minister   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values. They are that memorable phrase we hear our elders say once they have explained its meaning to us, we are unlikely to forget it.Theyto us often and roll off the tongue.One of the most important collections of Gaelic proverbs was published in  by Alexander Nicolson .However, Nicolson was merely re-printing a collection made by Donald Macintosh, a Perthshire-born clergyman, first printed in Edinburgh in . Nicolson called the collection “a genuine product of the past” with Macintosh merely acting as collator and translator. of Islay, perhaps coined in the times when the MacLeans, MacDonalds, and later Campbells feuded over the island the second one is a rhyme about the MacAlpines, their former seat in Dunstaffnage, and their ancient claim to the throne of Scotland:When the natives forsake Islay, farewell the peace of Scotland!Children of the native kings, Who reigned down at Dunstaffnage, Who first the crown of Alba owned, And still have native claim to it..It also tells us that there are always grave, far-reaching political consequences whenever an indigenous population is forced to abandon its home.as a hereditary right can last for centuries. The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good. Psychologically and spiritually, we inherit their trauma physically, as the proverb reminds us, we may inherit their medical conditions.By accepting the full extent of our inheritance – strength and weakness, the beautul and the ugly – we grow closer to our ancestors and empower ourselves to heal from what they could not.has always been characterised by plurality and complexity, reflecting the complex Gàidhealtachd to which it belonged.For centuries, fostering children has been an important feature of Gaelic society, and for all the influence that DNA can have on us, the nurture we receive during our formative years has just as much –not more – influence on who we become within our community.In a changing world, it is inspiring to see people across the Gàidhealtachd connecting with the cultural ‘mycelium’ of their place and rooting themselves in it, whether it is their ancestral homeland or adoptive home.can be a wellspring of transformative energy for place-based revitalisation.Sometimes it seems to burst like lightning, explosively cleaving through adversity. But it is also the stream – the carrying stream – slowly weathering stone, flowing ever on from generation to generation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4520229.jpg--.jpg?1647517027000\n","title":"researcher seeks memories of gallaher girls","story":"THEY were made famous by bawdy comic James Young with a lyrical line in his epic tribute to the Seven Towers - The Ballymena Cowboy.His refrain about the Gallaher Girls once attracted roars of laughter amongst audiences far and wide.But now a social history researcher is keen to find out more about the women who found employment at Gallahers Lisnafillan plant on the outskirts of Ballymena and hes asked the we can help him make contact with some ladies who worked there.Pete Hodson told us: I’m a postdoc researcher based at Trinity College Dublin. I’m wonderingyou could help drum-up some interest in my oral history project ‘Manufacturing Memory’. It uses Gallaher’s Lisnafillan factory to explore the working lives of female industrial workersand the wider impact of redundancies and closure on the Ballymena economy. My background is in industrial and working-class history. I used Harland  Wolff and the British coal industry as case studies for my PhD at Queen’s . There’s quite a bias towards male-employing heavy industries in academic studies, so I’m focusing instead on a ‘light’ industry that employed women in large numbers. Gallaher’s was the obvious choice – the Ballymena plant in particular. “It’s important to get these perspectives on the record as the working lives of women in industry still remains, to a large extent, ‘hidden history’. Pete explained that interviews would only last a short time.I’m looking to interviewwomen who worked at Lisnafillan any time since . THOUGHTS“I’d like to understand why they chose Gallaher’s, the nature of their job, shopfloor culture, balancing motherhood family le with employment – before moving on to their thoughts on why the factory closed, how they navigated redundancy, and the impact on Ballymena’s economy. Interviews will last around  hour, and interviewees will be sent a full transcript for review. Anonymity can be granteddesired. One of the planned outputs is a temporary exhibition in The Braid using extracts from these interviews, supplemented by archival documents and photographs unearthed at PRONI and National Museums Northern Ireland.

That’s according to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, who was speaking after the ferry operator sacked  staff yesterday. It could be another week before the firm’s ships will be able to operate again and Mr Poots has warned that goods normally coming here wont be able to get in. There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which wont get out. About % of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us, he told BBC NIs The View. Meanwhile the Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon MLA, has expressed her concern at the actions by PO Ferries and the impact locally. The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London. With the Economy Minister I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes."},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs emma vardy is on the crest of a wave and set to tie the knot at co antrim fairytale castle","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”. It was reported that members of staff at the River Shannon facility had expressed concerns to management about accepting Russian coal in the current circumstances.On Monday, Andrei Melnichenko, owner of Russia’s biggest coal producer, said publicly that the war in Ukraine was a tragedy that must be stopped.Most ReadPO Ferries confirm  staff have been made redundant after firm made £m lossHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleSchools’ Cup Final: Ben McFarlane the Methody hero as superb second-half comeback earns them record th title with victory over CampbellSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin parade in picturesTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandSafety fears raised as PO Ferries replaces seafarers with agency workersProtest at Larne Harbour on Friday afternoon over sacking of  PO Ferries staffLarne boss Tiernan Lynch urges his side to rediscover killer touch as race for Europe gathers paceDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan to run in Lagan Valley constituency in upcoming Assembly electionUlster’s Grand Slam chasing Ben Carson admits he feared he would never play rugby again after punctured spleenLatestChannel  to air documentary about campaign to free Nazanin Zaghari-RatclfeSix Nations silverware at stake in Dublin – Ireland v Scotland talking pointsUK security was not compromised by hoax calls, says ministerRussian strikes hit Lviv as Vladimir Putin makes only ‘minimal progress’US firm Sycamore Partners mulls takeover deal for Ted Baker,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It takes me three hours at work to pay for my travel with my shts on average being between seven and eight hours.”With the cost-of-living crisis, she said young workers feel they should receive a pay rise and get the top minimum wage hourly rate of £., as they work as hard as someone aged .Unison’s Saoirse Fanning said the survey findings around Covid were particularly concerning.Twenty-five per cent could not self-isolate, % couldn’t afford to, and % said their employer wouldn’t allow it.She added: “We have been fighting for our members to get paid in full while off sick with Covid- or having to isolate.“Some employers were only paying statutory sick pay, even though money was available from the Department for Communities to pay staff in full.” She said the privatisation of services meant front line staff were on “poverty pay and poor terms and conditions”.She called for a social clause to be included in all contracts outsourced to the community sector.Independent councillor Gary Donnelly said what he was hearing was “shocking”, and asked what council could do to assist.Ms Ward said workers doing the same job should receive the same pay rate regardless of age.Mr McCarroll said Derry suffered from deprivation and neglect from ious governments and it can’t be the case that the city progresses on the back of local workers getting paid just over £ an hour without sick pay.He suggested the council look at wage inequalities and exploitation, and that hospitality businesses should make their pay rates known on menus.People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin branded wages for teenagers “a disgrace” and said every worker should receive at least the minimum wage.He proposed initiating research to get an accurate assessment of pay scales across the council area. He was told a motion could be brought before the full council.Councillor Derek Hussey, who has been in the hospitality business since , said he was “really shocked” by Grace and Cliona’s revelations.“The figures you’re quoting, I wouldn’t have got away with back when I first started in the business,” he added.“At the weekend I had an event and had to bring in part-time workers. I can assure you that I had to pay well — well over the minimum wage in order to actually get folk to work.”The DUP’s Hilary McClintock said for someone to have to work for three hours to pay travel and to not have guaranteed hours was “exploitation”.Related topicsDerry City and Strabane District CouncilCost of LivingPeople Before ProfitMore On Derry City and Strabane District CouncilNI was ‘undersold’ by Government’s levelling-up fund, insists CampbellNI rates explainer: Why are they rising and where is your money going Bigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsCouncil withholds £ Good Relations funding from Castlederg loyalist bandPolice in Derry investigate ‘unnotied parade’ not connected to commemorationsMost ReadPO Ferries confirm  staff have been made redundant after firm made £m lossHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleSchools’ Cup Final: Ben McFarlane the Methody hero as superb second-half comeback earns them record th title with victory over CampbellSt Patrick’s Day : Dublin parade in picturesTop VideosPlayPO Ferries sparks fury after sacking  workersPlayMethodist College beat Campbell in last moments of Schools CupPlayVideo: St Patrick#s Day parade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandSafety fears raised as PO Ferries replaces seafarers with agency workersProtest at Larne Harbour on Friday afternoon over sacking of  PO Ferries staffLarne boss Tiernan Lynch urges his side to rediscover killer touch as race for Europe gathers paceDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson and Paul Givan to run in Lagan Valley constituency in upcoming Assembly electionFans fuelled the Giants’ belief, say Lake and SoyLatestSix Nations silverware at stake in Dublin – Ireland v Scotland talking pointsUK security was not compromised by hoax calls, says ministerRussian strikes hit Lviv as Vladimir Putin makes only ‘minimal progress’US firm Sycamore Partners mulls takeover deal for Ted BakerSafety fears raised as PO Ferries replaces seafarers with agency workers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessSportLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

plans for a major walking trail which passes through Down District have received a pound, boost.A key component of the planned Columban Way is to develop ldquopilgrimage walking such as that found at Spainrsquos Camino de Santiago and at many other trails across Europe, with the trail highlighting Northern Irelandrsquos ancient heritage, including major Neolithic and early Christian sites along the way.It has been confirmed that a pound, grant has made available by the David Cross Foundation to produce a business case with costings to identy and develop the Columban Way from Dundrum to the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick and from there to Comber by repurposing and upgrading sections of the former Ulster Way which was abandoned in the s.St Columbanus was one of the best-known of hundreds of Irish monks following in the footsteps of Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity, literacy and learning to Central and Northern Europe in the sixth century.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright mdash who is an enthusiastic supporter of the new trail mdash said ii took St Columbanus  years to complete the journey from Bangor to Bobbio in Italy and he travelled more than , miles, mostly on foot.He is leading the local aspect of the project alongside Charlie Reid from Bangor, with both writing extensively on walks around Ireland and are committee members of Friends of Columbanus. They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe. It traces the route from Mount Leinster to Bangor through eight European countries to Bobbio in Italy, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoIt is instructive to see how rapidly other countries have rolled out sections of the trail since  and the th anniversary of Columbanus. Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished monument..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Council set to review museum joint curator restructure role  ","story":"THE controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place.

I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives. Itrsquos a privilege to be helping people at some of their worst times of their lives.She and her husband are looking forward in several weeks time to welcoming Corinne home from the US for the first since the pandemic.Dr Smith intends to continue to remain on the board of two local charities, MyMy in Newcastle and RIOT in Dundrum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Patrick Kielty’s love for Northern Ireland  ","story":"PATRICK Kielty has talked about his le, his loves, his passion for Northern Ireland and growing up in Dundrum.Patrick was interviewed by Gerry Kelly last Wednesday night as part of the lsquoIn Conversationrsquo series at the Saint Patrick Centre.He also revealed his thoughts on fatherhood, Brexit and the peace process.Reflecting on his childhood, Patrick recalled the terrible news of the murder of his father, Jack, and how looking back it seemed odd that there wasone bus for one community to go to school and another for the other.ldquoBrexit really was a wake-up call for me, he said and outlined his determination to find common ground. ldquoWeird and wonderful things happen when you decide to share.Patrick also described how he had jumped on a plane after a late night telephone call to his now-we Cat Deely and surprised her the next day in Los Angeles for her birthday lunch.ldquoThe taxi driver from the airport turned to me and said lsquoDo you want me to wait for you rsquo.Even after almost ten years of marriage he said he couldnt believe his luck and joked that being on the red carpet with his we, who is so successful in America, sometimes made people think ldquohes someone sponsored by a charity tagging along.The St Patrickrsquos Choral Society, who are celebrating their th anniversary this year, sang at the sold-out event mdash their first public engagement in over two years.St Patrickrsquos Grammar School student Eva Rowan, who hasjust won the BBC School Young Soloist of the Year competition, performed as part of the evening.The next in the series of events is a conversation on April  with Richard Moore, who was blinded by a rubber bullet in Derry in .Having forgiven and befriended Charles, the soldier who shot him, he has been celebrated world wide as a peace maker by the like of the Dalai Lama and is often described as the lsquoDerry Lamarsquo.Charles will also be part of the conversation by videolink.

The closure of much of the travel sector inevitably caused lasting damage to the industry.Another relevant issue is the outworkings of Brexit. Critics of the UK departure from the EU love to talk of consequences such as the reduced flow of immigrant labour, but there was in fact always a coherent case to be made in favour of the very opposite — strictly controlled external UK borders and increasing reliance on domestic employees, partly achieved by wooing some of the economically inactive population back into jobs. In core respects, such a vision is the very opposite of PO’s apparent blueprint for its future as a ferry company.Companies at times have to slash overheads. They even go unavoidably bust. But they should do all they can to ensure a slow and transparent transition to any new dispensation.Meanwhile, as an absolute minimum gesture the PO severance package needs to be generous, as it was implied yesterday it will be.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Whilst customers have been directed to Belfast Port in the short term, they will not have the capacity to ramp up operations in a sufficient manner to accommodate demand.With over half of all our freight moving through Larne Port, this announcement will also cause supply problems for companies and supermarkets in Northern Ireland, as well as those firms based here who sell to Great Britain. The chief executive of PO has assured us that there will be no redundancies in the Port of Larne and that the company will be making an investment in the future to enhance the attractiveness of the port. Whilst this is welcome, it does not make yesterday’s announcement and the manner in which it was done any more acceptable.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Picture by Martin NangleNo design drawings for the structure have survived and finding information on the ad hoc aesthetic constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in stages over  proved dficult for a team of researchers who are staging an event related to the security barriers.Theatre company Kabosh, in collaboration with Professor Kate Catterall from the University of Texas, will present ‘Drawing the Ring of Steel’ this coming Thursday. Taking place at each of the Ring of Steel’s former main entrance and exit points into and out of the city centre – Donegall Place, Royal Avenue, Castle Street and High Street – this free -hour theatrical event aims to facilitate storytelling across communities and between generations.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.James Bamford, a freelance consultant designing and producing maps, got involved in the project after hearing a talk from Kate about the security infrastructure that surrounded Belfast city centre during the Troubles. He said: “I didn’t know much about this and was interested in finding out more. “As part of the talk, Kate took us on a tour to see what remains of the ring. We got talking and she mentioned her project and how it would be great to have a mapping interface showing what was where, when.” He continued: “I think that the Ring of Steel is a really interesting phenomenon, not just in what it represented at the time, but also in how it disappeared and is remembered by those who were there. “From a built heritage and urban geography perspective, it’s quite a unique thing that although quite recent, belongs to a totally dferent time.” He added: “I spent a lot of time making phone calls and submitting FOI requests – to organisations like PSNI, MOD, NI Office, Belfast City Council, academics, local historical organisations – and had no joy at all. It was like a barrier came up, ironically, and this was still a complicated topic that none of the authorities were prepared to discuss. “The only lead I did manage to come across in my many attempts to get info from local authorities in Belfast was Robert Heslip - Tourism, Culture, Heritage and Arts Officer with Belfast City Council.“Robert was very helpful and pointed me towards the National Archives where I did find most of what I needed.“I felt like I’d stuck gold when I walked into the reading room and the files I’d ordered were piled high on the table.“I used the British Newspaper Archive to find relevant press articles and I also managed to source some great material from local photographers who were active at the time. “I spent time walking around the city centre getting a feel for how it was all organised and spotting the slight remnants that still exist – holes in walls, shreds of wire, bollards that have replaced gates, etc. “This gave me some insight into how Belfast city centre is still somehow affected by the ring, how it sort of echoes still today in the subtle isions between what was outside, and what was within.”Professor Kate Catterall was born and raised in Belfast and has direct personal experience of the Ring of Steel.She said: “For over  years during the conflict, the series of gates, fences, turnstiles, search stations and blocked roads known as the Ring of Steel became an increasingly prominent feature of the urban environment in Belfast. “Staffed by both civilian searchers and armed security personnel, the cordon had a signicant impact on the daily lives of all who passed in and out of the city centre every day, to work, shop or socialise.“Ongoing development since the  Peace Agreement has erased much of the evidence of the ‘Ring of Steel’, and only traces remain today to show that it ever existed. This work aims to create a record of what was a singular and largely unrecorded episode in Belfast’s recent history.”Mapper James added: “I do know from talking to Kate that she has put so much work into making [this event] happen and that she is hoping to capture memories from people and create a sort of archive of what le was like then. “I imagine it might bring out some expressions of feeling for this dficult period, and maybe serve as a kind of cathartic experience for the city and people who remember it.”On Thursday, at each of the four ‘Drawing the Ring of Steel’ sites, performers will redraw the lines of the security checkpoints and barriers and enact choreographed search motions. Other performers in s dress will interact with the public asking them questions about their memories or knowledge of the ‘Ring of Steel’ and collecting their stories. Stories which are recorded from audience members on the day of the piece will be transcribed, reviewed, anonymised and featured on the project website ringofsteel-belfast. Paula McFetridge, Artistic Director of Kabosh, said: “This event aims to highlight how far Belfast’s city centre has developed from those times, into an inclusive shared space.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe TV watchdog said RT’s licensee, ANO TV Novosti, is “not fit and proper” to hold a licence amid  ongoing investigations into the “due impartiality” of its programmes.A statement released by the regulator on Friday said: “We consider the volume and potentially serious nature of the issues raised within such a short period to be of great concern – especially given RT’s compliance history, which has seen the channel fined £, for previous due impartiality breaches.We have revoked RT’s licence to broadcast in the UK with immediate effect.We do not consider RT to be fit and proper to hold a UK licence and cannot be satisfied that it can be a responsible broadcaster.Read about our decision ⬇️https:t.co LWKtMxaCQm pic BBTyqrHXo— OfcomMarch , “In this context, we launched a separate investigation to determine whether ANO TV Novosti is fit and proper to retain its licence to broadcast.”Ofcom said the decision to suspend the licence came amid ongoing investigations into RT’s news and current affairs coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson also having previously called for an Ofcom review.RT is currently off air in the UK due to sanctions imposed.Ofcom said it noted new laws in Russia which “effectively criminalise any independent journalism that departs from the Russian state’s own news narrative”, particularly in relation to the invasion of Ukraine.It added: “We consider that, given these constraints, it appears impossible for RT to comply with the due impartiality rules of our broadcasting code in the circumstances.“We have concluded that we cannot be satisfied that RT can be a responsible broadcaster in the current circumstances. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously called for an Ofcom review into RT .remove“Ofcom is therefore revoking RT’s licence to broadcast with immediate effect.”The media watchdog went on: “We take seriously the importance, in our democratic society, of a broadcaster’s right to freedom of expression and the audience’s right to receive information and ideas without undue interference.“We also take seriously the importance of maintaining audiences’ trust and public confidence in the UK’s broadcasting regulatory regime.”Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: “Freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high.“Following an independent regulatory process, we have today found that RT is not fit and proper to hold a licence in the UK.“As a result we have revoked RT’s UK broadcasting licence.”RT’s deputy editor-in-chief, Anna Belkina, said Ofcom’s decision to suspend the broadcaster’s UK licence has “robbed” the British public of access to information.In a statement, she said: “Ofcom has shown the UK public, and the regulatory community internationally, that, despite a well-constructed facade of independence, it is nothing more than a tool of government, bending to its media-suppressing will.“By ignoring RT’s completely clean record of four consecutive years and stating purely political reasons tied directly to the situation in Ukraine and yet completely unassociated to RT’s operations, structure, management or editorial output, Ofcom has ly judged RT to not be ‘fit and proper’ and in doing so robbed the UK public of access to information.”Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries welcomed Ofcom’s decision, saying RT’s “lies and propaganda” have “absolutely no place on our screens”.The Cabinet minister previously told MPs she hoped the TV watchdog’s investigations into “due impartiality” at the Kremlin-backed broadcaster would result in the removal of its licence.In a statement on Twitter, she said: “I welcome @Ofcom’s decision and it’s right that our independent regulator has taken action against RT.“The outlet’s lies and propaganda, where victims are cast as the aggressors and the brutality of Russia’s actions are concealed, have absolutely no place on our screens.”I welcome @Ofcom’s decision and it’s right that our independent regulator has taken action against RT.The outlets lies and propaganda, where victims are cast as the aggressors and the brutality of Russia’s actions are concealed, have absolutely no place on our screens. https:t.co PltmvZo— Nadine DorriesMarch , Similarly, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said Labour welcomes Ofcom’s decision to revoke RT’s licence.She said: “Labour has long called for Russia Today,Putin’s propaganda factory, to have its licence revoked. We welcome this decision, though it should have come much sooner.“Tackling state disinformation is vital to protect our security and democracy, yet inexplicably the Online Safety Bill published yesterday by Government fails to mention this.“Ministers must strengthen the Bill and ensure that state actors trying to undermine our country are thwarted.”The RT news website is currently still up and running but its YouTube channel has been taken down..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Russian broadcaster RT us UK licence revoked by Ofcom article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call  — Rt. Hon Ben Wallace MPMarch , He ordered an investigation into the security breach, but serious questions remain about Whitehall security after Ms Patel said the same thing happened to her earlier in the week.Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said that Mr Wallace was “very cross” as it should not have been allowed to happen.But he expressed confidence that the Defence Secretary and Ms Patel would have known not to discuss sensitive security matters on a system such as Teams which the Russians could easily listen into.“Ben’s suspicions were aroused when somebodyhe was who he said he was would have known full well that you don’t discuss military movements on Teams because the Russians are watching,” Mr Heappey told the BBC Radio  Today programme.“Priti, like Ben, day in day out is dealing with matters of national security.

However long it went on, the content would have been appropriate to a Teams call.”Mr Wallace said he became suspicious and terminated the call after “several misleading questions”.The PA news agency understands he was put through to the video call which lasted around  minutes by officials, rather than being dialled directly on his phone.Ms Patel later disclosed that she had also been targeted although the Home Office declined to give further details.Mr Wallace went public because of fears that Russia may try to distort any footage or audio material from the call for propaganda purposes.The video call was set up after an email, purportedly from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy, was sent to a Government department and then forwarded to the Ministry of Defence.The Defence Secretary was put through to the “prime minister of Ukraine”, posing with the country’s flag behind him.After initial introductions and thanks for the UK’s support, Mr Wallace is understood to have became suspicious as the man started asking questions about British policy and eventually urged the Defence Secretary to shout slogans.The level of sophistication involved in the hoax has convinced Government sources that it was a Russian plot..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK security was not compromised by hoax calls, says minister article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It’s fantastic that we can come together once again as a community, and it’s just the beginning of a packed programme of major festivities being rolled out in . I’m delighted that this year’s Spring Carnival also features the Unboxed Festival of Creativity, and I would really encourage people to check out this fabulous showcase in Guildhall Square.“I know our businesses will be particularly pleased to see people back out on the streets, and back through their doors after such a challenging time. With large crowds expected, I want to appeal to everyone to please give each other plenty of space and to consider taking a lateral flow test for extra peace of mind before attending.“Check out the traffic and travel information before you go to plan your journey andpossible use public transport or walk to the event to help reduce congestion in the city centre.

That’s according to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, who was speaking after the ferry operator sacked  staff yesterday. It could be another week before the firm’s ships will be able to operate again and Mr Poots has warned that goods normally coming here wont be able to get in. There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which wont get out. About % of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us, he told BBC NIs The View. Meanwhile the Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon MLA, has expressed her concern at the actions by PO Ferries and the impact locally. The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London. With the Economy Minister I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efddbcbbdebbdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eecbffbfaddcea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
