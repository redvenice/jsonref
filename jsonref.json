It is not accidental damage.\u0027A setter\u0027s tool appears to have been used to ease back the claws, or pliers suitable for removing gemstones.\u0027In my opinion, the evidence shows that the stone has been intentionally removed.\u0027          Fight: Sylvia Jarrett, from Alcester, Warwickshire, with husband WilliamBut Sylvia, who\u0027s been a Co-op customer for 20 years, says: \u0027I have no idea what a setter\u0027s tool is, let alone how to use one.\u0027 She thinks the Co-op was suspicious as this was her third claim for jewellery in 12 months.One was for a pair of earrings worth £450, which went missing when they moved house. The second was for her husband\u0027s wedding ring, worth £460, which slipped off and was lost after he\u0027d shed a great deal of weight.Desperate to prove the claims were just the result of bad luck, Sylvia asked her local jeweller for its opinion. Its report stated: \u0027Three of the claws have moved from their original position, which could be indicative of having caught on something, which would result in their being pulled out of shape.\u0027Further in-depth examination shows marks to the bottom of the claws, which is expected normal wear and tear with a ring worn every day for ten years.\u0027Sylvia took her case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, however it sided with the Co-op.It said with contradictory reports, it must decide which was more reliable. As the Co-op had presented a more detailed report, \u0027based on the balance of probabilities\u0027 it ruled the insurer had not acted unfairly.Close to giving up, Sylvia then had a flash of inspiration. When her husband bought the ring in Gibraltar, it had been resized with the same jeweller.\u0027I wondered if they could shed some light on why there were marks from a setter\u0027s tool on the claws,\u0027 she says.          Since April,  some 800 complaints have been made to the Financial Ombudsman regarding home contents insurance. Around one in four were upheld in favour of the policyholderAfter tracking down the jeweller, she was delighted to find they still had a record of her ring. In an email, they said: \u0027Our jewellers remove the centre stone of engagement rings prior to sizing them in order to prevent any damage. The ring shank is put through a variety of different manipulations (heated, soldered, plated, etc) to reach the right size. While our jewellers are masters at what they do, they may leave evidence of their work on the claws of the ring.\u0027With this new evidence, Sylvia was sure the Co-op would see that she wasn\u0027t lying. But the insurer refused to change its mind — and she had missed the 30-day deadline for appealing the Ombudsman\u0027s decision.Consumer expert James Daley, of Fairer Finance, says it isn\u0027t right that the Co-op has taken a stance of guilty until proven innocent. Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/05/18/0337D6B70000044D-0-image-a-22_1551812030792.jpg","title":"Italian company buys iconic British sports car maker Morgan","story":"     A Morgan Aero 8 sports car is pictured at the Geneva Car Show in Switzerland in March 2000          Cars at the Morgan factory in Malvern, Worcestershire, are pictured in September 2005The firm produces around 700 handcrafted sports cars a year, recording sales of £33.8 million and profits of £3.2 million in 2018.It was set up in 1910 by Henry Frederick Stanley Morgan, who initially built just one car for himself before spotting a commercial opportunity.The world\u0027s first 300MPH road car: Koenigsegg reveals the...Would you get on a driverless BUS?

Even though Falconer was a friend of her late husband Henry, a High Court judge, Hodge claimed the former Lord Chancellor had bullied her and even asked her to apologise to Corbyn after she had accused the Labour leader to his face of being ‘anti-Semitic and racist’.

The youngster is pictured with his mother Layla who says raising her baby to be vegan has been met with derision from someTo the parents of fussy eaters, the idea of a child who begs for broccoli and happily tucks into a pile of beans, pulses and tofu sounds like an impossible dream. Surely, such a child does not exist?Well, he does. One-year-old Dylan Bammeke’s favourite meal is dahl curry with rice or sweet potato mash, and you’ll never see him pulling a ‘yuck’ face when given a veggie stir-fry.Dylan eats this way because it’s all he has ever known. He may not be old enough to pronounce the word ‘vegan’ — but he is one. Toddler staples such as chicken nuggets, fish fingers or boiled egg and soldiers have never made their way on to his plate.Dylan’s mother, Layla, admits her decision to feed her son a plant-based diet has raised eyebrows. Is it morally right, or even healthy, to enforce such a strict eating regime on a growing child, many ask.Layla, 39, says raising her baby to be vegan has been met with derision from some.‘I’ve had people accuse me of child abuse, and had comments such as, “You should let him have the choice to eat meat,” and, “He won’t grow properly,”’ says Layla, a business studies student who’s been vegan since 2016.She lives in Woolwich, South-East London, with Dylan, 16 months, and her fiance Eddie, 50, a film director, who’s also vegan. Before weaning her son, Layla sought advice from her GP — and certainly her little boy is a picture of health, with sparkling eyes, glowing skin and weight and height just as they should be.Even so, Layla’s been stigmatised and has lost friends. ‘I’ve lost three friends who don’t agree with what they see as my “militant” ways. They were vile on social media, too, telling me I’d make my baby ill and that I’m denying him a choice in life.‘It’s interesting because my view is that I didn’t have a choice as a child. I was given meat and fish to eat and told to clean my plate. I expect Dylan to be curious and maybe even rebellious about meat in the future. I hope he understands why he’s vegan, and I will try not to freak out if he tries meat and dairy when he’s older.’There are an estimated 3.5 million vegans in the UK — 7 per cent of the population — who eschew meat, fish, dairy and any other products that derive from the killing of an animal or from agricultural practices that exploit living creatures.This includes honey and foods containing such ingredients as gelatine or animal fats.Food manufacturers have also responded to soaring demand for vegan foods, with companies such as Babease and Piccolo offering vegan food for little ones. But while there are milk alternatives for adults, there is still no vegan baby formula milk in the UK.But just how safe is it to raise a child as a vegan and is it really possible for them to get the vital nutrients they need? While many experts note that a vegan diet can be perfectly healthy for children, they also warn that it must be done properly.A study of veganism in children at University College London concluded that a lack of nutrients such as vitamin B12, calcium, zinc and high-quality protein (found in meat and dairy) can lead to malnutrition and ‘irreversible damage’ to their nervous systems.Professor Mary Fewtrell warned: ‘It is difficult to ensure a healthy and balanced vegan diet in young infants. The risks of getting it wrong can include irreversible cognitive damage and, in the extreme, death.’  Left: Vegan mother and son  Amy Venables and son Bodhi, 13 months. Right: Karris McCulloch pictured with her family Casey, 7,  and Tyler, 2, who are veganPaediatric dietitian Lucy Upton agrees that while a vegan diet shouldn’t be labelled good or bad, it requires very careful attention.‘Children need lots of energy and very nutrient dense foods in order to grow, for bone and teeth accrual, and for their brains to develop.‘A wholefood vegan diet is typically low in fat and high in fibre, and essentially low in calories, which has the potential to affect how much energy and nutrients children are able to consume.‘When reviewing the diet of a vegan child, I scrutinise it to ensure it includes the nutrients which are essential for children — namely iron, calcium, vitamin B12, iodine, selenium, vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids. They are harder to obtain from a vegan diet, so many youngsters require supplements.‘Iron deficiency can also impact on children’s weight, appetite and energy, and increase the risk of coughs and colds.‘Too little protein can lead to stunted growth, while too much fibre can cause children to feel full too quickly, stopping them getting enough food.’Thirty-six-year-old Iida van der Byl-Knoefel, from Surrey, went vegan four years ago in a quest for better health after being diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis.When her son Johannes was born in August 2017, she was resolute that he’d eventually be weaned onto a vegan diet — a decision that her non-vegan husband Fred, 36, a banker, supported.She says other people’s concerns about them raising their son as a vegan are usually dismissed when they see 19-month-old Johannes.‘When people see my gorgeous baby — how energetic he is and how much he loves his food — their reservations usually disappear.’Contrary to popular myth, vegans can and do breastfeed their children, since there is no cruelty involved and a mother’s milk, unlike a cow’s, was intended for human babies. Johannes will be breastfed until he is two, meaning that Iida, who is the author of vegan cookbook A Kitchen Fairytale, can be confident her baby is getting the nutrients he needs.‘I don’t give him supplements, as breast milk is so full of goodness,’ she says. ‘I also make sure his diet is varied to ensure his nutritional needs are met. For example, he has a green smoothie pretty much every morning. This contains leafy greens such as kale and spinach, as well as hemp seeds, barley grass powder, orange and banana.‘He also regularly eats all colours of lentils, different types of beans, wholegrains, nuts and lots of fruit and veg. His weight is perfect for his age. He’s healthy, pink-cheeked and has a terrific appetite.’ Of course, at this age, controlling what Johannes eats is a doddle compared with when children start nursery and school.          Thirty-six-year-old Iida van der Byl-Knoefel, from Surrey, went vegan four years ago in a quest for better health after being diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis. When her son Johannes was born in August 2017, she was resolute that he’d eventually be weaned onto a vegan diet — a decision that her non-vegan husband Fred, 36, a banker, supported More challenging still will be play dates and parties brimming with ham sandwiches and fairy cakes smothered in buttercream icing.‘Recently, a friend invited us to her child’s party and asked beforehand if Johannes could eat cake with buttercream,’ says Iida. ‘We prefer that he doesn’t and I made buns with cashew and maple cream so that he didn’t miss out.‘But I’ve accepted that as Johannes gets older, he may want to try a burger or a non-vegan pizza with his friends. It won’t be the end of the world. I wouldn’t want him ever to think I forced him into being a vegan.’But it’s not all plain sailing, as vegan mum Amy Venables found recently when her 16-month-old son, Bodhi, started being picky at mealtimes.‘Although generally he eats a greater variety of foods than his non-vegan friends, there are times I’ve felt fraught because all he wants is pasta and bread,’ says Amy, 35, a marketing manager from Basingstoke who’s been vegan for six years.‘I reassure myself that all parents have similar issues, whether their toddlers are vegan or not, and I make sure Bodhi takes a daily multivitamin.‘But a spate of recent birthday parties has made me think more about the future because I don’t have vegan friends with children the same age.‘Although some friends do accommodate his vegan diet, over the next few years there will be playdates and parties and one thing we’ll have to overcome is that Bodhi will want what other kids are eating.‘I don’t want him to feel like he’s different or missing out, so I’ll probably take vegan party food for him.’Bodhi goes to nursery three days a week, where the on-site chef makes him vegan alternatives at mealtimes, and Amy’s in-laws have him the other two days. Though not vegan themselves, they are, she says ‘brilliant’ at researching and providing food for her son.‘I’ve had some people ask, “Are you going to make him eat vegan food?” — which is unfair as it’s no different to others giving their toddlers what they eat.‘When Bodhi starts to comprehend that what we eat is different, I’ll explain to him in an age-appropriate manner why. I’m passionate about animal welfare, so raising Bodhi in a compassionate manner is important, and veganism is very much a lifestyle.‘If he ever decides to eat meat, I’ll be disappointed but respectful. But I’ll never cook it in the house, because that’s against our family principles.‘I’m hoping that by the time he’s ten, there will be a lot more vegan kids around. Unfortunately, a lot of vegans do currently fit the hippy, right-on stereotype, which doesn’t do much to help the image of veganism for those of us who are just quietly health and environmentally conscious.’Natwest apologises after a customer who applied for a loan...Woolworths will stop selling $1-a-litre milk at supermarkets...Cory Booker admits it will take \u0027a lot longer\u0027 for Americans...Share this articleHowever, dietitian Lucy Upton points out that there’s a misleading perception that the vegan diet is super-healthy. ‘Data shows that a lot of people quote health as the reason why they become vegan and certainly it can be healthy,’ she says. ‘But there are also plenty of processed and high-calorie vegan foods on the market now, plus “accidental” vegan foods which would be unhealthy in large quantities, such as certain cookies, crisps and sweets.‘It’s so important that parents become familiar with food labels and look for vegan-friendly foods that contain good amounts of protein and calcium, and are fortified with iron and vitamin B12.’One vegan mum who’s an expert in this respect is Karris McCulloch, 33, who with her husband Scott, 36, founded TheVeganKind, an online vegan supermarket and monthly subscription box service. They live in Glasgow with their daughter Casey, seven, and son Tyler, two.‘I was in the early days of being a vegan when Casey was a baby so fed her a mixture of breast milk and non-vegan formula, but at a year old we decided to wean her on to a totally vegan diet,’ recalls Karris.‘We thoroughly researched what nutrients she’d need, and we did have a few queries from acquaintances about whether she’d get enough calcium or protein.‘But we’re lucky because both kids love healthy vegan foods. Tyler’s favourites are avocado and broccoli and Casey loves kale and spinach.’But for vegan parents, the ‘picky’ stage — which Tyler is now going through — can be particularly worrying. ‘It bothers me when he throws his dinner on the floor as I’m conscious that I want him to get all the nutrients he needs,’ says Karris. ‘I give supplements to both children as a back-up, and I would do even if they weren’t vegan.‘My dad accidentally gave Casey soup with ham in it once, but I accept that these things happen occasionally. Most of our friends and family now understand and accommodate the children’s diets.’At nursery, Tyler has vegan alternatives at mealtimes such as bolognese made with soya mince. Casey takes a packed lunch of vegan sandwiches, fruit and crisps to school, because ‘other than beans on toast’ there are few options on the menu.‘I’ve written to the school to ask for better vegan options and have had a positive response,’ says Karris. ‘None of Casey’s friends are vegan or even veggie, and I worry about kids being mean to her for being different. So far, though, they’ve just been curious.‘At a soft-play centre a few weeks ago, her friends all had lollies containing carmine, which is essentially crushed up beetles. I explained to her that they contained insects and weren’t vegan, while offering her a vegan alternative.‘She understands that we don’t eat animals or animal products because we believe they’re not on this Earth for us to eat or use, but she doesn’t need to be scared by the gory details at this age.‘I don’t want our children ever to feel that we are forcing them to do something they don’t want to.‘But knowing what we do about the meat and dairy industry, and considering how easy it is to be vegan now, I doubt they’ll want to eat animals in the future.‘If they decide that veganism isn’t for them when they’re older, that will be their choice. But our home will always remain vegan.‘In the meantime, whatever reservations other people have about our lifestyle, my children are incredibly healthy, fizzing with energy, love food and have very few colds — and I’m certain that’s down to their vegan diet.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Upmarket London cafe sells rare coffee exported Yemen 15 CUP","story":"     Alain Ducasse poses with a cup of coffee.

Bonhams auctioneers alone set three new world records, including a bottle of rare 60-year-old Macallan Valerio Adami 1926 that sold in Edinburgh in October for £848,750 – equivalent to £42,000 per dram.The following month, a unique bottle of Macallan 1926, hand-painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon, was sold at Christie’s in London for £1.2million – breaking the £1million barrier for the first time.The incredible rise in values has been driven partly by the Asian market, as sales of Scotch whisky to India, China and Singapore rose by 44 per cent, 35 per cent and 24 per cent respectively, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.

Autumn decided she wanted to be girl when she was just seven years oldDuring the Easter holidays in 2017, Autumn decided she wanted to be a girl after coming home from a weekend with father Lloyd Norris, 39. They decided to let her continue as a girl for the Easter holidays, presuming it might just be that she wanted to role play.But when it became clear it wasn\u0027t role play at the end of the holidays, they ordered her a natural-looking wig and she decided to change her name to Autumn at home.At the same time, the couple were having meetings with Autumn\u0027s school about her bad behaviour - which they now think was brought on from the stress of her identifying as female at home but male at school.  Autumn\u0027s parent raise their son as their daughter and enjoy everything that comes with it - with Autumn (left, before her transition, and right, with her mother now) even discussing gender reassignment surgery and becoming a mother in the future          Mrs Norris, a tattoo artist, applies makeup to AutumnWhen the school said if Anthony wanted to come back the following term as Autumn they would support it, Mrs Norris said Autumn said yes \u0027before they have even finished the sentence\u0027.Since then, the nine-year-old has become Autumn full-time with her family, friends and classmates with her school formally changing her name and gender on their files.Now her parents raise their son as their daughter and enjoy everything that comes with it - with Autumn even discussing gender reassignment surgery and becoming a mother in future with her parents.Mrs Norris said: \u0027When Autumn first spoke to me, she got out of the bath and said she was not a boy any more, she was a girl.

The guide discovered the head of the Crusader had been severed from its mummified body and was missing.The head of a mummified nun, who died 300 years ago, had also been turned 180 degrees to face the wrong direction while a third mummy had been turned on its side.The Ven David Pierrepoint had a special word of thanks for the person who tipped off gardaí about the whereabouts of the items. “We’re extremely grateful that we have this back and now we can lay him to rest,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. He told of how he received a phone call from the Bridewell Garda station on Tuesday afternoon to say they had received a tip off and had recovered the head and the skull.“I immediately went to the station and examined the skull and the head, unfortunately they were quote saturated and damp and wet, so they’ve gone to the museum now to begin the process of trying to dry them out, but my fear is that once they start drying out they’ll just begin to crumble. “We’ll just have to wait and see, possibly we will have to recoffin them and reinter them in the vaults.”Archdeacon Pierrepoint said he did not know where the remains were recovered as this was on ongoing investigation. “Whoever the culprits are they may be able to use this as part of their arrest process.“The heads can be put back with the back with the body, the head of the Crusader was completely severed from the neck, spine, it’s very unlikely it can be reattached as such, but it can certainly be laid back in its proper place, whether it can ever be on view to the public again is something that we wait for the experts findings. We’re in their hands now.”Preservative qualityHe went on to explain that the vaults at St Michan’s have a preservative quality. “The vaults are always at 14 degrees temperature, that’s winter and summer, they say it’s from the tannin gas. The church was originally built on Oxmantown Bog and the tannin gas mixed with the limestone has this funny preserving qualities so while people have been buried there, no one knew until about 150 years ago that this preserving quality was there.“We have records for some of the people buried there, obviously there are family crypts there, as regards the Crusader who just know he is approximately 800 years which ties in with the Crusades, he was buried with his legs crossed which was standard. We know the nun for example was about 400 years old. Security“The sad part of it is that anybody would do such a thing. Anybody who would do this I don’t believe they’re in their right mind.“There was a break in at the crypt in 1996, that was just mindless vandalism by some youths. We have particularly good security, we have CCTV cameras, double doors both outside and inside the crypts and the people who did this came prepared to break open those doors.“The doors on the outside, each of them weighs about 60 kilos and one of them was taken off its hinges. That didn’t just happen.”He explained that the Parish can’t afford 24 hour security on site. “We’ve done everything we can security wise to keep it safe. “It is our intention to open the crypt to visitors because we have inherited this great treasure, not just for the parish, for the city and the nation and we maintain it, so it is our intention to have this available for all future generations in whatever form it can be.“Want to say thank you to so many people from across the globe who have expressed their concern and their support, thanks to the Gardaí, and thank you to whoever tipped the Gardaí off as to where we could find the head and the skull because we’re extremely grateful now that we have this back we can lay him to rest.”Archdeacon Pierrepoint said that St Michan’s is open for church services. “It’s back open since Monday for tourists including the crypts.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3816126.1551863604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit has arrived early irish hauliers face massive delays at customs","story":"Worried that Brexit would weigh heavy on their shoulders and aggravate already long traffic jams, angry French customs officers on Tuesday (March 5th) simulated increased checks in the northern French city of Calais.

Photograph: Philippe HuguenAFPHauliers in the UK and Ireland are predicting that a no deal Brexit is going to cause major problems for the haulage industry and for the general public.Irish truck driver Joe Droohan told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that Brexit had arrived early on Tuesday when he faced a delay of two and a half hours in the British port of Folkstone because of a work to rule by French customs staff.En route from the UK to France, he explained that following British emigration and security checks he then had to go through checks with French customs for the first time in “three to four years”. “Usually they just ask to look at the documents for the load, but they wanted to see documents for the truck, registration for the truck, permit for the truck and they checked the temperature in the fridge.“These are delaying tactics which are causing a fierce backlog. Brexit has arrived early. When Brexit comes in it will be twice as bad.”When he arrived in Calais, Mr Droohan said he saw a lane of trucks, which he clocked at 6.8km long, outside the port which included “a lot of Irish trucks.”Rob McKenzie of the British Road Haulage Association described Tuesday’s delays as ‘unpleasant.’“This was all about cutting through the noise, an attempt by the French customs staff to illustrate what it will be like if there’s a hard Brexit on the 29th of March.”He said there had been customs checks and permit checks on Tuesday, “things that don’t happen now will happen then. For Ireland a crucial land bridge will block up. Irish trucks will run into those delays.”The actions on Tuesday were both a trade union issue and a Brexit issue, he said, as French customs staff are demanding more staff and more pay. “This is a harbinger of what is to come,” he warned.Mr McKenzie said the British government’s preparations for Brexit were “shambolic, far too little, too late.”FarceA recent trial involving 80 trucks had been a farce he said as 10,000 trucks go through the UK port of Dover daily.“How could you possibly make that a useful test?“We are 17 working days from a potential no deal Brexit which will be very unfortunate indeed for truck drivers facing 20km long queues and for the rest of us who rely on supplies, 95 per cent of which come on trucks.”A number of hauliers took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the long tailbacks on both sides of the eurotunnel. The ‘Ciaran the Euro courier’ account posted on Tuesday that he had passed “over 20 miles of trucks queuing to get into the ferry port and Eurotunnel” after French customs at Calais implemented “full border checks on all freight as a trial run in case of no deal”. “Half these trucks will have been European delivering into Britain and half returning UK trucks after delivering into Europe,” he wrote. “Neither can afford to have these trucks tied up for days on end waiting to pass customs. Welcome to Brexit.”The same account later posted a map of northern France with the message: “Just to let you know the queue of trucks now stretches from BELGIUM to Calais . That’s about 40 miles . It’s closed . You cannot use the A16.”Tweeting on Wednesday morning, P\u0026ampQ ferries noted that while tourist traffic was free flowing, freights were experiencing delays before check in and the buffer zones in Calais and Dover were in use. DFDS Channel Freight posted shortly before 9am that traffic was “busy but currently free flowing”. It wrote that Dover-Dunkerque services were operating to the advertised schedule but that Dover-Calais services were operating to an advertised “refit” schedule. Another personal Twitter account, @bakerandgrower, tweeted that thousands of lorries were waiting on both sides of the tunnel. “French police in evidence but on M20 and care exit heavily obstructed. A sign of what is to come?”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

The former bank official says a chest left in the vault by a “spinster” in 1905  played a previously unknown role in the visit in 1995 of the then US president, Bill Clinton. Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Bank of Ireland official Jim Connolly recalls visiting the vaults of the bank’s College Green branch, which has operated since the Act of Union in 1801, and seeing “huge paintings... housed in pallets, travel chests, suitcases and trunks”.His guide during that 2003 visit, a bank official, told him that the majority of items stashed away remained unopened.“However, I was shown two items where she could reveal the contents. One was a cabinet whose locked door had broken open in a move.“Inside was a silver ornament, not pretty, of an elephant and a palm tree, with an inscription along the lines of ‘presented to Charles Cameron by John Gerard on his retirement as Grandmaster of the Freemasons’.”However, it was a chest left in the College Green vault by a “spinster” in 1905 that played a previously unknown role in the visit in 1995 of the then US president, Bill Clinton, when tens of thousands gathered to hear him speak on College Green.AskanceDescribing it as a travel trunk such as “you’d expect to see on the Titanic – huge, with the capacity of a wheelie bin”, Connolly says US secret service agents looked askance at it when they carried out security checks before Clinton arrived.The president’s podium was directly over the vaults: “In addition to welding shut all the manholes and removing the litter bins in the vicinity, the American secret service also vetted the vaults, and it was at this point that a sniffer dog took issue with the spinster’s chest.“As a result, it was opened. It was opened again for my visit and I’m one of a privileged few ever to see the contents. I would quite happily have spent hours going through this one item,” he remembers.Ceremonial swordInside, the chest contained a ceremonial sword with “a jewel-encrusted butt and lots of army regalia, including a hat that looked like it dated from the time of Napoleon, magnificently preserved in an oversized royal blue tin”.A loaded hand-pistol “that caused the sniffer dog so much angst” was removed: “I have no idea where that is now. But, unless the spinster has come back to claim it in the interim, the chest is still in the vault.”Even more intriguingly, the College Green vault contains a wooden chest deposited in the 1870s, which is bound in chains: “Rope is weaved through the links and is knotted at points and each of these knots has candle wax poured on them.”Describing it as “real Mutiny on the Bounty stuff – if you think of pirates’ treasure you’re on the right track”, Connolly goes on: “Whoever they are, they went to an awful lot of trouble to ensure that their item would not be opened.”Treasure trovesIt has been 20 years since Connolly’s interest in the treasure troves that lie hidden and forgotten was sparked, when he first stood in the vault of the Bank of Ireland’s branch in Rathmines in Dublin, surrounded by dozens of parcels locked boxes chests cases and envelopes.Some of the Rathmines vault’s contents were items placed there by customers in the early 1900s. “If they never came back the item is still sitting on a shelf in the safe. I pointed out to the manager that the client was likely to be dead. He pointed out that his job was to keep the item safe.”The Rathmines and College Green branches are not unique. Thousands of items lie dust-covered in vaults around the country. Now, an Oireachtas committee is to investigate what can and should be done about them.Under Irish law, deposit and current accounts, savings certificates and savings bonds held in institutions such as banks, building societies and An Post are considered “dormant” and handed over to the State if they have lain idle for 15 years.Financial institutions are required under the 2001 law to make “reasonable effort” to find the account-holder before dormancy is declared. If they do manage to get in touch, then the clock on the account’s life is once again set at zero.Give evidenceToday, Connolly will give evidence to an Oireachtas Committee for Rural and Community Development, which has overseen dormant account laws, alongside officials from the Central Bank and the departments of Rural and Community Development, Finance and Justice.The treasure trove does not cover the kind of safety deposit boxes better known to the public from films, which began to be introduced in Irish bank vaults from the 1970s, where records ensure that descendants can be traced.Committee member Éamon Ó Cuív of Fianna Fáil says: “I’d love to see these items on display, out of the cobwebs. This is really exciting. Right here in the banks there’s literally hoards of stuff. I’m sure some of the items are documents. The key is getting in to see what is there.”*AIB urges customers with “goods in safekeeping boxes to collect their belongings”, while the Bank of Ireland cautions: “We are unable to open items in order to assess contents and ownership due to the contractual terms under which the property is held.”*Correction: an earlier verson of this story referred to hordes rather than hoards"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3816303.1551876147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"socialists clash over tactics for competing with sinn f%C3%A9in","story":"The challenge of how to compete with Sinn Féin for left wing votes is at the centre of differences in political strategy between leading members of the Socialist Party. Dublin South West TD Paul Murphy advocates challenging Sinn Féin with a so-called “united front” approach. Mr Murphy explains this approach in detail in a paper called “The United Front method and putting forward a Socialist Programme today”, published on November 20th. In explaining the united front approach, Mr Murphy cites a definition from the “Executive Committee of the Communist International Theses on the United Front”.By this definition, the tactic is “nothing other than the proposal made by the Communists to all workers, whether they are members of other parties or groups or of none, to fight alongside them, to defend the elementary and vital interests of the working class against the bourgeoisie. “Every action for even the smallest demand is a source of revolutionary education, because the experience of combat will convince the working people of the necessity of the revolution, and will demonstrate the meaning of Communism to them.”He says this can be “applied to today’s situation to win over workers looking towards other organisations”. Mr Murphy also cites Trotsky in expanding his argument, adding: “Trotsky made it clear that even in a specific united front, there was a need for clear differentiation from other forces.”‘No common platform’He then quotes Trotsky thus: “No common platform with the Social Democracy, or with the leaders of the German trade unions, no common publications, banners, placards! March separately, but strike together! Agree only how to strike, whom to strike and when to strike! Such an agreement can be concluded even with the devil himself, with his grandmother, and even with Noske and Grezesinsky. On one condition, not to bind one’s hands.”In effect, Mr Murphy says this would allow Socialists join in common action with others “in order to achieve real gains for the working class” while maintaining their own independence as the “revolutionary” party. “The united front method also means revolutionaries fight in that movement to expose the limitations of the other organisations and ideas, to prove the superiority of revolutionary ideas and seek to win a majority to a revolutionary programme and the leadership of the revolutionary party.”Sinn Féin did not initially favour of non-payment of the charges, as the Socialists had.“Here, a very critical and ‘hard’ approach was taken to Sinn Féin, on the concrete issue of water charges to illustrate in practice the weaknesses of their programme and approach, and win over their supporters,” Mr Murphy says. “A consistent element of our campaign was appealing to Sinn Féin supporters to vote for us to apply pressure on Sinn Féin ’to change their position’ and ‘join with us in campaigning to build a mass movement of non-payment’. Weak position “In the election leaflet the comrades themselves quote, it clearly says: ‘The election of Paul Murphy would make it clear to Sinn Féin that a weak position on Water Charges in the future will not be tolerated’. “This was a theme running through much of our election posters, leaflets and other material.“Failing to understand the importance of applying the united front method has resulted in mistakes in the past in relation to Sinn Féin, and can result in mistakes in the future.”The byelection is also used in a paper from others in the movement, replying to similar arguments that had been previously made by Mr Murphy. This paper, is called: “A brief contribution on some political issues mentioned by PM” and is written by Laura F, Stephen B, Kevin M, Joe H, and dated October 10th last. The authors are understood to be Laura Fitzgerald, Stephen Boyd, Kevin McLoughlin and Joe Higgins. “We should be hesitant about using labels if they don’t accurately convey what we mean,” they say. “We don’t have the time to go into more generally, but will use the example DSW By-Election just given to try to illustrate the difficulty with the term. “There was no question of a unified approach with Sinn Féin on the water charges. There was obviously an attempt by us to win over people who voted for them by using the water charges and austerity issues, but there is a major difference in the content and tone of our campaign.”Differences also emerge between Mr Murphy and his colleagues on how to describe Sinn Féin. SectarianMr Murphy says: “The comrades…respond to my description of Sinn Féin as a nationalist, pro-capitalist party saying the following: ‘Of course they are “nationalist, pro-capitalist party’, the reality is that Sinn Féin are a bourgeois nationalist party - but of fundamental importance to any political description of Sinn Féin is that they are a sectarian party. A party which currently plays a sectarian role in the North - whose armed wing in the past waged an inidual terrorist armed struggle, that was overtly sectarian and at times directly targeted working class Protestants.”Mr Murphy then adds further description is needed on the term “bourgeois nationalist party” the Socialist have used for Sinn Féin.“It seems to me that further clarification may be needed. If the comrades mean it is a capitalist nationalist party, i.e. one with a pro-capitalist nationalist programme, as demonstrated by their implementation of austerity and sectarian policies in Northern Ireland, then I completely agree. “However, if the term ‘bourgeois nationalist party’ is used to indicate a party which represents the nationalist aspirations of the bourgeoisie, then it is not a precise description of Sinn Féin. While in the North, Sinn Féin has support amongst a section of the Catholic capitalist class, in the South, no significant section of the capitalist class supports Sinn Féin.”Mr Murphy also corrects his comrades on their understanding of the “united front”. “The comrades begin with an inaccurate historical description of the united front as ‘tactics the Comintern and revolutionary parties adopted in general towards the mass organisations of the working class in the 1920s and 1930s’,” he says. Bolsheviks“It was in fact central to the success of the Bolsheviks in 1917, and was fought for by Lenin in particular. The most well known example is the united front struggle proposed by the Bolsheviks to stop the Kornilov coup against the Kerensky government in August 1917, using ‘Kerensky as a gun-rest to shoot Kornilov.’“It wasn’t until later, in particular at the Third and Fourth Congresses of the Communist International in the early 1920s, that the united front was theorised. The same process took place with the transitional method and the workers’ government slogan, both of which were implemented by the Bolsheviks in 1917, for example in Lenin’s ‘The Impending Catastrophe and How to Fight It’, and the ‘Down with the Ten Capitalist Ministers’ slogan demanding that the Mensheviks and SRs form a government without the participation of the capitalist parties.“The comrades are unfortunately wrong to suggest that the united front was then adopted by the Communist Parties. In fact, the tragedy of the 1920s and 30s is precisely that it was not fully adopted or properly implemented.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3815356.1551808287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands of boxes of valuables lie unclaimed in bank vaults","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t ‘There are potentially thousands of abandoned safety deposit boxes in banks around the country,’ said Fine Gael TD Joe Carey. File photograph: StockbyteGetty ImagesThousands of boxes, chests and paintings, many of which could hold valuable papers and treasures dating back 200 years, lie unclaimed in bank vaults in the State, an Oireachtas inquiry will hear today.Under banking legislation, accounts that have lain idle for 15 years are handed over to the State and used for good causes, but no similar legislation covers items that have been deposited in vaults.Some of the valuables are stored in safety deposit boxes, but the majority of the untraced items date back before the 1970s when they were stored more loosely in boxes and trunks. In some cases, framed paintings lie in vaults.“There are potentially thousands of abandoned safety deposit boxes in banks around the country,” said Joe Carey, chairman of the Oireachtas Committee for Rural and Community Development and Fine Gael TD for Clare.“We need to get background on what happens in other jurisdictions, but our anecdotal evidence is that there could be lots of items of historical and cultural relevance,” he told The .Today’s hearing by the Oireachtas committee, which has oversight of Ireland’s dormant accounts laws, will be the first to see if a way can be found to ensure that boxes are dealt with and papers of historical importance recovered.Mr Carey said: “In those parcels there could be anything: papers, documents, gold bullion, artworks, antiques, even weapons. These items have accumulated in vaults. The issue of ownership is a complex legal issue.“We don’t want to breach people’s right to property or to privacy. The new GDPR legislation brings with it a whole range of legal protections.”Former Bank of Ireland official Jim Connolly, who has had an interest for more than two decades in bank vault treasures, will detail the knowledge he has built up since the early 1990s.Banks historically agreed to store valued items in their vaults for more than two centuries. However, the ability to prise them open and dispose of their contents is curtailed by a lack of legal clarity. There are no regulations requiring banks to identify or contact beneficial owners.Such storage has become more formal since the early 1970s when safety-deposit boxes began to be introduced.Under the Dormant Accounts Act, financial institutions are obliged to identify accounts that have lain idle for 15 years, and the money is transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund if no claim is made.Owners of those accounts can still claim the money at any time, but this is not something that is easily achievable with physical property that might be taken from vaults, another complexity which is due to be analysed by the committee.The Oireachtas committee is expected to hear calls to allow banks to open sealed boxes and trunks, so that they may track down information that could be useful to find the descendants of those who originally made the deposits.Calling for action, Mr Carey raised questions about what may have happened to items stored in the vaults of bank branches that have been closed in recent decades. “Who knows what happened?” he asked."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3816238.1551871526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside ireland s socialist party telling the digestible truth","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul Murphy, left, said: “The guiding line for us all in this debate should be what Lenin, approvingly quoting Trotsky, argued, that ‘ideological struggle within the party does not mean mutual ostracism but mutual influence’.” Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe Socialist Party will present the truth “in the way which is most digestible to the working class at a particular time”, TD Paul Murphy has said.In internal documents discussing Brexit and wider strategy, he asks: “Are we guilty of not ‘telling the truth’ to the working class when we don’t bring a demand to leave the EU?“We always tell the truth to the working class. But we present the truth in the way which is most digestible to the working class at a particular time.”In exchanges with members including Joe Higgins, he advocates a “united front” method of dealing with groups such as Sinn Féin.Lenin“The guiding line for us all in this debate should be what Lenin, approvingly quoting Trotsky, argued, that ‘ideological struggle within the party does not mean mutual ostracism but mutual influence’.”He also corrects his comrades’ “inaccurate historical description of the united front as ‘tactics the Comintern and revolutionary parties adopted . . . in the 1920s and 1930s’.“It was in fact central to the success of the Bolsheviks in 1917, and was fought for by Lenin in particular,” he says, citing the “struggle proposed by the Bolsheviks to stop the Kornilov coup against the Kerensky government in August 1917, using ‘Kerensky as a gun-rest to shoot Kornilov’”.The inner workings of the Socialist Party are not usually on display for all to see.Its TDs - Paul Murphy, Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry - are the most cogent left-wing voices in the Dáil.Also operating under the Solidarity (formerly Anti-Austerity Alliance) banner, they have led debates on issues such as abortion and water charges.Documents recently circulated within the party, however, illustrate how their movement has been criticised by international comrades for an excessive focus on abortion and women’s rights issues.A collection of documents, including internal policy papers and international policy papers totalling 66 pages, have been seen by The , and also reveal serious differences between leading figures on domestic political strategy.Mr Murphy, Ms Coppinger and Mr Barry did not return repeated requests for comment on Tuesday.A number of party councillors also declined to comment, with one saying he had been asked not to speak to The . Former party TD Joe Higgins, also named in the documents, did not return calls.Parent organisation differencesThe documents show how differences emerged with the International Section (IS) of the Committee for a Workers International (CWI), the parent organisation of the Socialist Party.Concerns were raised with Irish members last autumn on “struggles relating to women’s oppression”.The differences, in fact, pre-date last year’s referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment.British activists felt the AAA was not forceful enough in arguing during the 2016 general election for “public ownership of the main sectors of the economy”.The sharpest exchanges, however, came over the importance of the abortion referendum.“It is our duty, as the elected leadership of the CWI, to raise our concerns in order to strengthen the work of the whole international,” the International Section of the CWI said in a paper called Women’s Oppression and Identity Politics - Our Approach in Ireland and Internationally.“We think the comrades could be in danger of overstating the importance of the victory on abortion rights. In our view a tendency has also developed of some leading Irish comrades seeing all struggles through the prism of the women’s movement, rather than seeing how it interconnects with other struggles.”It also questioned the future of the pro-choice group linked to the Socialist Party, Reproductive rights against Oppression, Sexism and Austerity (Rosa).For the IS, the campaign against water charges is held up as a better example of “how united working-class struggle can win, and crucially our role in leading it”.Role in IrelandHowever, the role taken by those in Ireland in leading campaigns to increase awareness around abortion pills in the years before the referendum is praised.“Clearly, the militant and campaigning stance taken by the comrades - for which they were attacked by a layer of bourgeois and petit-bourgeois feminists - was an important positive factor.”There is some criticism of Ms Coppinger for comments made at an “England and Wales Socialism 2014 event”. Ms Coppinger is noted as saying: “Most young women wouldn’t have seen unions doing much for women. I thought a lot of the contributions were from middle-age women and were economic.”The IS responded by saying the event in question “had a particular trade union focus that had not been the case in many other years”.“However, in our view Ruth’s comments also reveal a misunderstanding about the necessity of us explaining how economic and social change can be won, and the role of the organised working class in achieving that, as well as an underestimation of the importance of economic issues for working-class women, including young women.“This generation of petit-bourgeois feminists put very little focus on winning material gains for women concentrating overwhelmingly on iniduals’ experience of sexism. In that sense their ideas are a retreat from at least some of the feminist struggles of the 1970s.”The Irish National Executive Committee (NEC) sent its own document in response. “From the NEC in Ireland, with all NEC comrades, bar Paul M voting for the document,” it notes, and argues: “The IS document could give the impression that the Irish section is soft on, and friendly with the forces of petitbourgeois feminism.“The IS document says we are in danger of overstating the abortion rights victory. Unfortunately, the IS are understating it.”The response to the Belfast rape trial last year of rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding (who were both acquitted of rape charges) is also a flashpoint between the IS and Ireland.The Irish NEC says: “In the context of the Belfast rape trial and presumably in reaction to the ‘I believe her’ slogan that emerged from below, the IS document cautions, ‘we have to be careful not to go along with the conclusion of many petit-bourgeois feminists that every accusation of sexual assault made by a woman against a man has to be accepted. The IS are intimating that we just follow petit-bourgeois feminists. This is inaccurate to say the least. The facts are that when we called the demonstration North and South regarding this trial, we purposely called it under the general titleslogan of ‘Stand with Her \u0026amp All Survivors’.“The key point is that if we were overly legalistic or cautious in our approach, we would not have taken the initiatives and these important developments and potential would have passed us by.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3816346.1551879088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in spokeswoman like a donkey compared to her thoroughbred colleagues","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Fein’s Imelda Munster accused Shane Ross of being “incompetent” over controversial green card issue.

His comments followed a scathing attack by Ms Munster the party’s transport spokeswoman on the Minister over the controversial green card motorists crossing the border will be required to have as proof of insurance in the event of a no deal Brexit. Ms Munster traded insults with Mr Ross accusing him of being incompetent and unable to do his job, and said he was “completely blind to the sensitivities” felt by people crossing the border and who will be required to hold an “international certificate”.She initially made reference to the Minister’s absence from a transport committee because of pressures of work and thanked him for attending the Dáil given his work commitments. She added “I hope you didn’t have to miss your elevenses”.“Completely blind”The Louth TD also compared Mr Ross unfavourably to his colleague Ministers, who she said managed to resolve issues in their area “and you didn’t”.She told the Minister: “You made no attempt whatsover. You should have been pushing the EU to get the waiver” to ensure such a certificate was not needed “ and you’ve let everyone down Minister”.“It seems to me that you’re completely blind to the sensitivities around this issue.”Ms Munster added that she knew from a previous transport committee meeting that he did not know “even the basic bits” and had to be prompted for information,“You didn’t come in with the information that you didn’t have the inclination or care, or concern to look into it.“If other Minsters could resolve issues in their brief and you didn’t, that really says it all.”“Apple cart”But Mr Ross in turn rounded on Ms Munster and said that when the issue was raised during debate on the Brexit Omnibus Bill on Tuesday night her colleagues “were mature, sensitive and constructive”, and representing their communities.“They were like thoroughbreds in a horse race and you came in as you normally do and you’re like a donkey in the last race, at the last fence. You upset the whole apple cart.”Ms Munster retorted that the Minister “wants to be personal to mask his overall incompetence”.Leas Cheann Comhairle Pat ‘The Cope’ Gallagher called on Mr Ross to use parliamentary language."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3816082.1551853827!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to eu and uk to resolve green card for motorists t%C3%A1naiste says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit: People from the Bogside in Derry  not happy  that they need the card to cross over to Buncrana in Donegal. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyThe European Commission needs to directly resolve the issue of the “green card” requirement with the UK for motorists driving between Ireland and Northern Ireland, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said.Ireland could not sort the matter on its own, he insisted as opposition TDs from border counties highlighted the anger and confusion among motorists over a decision by the insurance industry to issue green cards to ensure motorists crossing the border were covered in a post-Brexit scenario.Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty criticised the Government and said this should have been dealt with when the common travel area was being considered.Mr Coveney insisted however that the Government and the Minister for Transport could not have resolved this problem because it is an EU issue.The EU has contingency plans in place with Britain on aviation and other areas of transport but not yet for this, he said during the ongoing debate on the Brexit Omnibus Bill to ensure the status quo prevails in key strategic areas including health, transport and finance, in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU.Mr Doherty said the website of the British body with responsibility in this area stated that motorists in Britain they did not need a green card for any EU jurisdiction and it was only for outside the EU, and he questioned why it was needed in Ireland.People from the Bogside in Derry were not happy to be told that they need the card to cross over to Buncrana in Donegal, he added.A lot of people are “very angry that they have to have an international insurance certificate to cross the Lifford bridge” that they have crossed every day of their lives.Own rulesThe Donegal TD said his own insurance company emailed all their policy holders and told everyone to apply a month in advance. Mr Doherty said he phoned a month in advance and was told to phone again in two weeks when they would know better.He was concerned that a motorist’s car could be impounded.Fine Gael Louth TD Fergus O’Dowd said it seemed “every insurance company is following its own rules and there is no united front on it”.He said the EU and British government could reach a consensus on this but “the whole thing is an appalling mess”.Sinn Féin transport spokeswoman Imelda Munster, a Louth TD sharply criticised Minister for Transport Shane Ross who at a recent transport committee meeting “literally knew damn all or had damn all information” on the issue.And she said “he made no effort to seek a dispensation. That is shocking. It’s contributed to and created the confusion and uncertainty that people now feel.”But the Tánaiste said that cars driven from Ireland to Northern Ireland were covered under the EU motor insurance directive but if the UK leaves the EU without a plan the directive would not apply.He said the insurance industry in its contingency planning decided to issue a green card, which he described as “slightly unfortunately named” as proof of insurance cover for drivers going north.But he said it was not a question of drivers being stopped at the border.Earlier TDs accepted a “precautionary amendment” introduced by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to allow for no duty free between Ireland and the UK if the British government publicly commits to such an arrangement.The UK had indicated it would not introduce duty free between Ireland and the UK.Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath said that airports and ports in Ireland had expressed concern that they would be at a disadvantage if other EU countries introduced duty free and Mr Doherty asked about cross border shopping and the consideration given by the EU to the matter.The Minister said the EU had given little consideration to this as it did not affect other EU countries to the extent that did between Ireland and the UK because of the passenger volumes between the two countries.He also pointed out that under World Customs Organisation rules which the UK as well as the rest of the EU had membership of, said that duty free should only be available at ports and airports and not at land borders, so he did not anticipate much consequence from cross border shopping.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The family’s request to have the tomb reopened “will be studied”, he said.The existence of the tip-off, and the family’s request to the Vatican, came as Pope Francis announced that he will open up archives relating to the controversial wartime papacy of Pius XII, who has been accused of failing to speak out against the persecution of the Jews and Hitler’s Final Solution.“Seeing as the Pope has decided to open the Vatican archives for the pontificate of Pius XII in 2020, we make an appeal to the pontiff to give us access to the dossier that regards the investigation into the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi,” said Ms Sgrò, the family’s lawyer. “Francis must clarify this deeply shadowy story as well.”The teenager was the daughter of a Vatican employee and lived inside the city state, the world’s smallest sovereign nation. She was also a Vatican citizen.The Vatican is under pressure to open the tomb in the Teutonic Cemetery There have been multiple theories as to what happened to her. It has been suggested that she was kidnapped to force the release from jail of Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk who tried to assassinate Pope Jean Paul II in 1981.It has also been suggested that she was taken by an organised crime group in an attempt to recover a loan made to the Vatican.Her family have campaigned tirelessly to find out the truth about what happened to her.Hopes were raised in October when workmen stumbled on human remains beneath the foundations of the Vatican’s embassy to Italy in Rome.But tests later proved that the skeleton was not that of a teenage girl.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Vatican City and Holy SeePlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Geoffrey Cox fails to make backstop breakthrough after \u0026#39robust\u0026#39 talks in BrusselsAsh Wednesday and Lent 2019: What to give up, and the meaning behind the datesCountdown to Brexit: \u0026#39Nervous and unprepared\u0026#39 - the view from our readers abroad Stray mongrel beats pedigrees to become elite Indian sniffer dogThai opposition leader vows to \u0026#39democratise\u0026#39 country as his party faces ban for fielding princess in electionsUniversity of Glasgow and RBS headquarters evacuated after suspicious packages found in mailroomComment: Theresa May will soon have to decide if she is serious that \u0026#39no deal is better than a bad deal\u0026#39Watch Japan\u0026#39s space probe grab a piece of the moonImmigration no longer public\u0026#39s top concern, ONS study finds, as health becomes number one priorityMost diabetics who lose a stone and a half can reverse the condition, landmark study suggestsChina creates bizarre rap video in propaganda push for rubber-stamp parliamentVirgin flight for cruise ship passengers quarantined at Gatwick Comment: The British defeated the EU - you should be demanding surrender terms, not offering themComment: Vaccines are a critical weapon in the fight against superbugsPolice plan surge in officers to combat knife crime after Sajid Javid hints at extra cash for \u0026#39national emergency\u0026#39London bombs: Britain\u0026#39s transport hubs told to \u0026#39be vigilant\u0026#39 as police probe \u0026#39Irish dissident plot\u0026#39 Ex-Nissan head Carlos Ghosn released from detention after three months in custody in JapanGame of Thrones season 8 trailer: watch Arya face death and dragons in the final teaserKit Harington says Game of Thrones \u0026#39screwed the political landscape\u0026#39Satellite images show North Korea rebuilding rocket launch site it had pledged to dismantleComment: Parents and radio are two things always worth listening toWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000123416208_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVV3O4fliYhybKGByz6q2IDyQYbXR70-6O2GfxRHSQHE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"diabetics lose stone half can reverse condition landmark study","story":"A national trial forms part of a long term plan for the NHS Type two diabetes can be put in remission for at least two years following a three-month diet of soups and shakes, a landmark study has found. The condition was reversed in two thirds of diabetics who lost at least a stone and a half. Researchers said the findings were “incredibly exciting” and could mean the end of type two diabetes as a lifelong condition.Previous studies have found that in the short-term, the disease can be reversed, by sticking to a very low-calorie diet.The new study tracked participants long after the diet finished - and found that two thirds of those who lost at least 22 lbs remained in remission after two years.Scientists believe the strict diet is particularly effective at shifting fat surrounding the pancreas, helping the recovery of its function producing insulin.However, they warned that keeping the weight off was crucial to keeping diabetes at bay.Overall, just over one third of those who tried the regime were free of the disease, 24 months after they began the diet.Researchers from Newcastle and Glasgow Universities have been testing the diet of around 800 calories a day on almost 300 patients with diabetes.Health officials are so excited by early findings from the trials that around 5,000 NHS patients are now being recruited for a national study.The new findings, published in The Lancet Diabetes \u0026amp Endocrinology, show that after one year, 46 per cent of those put on the diet were in remission. Twelve months later, 70 per cent of these cases remained remained in remission.And one quarter of those on the regime of soup and shakes had lost at least a stone and a half, the figures show.The patients - aged between 20 and 65, had struggled with their condition for up to six years, using drugs to control their blood sugar levels.Two years later, 36 per cent of those who had been on the diet remained in remission. The best results were seen among those who lost the most weight.In total, 64 per cent of those who lost at least 22 lbs remained in remission after two years.The study found that participants regained some weight, as expected, between the first and second year.However, those who stayed in remission had a greater average weight loss - of around 34 lbs - compared with those who did not, whose average loss was 26 lbs.By the end of the trial just 40 per cent of the dieters were on diabetes medication, compared with 75 per cent at the start.At a glance | What to avoid when exercising with Type 1 diabetesThe results of the DiRECT trial, funded by Diabetes UK were announced today at Diabetes UK’s Professional Conference in Liverpool.Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University, said: “These results are a significant development, and finally pull down the curtain on the era of Type 2 diabetes as an inevitably progressive disease.“We now understand the biological nature of this reversible condition. However, everyone in remission needs to know that evidence to date tells us that your Type 2 diabetes will return if you regain weight.”“People with Type 2 diabetes and healthcare professionals have told us their top research priority is ‘can the condition be reversed or cured’. We can now say, with respect to reversal, that yes it can. Now we must focus on helping people maintain their weight loss and stay in remission for life.”Dr Elizabeth Robertson, director of Research at Diabetes UK, said: “These results further challenge the perception that Type 2 diabetes needs to be a lifelong condition for everyone diagnosed with it.“Remission of Type 2 diabetes can be life changing DiRECT offers one potential solution, we are committed to working with the researchers and the NHS to ensure these exciting findings reach people with Type 2 diabetes as soon as possible.”Participants were defined as in remission if they had long-term blood glucose levels (HbA1c) of less than 48mmolmol without needing to use any Type 2 diabetes medications.The average HbA1c fell from 60mmolmol at the start to 54mmolmol at the end of year two.In comparison, the average HbA1c remained similar (58mmolmol vs 59mmolmol) in those receiving standard care – the control group – while the proportion of people taking medications increased from 77 per cent to 84 per cent.Diabetes: everything you need to know, including the causes, signs, symptoms and treatmentsThe lives changed by lifestyle overhauls 58 year-old Joe McSorley from Glasgow, didn’t have any symptoms before being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.His diagnosis came as a huge shock, and the thought of being on medication for life led him to take part in the trial.Since achieving remission by making lifestyle changes, the BT engineer has made plans to become a personal trainer – which he’ll do when he retires in two years’ time.Now Joe does not need to take any of his diabetes medications.He said: “It’s been a life-changing experience for me in many ways. One of the biggest changes has been the exercise which I now do on a daily basis without thinking about it twice. I’d have never imagined that I would be as fit at my age as I was at 21 or that my blood pressure would ever be similar to that of an athlete.“It was a difficult decision to take but it was the right decision as my life has changed so much. The way I used to look at diabetes was starting to have a detrimental effect on my life – looking back, there was a certain amount of denial when I got on the trial. DiRECT gave me the direction I was lacking and pushed me to make the changes that I was due making in my life.”Six months after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2011, Isobel Murray, 67 from North Ayrshire, was put on medication.This was increased with each visit to the doctor, due to her feeling more and more unwell.This all changed in 2014 when, 17 weeks into the trial, Isobel went into remission.Four and a half years later, Isobel is still in remission and does not need any diabetes medication.She said: “When I was first told that my diabetes went into remission, I felt absolutely ecstatic. Four and a half years later, that feeling is still with me. Over the last few years I’ve been able to lead a normal life again.“It only took a few months to do the plan and to get my life back – it was worth every minute. I feel ten years younger now and I will do everything in my power to never go back to how things were before I still keep a food diary from time to time to make sure I stay on track, along with going to the gym and doing a lot more walking.”What is the liquid diet?Liquid diets - also known as Total Diet Replacement - involve abandoning all normal foods, and instead existing on a regime of powdered soups and shakes.Dieters are allowed four small meals a day, each providing around 200 calories, with a mixture of sweet and savoury flavours on offer.The key is keeping the total daily calorie intake low - at less than 850 calories a day.Some obesity experts believe that the packet meals are helpful in maintaining discipline, suggesting that those with a history of failed dieting can find it easier to stick to such limits when they cut out the temptations of normal foods.Two in three adults are overweight or obese.Experts said many cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed by healthy eating, being more active, and losing weight if overweight.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Millions of Type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented if we help people understand their risk and how to reduce it. Even though the older people get the more likely they are to have Type 2 diabetes, it is never too early to know your risk so that you can make changes to prevent or delay it.”The charity is urging those aged 40 or over to have a free NHS health check offered by GPs.It also said their own Know Your Risk online tool could help people to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Brexit latest news: Geoffrey Cox fails to make backstop breakthrough after \u0026#39robust\u0026#39 talks in BrusselsAsh Wednesday and Lent 2019: What to give up, and the meaning behind the datesCountdown to Brexit: \u0026#39Nervous and unprepared\u0026#39 -

In its latest economic outlook, the OECD said growth is expected to remain weak in the UK for the foreseeable future. Based on a smooth Brexit and a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, the OECD has forecast GDP growth of below 1 per cent in the next two years. However, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by around 2 per cent in the UK for the next two years. The OECD said: “The effects could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to EU trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross-border supply chains.”The group said the costs associated with a cliff-edge departure from the EU could be magnified by a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruption in financial markets.

Meanwhile, the think tank said the impact of trade arrangements on WTO terms would vary across the EU, with smaller countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark “relatively exposed”. The biggest impact would be felt in the agriculture, machinery and equipment sectors. The OECD’s predictions echo previous warnings from the Bank of England, which last year said a no deal could plunge the UK into a larger recession that the global financial crisis 10 years ago if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. Based on the bank’s worst case scenario modelling, the UK economy would contract by 8 per cent, house prices would fall by a third, unemployment would spike to 7.5 per cent, interest rates would shoot up to 5.5 per cent and the value of the pound would fall to below $1.We’ll tell you what’s true.

What will these votes mean for the UK economy, jobs and wages?\u0026nbspFirst, on the brink of Brexit, where does the UK economy stand?\u0026nbsp The Brexit vote has hit growth. There is a strong consensus that, to date, the UK economy is perhaps 1 to 2 per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been (and, correspondingly, real household incomes are 1 to 2 per cent\u0026nbsplower).\u0026nbspThat was mostly down to the impact of the fall in the pound in the immediate aftermath of the referendum.More recently, growth in the final quarter of 2018 was 0.2 per cent – weak, but not disastrous. But the most up-to-date data is considerably worse looking at the monthly data, there’s been essentially no growth since the summer. Part of this reflects global economic developments – the eurozone economy is also weak.Created with Sketch.

I fear elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents. I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.But there are obvious Brexit effects as well, in particular the slowdown in business investment and a record rise in “stockpiling”, as factories try desperately to ensure that they won’t run short of vital components if trade is disrupted by a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit. \u0026nbspIf no deal actually materialises, it seems likely we’d see a further significant fall in sterling, pushing up import prices and inflation, and reducing real wages.\u0026nbspConsiderably more worrying, however, would be the impacts on consumer and business confidence, and hence spending. Businesses would be hit by rising input prices, resulting both from the fall in sterling and the need to replace EU imports with more expensive ones sourced from outside the EU.Consumers would face rising inflation at a time when they will be trying to reduce discretionary spending, and with little prospect of large pay rises. Any actual disruption to business activities, through the disruption of supply chains or cutting off access to EU export markets, would come on top of this – and could be very severe indeed.To some extent, these could and would be mitigated by policy actions from the UK government. The Bank of England would be likely to (indeed already has) raise interest rates more slowly than it otherwise would have done. And although the deficit will widen if the economy slows, the government will - very sensibly – respond to that as Gordon Brown did in 2008 by spending more, not less. The government has learned from George Osborne’s mistakes.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could push UK into recession, think tank warnsWould all this mean a recession?\u0026nbsp I’d be very surprised if it doesn’t – and indeed I’ve put my money where my mouth is, but it will of course depend crucially on political developments.If the UK and the EU keep talking and try to minimise the damage, we might get away with a relatively limited downturn. If things spiral out of control with tit-for-tat measures, then it could be very grim indeed.Over the longer term, it will be the future trading arrangements between the UK and the EU27 (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world) that determines the long-term economic impacts of Brexit.\u0026nbspUnder no deal, the UK and the EU would revert to trading under rules governed by World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, although the default assumption must be that when the dust settles, various bilateral agreements to facilitate trade within the WTO framework would likely be agreed.\u0026nbspCredible estimates of the long-run impact of this on the UK economy suggest that it would reduce output by up to 10 per cent. And – unlike the inherently unpredictable short-term consequences of a ‘chaotic Brexit’ – these can be modelled quantitatively using standard economic models.The government’s own estimates are that this would reduce GDP and wages by 8-10 per cent\u0026nbspover the next 15 years.\u0026nbspOf course, whatever happens with Brexit, many other factors – including UK domestic economic policy – will drive economic growth between 2018 and 2033.The expectation is still that the UK economy will continue to grow. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that a ‘hard’ Brexit would prove a significant drag on growth over the medium to long term.What about if the deal is passed? Business will undoubtedly breath a sigh of relief as the immediate threat of no deal is lifted. But while the government claims that the deal offers business certainty, that is only true only in the short-term, and only by comparison to the chaos of no deal. A transition period will guarantee the status quo until at least the end of 2020, but we still know little about what happens after that.\u0026nbspThe deal sets out a broad framework – the “Political Declaration” for the future relationship between the UK and the EU – but only a framework, which is not binding on either side. And given that political instability both in the UK and continental Europe seems far more likely than not, it is unclear how much it will constrain negotiations.\u0026nbsp What is certain is that just as in the Article 50 negotiations, the UK will have by far the weaker hand, and will need to make big concessions on issues from fish to financial services. \u0026nbspSterling would rise and confidence would recover to more normal levels, but the long-term question marks over the UK economy and its access to European markets would remain. For these reasons forecasts of a “Brexit boom” after a deal seem misplaced it’s more likely to be a “dead cat bounce.”\u0026nbsp Particularly given that – for reasons that have nothing to do with Brexit – world trade growth is already slowing, UK growth seems likely to remain fairly disappointing this year.What about the long-term impacts of May’s deal?\u0026nbsp Assuming that the future relationship is indeed based on the customs backstop written into the Withdrawal Agreement, then there will be no tariffs on UK-EU trade, no customs checks at the border and no need for firms to satisfy rules of origin requirements.\u0026nbsp All good news, especially for manufacturing. However, for the UK’s dominant service\u0026nbsp sector – 80 per cent\u0026nbspof the economy, nearly half of exports to the EU, and almost certainly the main driver of future export growth – the news is much worse.\u0026nbspLeaving the Single Market will mean substantial new barriers to UK companies, and there is little or nothing in the Political Declaration to suggest we will get much in the way of special treatment.\u0026nbspAnd we are not just talking about the City and financial services here, but a whole range of sectors from broadcasting to transport.\u0026nbsp Indeed, while UK manufactures are furious with the government’s handling of the negotiations, most economists find it even more baffling that the UK government has essentially done nothing to protect the interest of some of the most dynamic and successful sectors of the UK economy.Nor are trade deals with non-EU countries likely to make up the difference.\u0026nbsp Recent days have shown how large the obstacles will be to any UK-US trade deal, which would inevitably involve major concessions by the UK in politically difficult areas – not just chlorinated chicken.\u0026nbspIndeed, the UK is likely to be in a considerably weaker position in negotiating such deals than it would be within the EU.\u0026nbspSo the overall impact of May’s deal, while considerably smaller than no deal, will still be negative – the government’s estimates, which may be optimistic, are of a hit to GDP of 2 to 4 per cent our own estimates are 2 per cent\u0026nbspto 5.5 per cent. And if Theresa May is replaced by a more hard-line Brexiteer who seeks to negotiate his or her way out of the backstop, and hence a customs union, the prognosis will be considerably worse – much closer to the no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspWhat this means is that while no deal is clearly worse for the economy than the deal on the table, and comes with further unpredictable downsides, there are big negatives to Theresa May’s deal both continued uncertainty for the next couple of years and the likelihood of a very damaging outcome for important parts of the UK economy, leading to a significant drag on growth for the medium term.And finally, what if we “kick the can” and seek an extension of the Article 50 process? In the short term, this is the outcome which maximises uncertainty, since nothing will be resolved.\u0026nbspMost businesses would nevertheless prefer it to the certain downsides of No Deal but it clearly is not a solution.During the period of extension, businesses would still have to plan for the possibility of No Deal, even while hoping for something better. If – and this is of course a big if – it led to a “softer” Brexit, which at least left open the possibility of continued customs union and Single Market membership (including freedom of movement) then the long-term economic downsides of Brexit would largely vanish.\u0026nbspBut it if simply leads to a delayed No Deal, or a slightly tweaked version of the same deal, then it’s hard to see what we would gain.So our MPs are in a bind.\u0026nbspThere is no option that will resolve the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the UK economy any time soon, and none which can credibly claim to avert the risk of substantial long-term damage.\u0026nbspThe chancellor famously claimed that “no-one voted to be poorer.” Maybe, maybe not. But next week most of our elected representatives will almost certainly – one way or the other – do just that.\u0026nbspJonathan Portes is a senior fellow at academic think tank The UK in a Changing Europe and professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London.​We’ll tell you what’s true.

But it is.\u0026nbspThe Access to Cash Review\u0026nbspwas put together by an independent panel of financial experts with the work funded by, but independent of, Link, which operates the UK’s network of cash machines.It’s authoritative, raises some important points, and also (crucially) floats some ideas for tackling them.\u0026nbspUK’s cash system in danger of ‘collapse’, leaving millions strugglingOne in five Brits have a ‘side hustle’ to make extra cash, says studyUK companies hoarding cash ahead of Brexit, new data showsThe reason why it’s a Brexit issue is this: will any of those points get the attention they deserve paid to them by a crisis-wracked government focused on just that one thing?\u0026nbspThe rapid decline in the use of cash ought to be an issue for the Treasury, which should be well aware of it. The issue has also been raised by the Payment Systems Regulator (repeatedly)\u0026nbspthe Financial Conduct Authority, which considered access to bank branches and ATMs in its Financial Lives of Consumers last year\u0026nbspand a variety of other organisations.\u0026nbspSome of the brighter sparks in the civil service congregate around Number 11 Downing Street, and they will doubtless be cognisant of the fact that the inability to use cash will pose a serious a problem for some groups the poor, the elderly, those living in rural areas where broadband connections are lousy, hampering the use of recent technological innovations.\u0026nbspThe problem is that the crisis is a looming one. There is still time before it becomes full blown. Given that the government’s time horizon currently doesn’t extend much beyond getting through the day without yet another disaster of its own making crashing down on its, and our, heads, it will likely feel that this is one of the many issues that can wait.\u0026nbspNo one has the faintest idea what’s happening with Brexit, businesses are screaming, and the economy is wilting. That’s before one considers the impact of a no-deal cliff edge and the fact that it could still happen, either by accident or the design of the extremists or the allies of extremists whom Chancellor Philip Hammond sits around the cabinet table with.\u0026nbspThat’s what the Treasury is focused upon, and it doesn’t have much choice.\u0026nbspEverything else is on the back burner.\u0026nbspSo you can forget consideration of the\u0026nbspreport’s\u0026nbspsuggested solutions\u0026nbsprequiring that essential services provided by utilities and councils allow for cash payments, having the banks create a body that would step in if rural communities run short, among other things. Ditto the idea\u0026nbspof creating a watchdog to safeguard cash, suggested by pressure group Positive Money.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Trouble is he doesn’t want the job.\u0026nbspThe company delivered a 44 per cent rise in sales in 2018, while pre tax profits came in at £102m against a £76m loss last time. Its preferred measure for earnings (underlying EBITDA) showed a rather more modest improvement of 6 per cent to £174m. But that was still more than handy given that this is a fast growing business facing considerable competitive pressure, notably from the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats, that’s investing heavily in what it does.\u0026nbspDuffy has also been credited with an improvement in margins, despite that competition, and while the shares fell today, they’ve been run up strongly over the past few weeks, so don\u0027t read too much into that.\u0026nbspJust Eat pledges to remove all restaurants with zero hygiene ratingRestaurants on Just Eat giving ‘life-threatening allergen information’The company’s acting boss is even confident that he can make money from offering a delivery service. As well as matching customers to takeaways, which handle their own deliveries, Just Eat wants to grab a bigger slice of that marketplace.\u0026nbspAs such, it’s muscling in on its rivals’ territory, working with branded restaurants to deliver food.\u0026nbspMaking money from doing that is not easy. But Duffy reckons the company can do it all the same, promising profits from Canada this year, and Australia and the UK further down the line.\u0026nbspThat’d be quite the trick.\u0026nbspDespite its achievements, however, the company finds itself in the cross hairs\u0026nbspof a US activist investor, in the form of Cat Rock. It thinks Just Eat should pursue a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway (in which Cat also holds shares) and give control of the combined business to the latter’s CEO Jitse Groen. Who\u0027s not much keen on the idea.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspActivists would be a good thing if they addressed corporate governance issues, silly pay packages for executives, and the like and sometimes they can have a positive impact on under performing businesses with bad bosses and boards.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

In its latest economic outlook, the OECD said growth is expected to remain weak in the UK for the foreseeable future. Based on a smooth Brexit and a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, the OECD has forecast GDP growth of below 1 per cent in the next two years. However, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by around 2 per cent in the UK for the next two years. The OECD said: “The effects could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to EU trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross-border supply chains.”The group said the costs associated with a cliff-edge departure from the EU could be magnified by a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruption in financial markets.

Meanwhile, the think tank said the impact of trade arrangements on WTO terms would vary across the EU, with smaller countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark “relatively exposed”. The biggest impact would be felt in the agriculture, machinery and equipment sectors. The OECD’s predictions echo previous warnings from the Bank of England, which last year said a no deal could plunge the UK into a larger recession that the global financial crisis 10 years ago if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. Based on the bank’s worst case scenario modelling, the UK economy would contract by 8 per cent, house prices would fall by a third, unemployment would spike to 7.5 per cent, interest rates would shoot up to 5.5 per cent and the value of the pound would fall to below $1.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The bookmaker said the name change would reflect “the increased ersity of our brands and operations”, but chief executive Peter Jackson said: “There are no plans to use this historical name for consumers.” Meanwhile, revenue was up 9 per cent, from £1.75bn to £1.87bn, while pre-tax profit dropped 11 per cent from £247m to £219m. The group said earnings were lower due to investments made in the US, and the idend was unchanged.

This gives our growing customer base access to the greatest choice of restaurants and drives even more orders to our restaurant partners, ultimately strengthening the network effects of our business.”Created with Sketch.Garçon Wines: Wine delivery that fits through your letterbox Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.However, Just Eat is under intense pressure from shareholder Cat Rock, which has ripped into the company over recent board appointments and has ordered it to seek a merger with a “well-run industry peer”.The group, which owns 2 per cent\u0026nbspof Just Eat, has said this would be a better outcome than relying on the board to choose a new chief executive following the departure of Peter Plumb last month.Just Eat is attempting to keep up with Deliveroo and Uber, which have been muscling in on its territory.Speculation that Uber is in early talks to buy Deliveroo has also recently hit Just Eat\u0027s shares.Shares were down around 1 per cent\u0026nbspon Wednesday morning at 774p.bby\u0027Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “You can tell Just Eat is a company under pressure from an activist investor judging by the language used in its full-year results.“It\u0027s like you are reading a marketing textbook on the buzz words used to make your company sound good.“Investors aren\u0027t fooled looking at how the share price has fallen on publication of the results.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The bookmaker said the name change would reflect “the increased ersity of our brands and operations”, but chief executive Peter Jackson said: “There are no plans to use this historical name for consumers.” Meanwhile, revenue was up 9 per cent, from £1.75bn to £1.87bn, while pre-tax profit dropped 11 per cent from £247m to £219m. The group said earnings were lower due to investments made in the US, and the idend was unchanged.

And it seems to suggest there is something equally strange about the poles on the planets, which appear to be tilted off centre.The discovery could change our understanding of exoplanets and their\u0026nbspstructure, climate, and habitability as we look around the universe for more places like our own Earth, the researchers say.As it scanned the universe, Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspKepler mission found about 30 per cent of stars similar to our own have super-Earths.

The fact they are tipped over also seems to push them further apart, researchers\u0026nbspYale astronomers Sarah Millholland and Gregory Laughlin\u0026nbspsaid.More than 100 new exoplanets found“When planets such as these have large axial tilts, as opposed to little or no tilt, their tides are exceedingly more efficient at draining orbital energy into heat in the planets,” said first author\u0026nbspMillholland, a graduate student at Yale. “This vigorous tidal dissipation pries the orbits apart.”Earth and its moon are in a similar formation. The moon\u0027s orbit is slowly growing, but Earth\u0027s day is gradually lengthening, as the two go apart.The tilting seems to decide a whole range of features about the planets.“It impacts several of their physical features, such as their climate, weather, and global circulations,”\u0026nbspLaughlin\u0026nbspsaid. “The seasons on a planet with a large axial tilt are much more extreme than those on a well-aligned planet, and their weather patterns are probably non-trivial.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whether or not it takes off, it is seizing on technology that has never been seen before in a phone – features like bendy screens and special hinges that have hardly been seen in consumer products at all.But if that innovation was ever going to make sense, the software underpinning it had to be just as innovative – and perhaps more smart.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThat has involved creating entirely new features – not just software tweaks, but entire new kinds of infrastructure to power the complex system of two display.For example, we have a feature we call app continuity, says Chung. It means that you can just open the screen which works as a full-fledged display.Huawei releases a foldable phone as companies rush to make their handsIf you want to go big screen you can just open it, and the app you\u0027re running on the front cover continues to work in a bigger screen, he says. So it\u0027s a very seamless transition from closed to open form factor.That is the same version of the app: whatever you\u0027re doing on the small screen will still be happening on the big screen, just now in an expanded form.If that\u0027s not enough, however, the large inside screen is flexible in more ways than one. The bigger display will allow you to open up to three applications at the same time.Say you are doing some gaming – so you have your gaming app in our main screen, and at the same time you want to chat with your buddies while playing the game. The Fold\u0027s display can support all that – plus another, if you want, such as a YouTube stream or some music.Even if the phone can handle that much multitasking, many of its users won\u0027t. But Chung points out that there are plenty of more productive uses, too: you might want to have your email open in one display, messages in another and music in the third for instance, and people can do all of that in a very smooth way.All of that happens on a screen that is much more square than you might expect – at first glance, it looks square, though Chung explains that it is actually four to three, in line with a traditional PC display. That allows for plenty of space for multitasking and documents, he notes, though it will also support videos in whatever aspect ratio it wants.The first question that anyone tends to ask when confronted with a foldable phone is: why? The second one is often: why now?But Chung explains that it is not quite as immediate as it might appear. The foldable phone has been in the works almost since the beginning of the modern smartphone era, ushered in with the Galaxy S series and the iPhone.We have been doing this research for around eight years: it didn\u0027t happen overnight, he says. We saw the need for this kind of form factor, but then there are a lot of technical challenges.So we have been solving those challenges one by one, he says, noting that as well as the more obvious hardware questions posed by a foldable phone, there are plenty of software ones too.We really wanted to bring our very nice software experience, he says. We worked very closely with Google on that because we didn\u0027t want to create a proprietary solution only for Samsung devices.That meant digging down into the guts of Android, ensuring that features like app continuity and three multitasking windows that all work together could be supported by an operating system that was built for simple smartphones, not bendy modern mobiles.S10 smartphone (MobiFlip)It was important to make sure that foundation in place because it would be disastrous if developers came to the phone and found that the new environment – two screens, one bendy – broke whatever app you had worked so hard on, and which users wanted. So we really worked closely with Google so maintained a framework of support to keep your app still running, he says – as an app developer you don\u0027t have to worry that you are running on a Fold.As well as the developers of the infrastructure with Google, Samsung also says it worked hard with the developers who build on that infrastructure: companies like Facebook and Instagram, who will be creating the tools for this new device. We know this is not a one player game, says Chung, noting that it was important to address the entire ecosystem of content providers and app developers.All of that can sound painfully complex: it can be difficult enough to keep up with how a one-display phone works, in an era of constant software updates and alterations, let alone one with two displays and a whole array of displays. But Chung insists that the foundations and basics of the phone will be familiar, even if its form is very strange.The front screen is just like any regular Android phone, he notes – and then opening up the phone means doing that same thing, but now bigger.You don\u0027t have to do anything special as a user: you just open it, and then we will make sure that the same app will continue on the main screen, with more space.Once you\u0027re in that big screen, the phone can be used as a tablet, or with a few simple gestures the multitasking and other features can be introduced. That should avoid the fear of a big learning curve and added complexity as you try and use the phone, he says.Behind the scenes, of course, more complex processes are going on. But it is based on largely the same principles: you are running an app on the phone\u0027s small screen, and then when the display is opened it will detect that event, telling the phone to switch displays and show the app in its big screen mode. It is genuinely the same app, meaning that you should be exactly where you were when you were using it in small screen mode.Everything happens behind the scenes, he says, meaning as a user you don\u0027t have to worry about that. Switching should be pretty instant, and there should be no kind of interruption as you do so, since everything has been built to work together.Now that the phone is on its way out to the public, Chung suggests that its future will largely be decided by the people using it. The Fold has been built to allow it to embrace the various ways people are going to use it – ways that Samsung is aware it might not yet have thought of.All of that work done with Google and other content providers and developers should make it easier to build apps that take advantage of the extra space, he says.All the same, Samsung doesn\u0027t want to burden the developer, by forcing them to create two versions of every piece of software.\u0026nbsp Instead, the system should do all the work for the developers, allowing them not to worry about it. They can just focus on developing the application – which will then be able to pop out or not, depending on where it and its user are.MobiFlip)That is a philosophical as well as a technical commitment: the point of the changing apps is that, when they\u0027re opened up on the folding screen, they\u0027re just the same app but bigger. Even today, when having two displays means having two different devices, apps are largely thought of as continuous, and an app on a tablet is an extension of the one on the phone. The same principle applies to the Fold, says Chung, with apps not showing in two different versions so much as in two different sizes.Chung is speaking during MWC in Barcelona, where the entire phone industry descends for a week in March to announce their latest phones while we talk, people are elsewhere admiring folding phones from other companies like Huawei. A year ago, bendy handsets seemed impossible, but now they\u0027re impossible to avoid.He says this sudden flourishing is helpful for Samsung and everyone else involved in the market, since the more companies showing them off the better acquainted people will be with them.The same thing happened with big phones – then known as phablets – that were pioneered with devices like the Note.Just like with the foldable phones, those handsets were beset by doubt. Initial versions of those phones had problems with their screens, and questions over how exactly they would be used nobody really knew what they were, whether they were a phone or a tablet, and it eventually became clear the answer was actually sort of both. There were fears they would cannibalise each other, as the phablet made both a phone and a tablet redundant.Now the same questions are now being raised over the Fold. Chung hopes the answers will be the same, too – that the phones will find their own place in the market and create something new, not kill something old.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet we know that dinosaurs roamed all across North America, from Alaska to New Jersey and down to Mexico.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Activists on both the left and the right have accused the site of hosting extremists, and having either too strict or too weak policies on banning users from the site.Now he has taken to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast for an interview with the comedian, during which he suggested the company could be more lenient with such bans in the future.The interview with Joe Rogan followed a previous discussion on the podcast, in early February, when Jack Dorsey appeared on his own. Various right-wing activists such as conspiracy theorist and friend of Rogan, Alex Jones, said the interview had been too easy on the Twitter boss and that he should have been asked about growing controversies around who is being banned from the site.This time around, Jack Dorsey\u0026nbspappeared with Twitter\u0027s most senior legal officer and was asked a series of questions about why and how it was deciding to ban people from the site.The discussion largely centred around a recent phenomenon that saw numerous people tweet the phrase learn to code at journalists who had recently been made redundant. Many of those tweeting it claimed it was simply a meme – but it was linked with death threats and harassment and led to many people that posted the words being banned from the site.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

It found there were thousands and thousands of tweets being directed at a small number of journalists – and that many of those sending them were accounts that had been created to evade a ban.The push to ban Nazis on Twitter can just as easily affect the leftTwitter\u0027s chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde\u0026nbspwent on to explain more of the conclusions of that research, and how the phrase appeared to be part of what the company calls a pile-on, during which a vast volume of tweets are sending to one person. She defended the fact that many of the people posting those tweets had been kicked off Twitter, because many of them were being used alongside harassment and threats.But Mr Dorsey then said that the bans may have been a mistake. The bans were probably the consequence of our team having a lack of context into what\u0027s happening as well, he said, and went on to say that Twitter would fully admit we were probably way too aggressive when we first saw this, as well.Ms Gadde\u0026nbspthen said the company had a lot more work to do to explain its decisions, and to look into any mistakes it had made when it was suspending particular people.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What happens a lot in London, as deputies will be aware, is internal negotiations.”The prime minister herself is expected to visit Brussels this weekend in a bid to turn the tide of talks.Earlier in the week Mr Varadkar, who has the support of the EU,\u0026nbspeffectively ruled out the two main asks by the UK for an exit clause or time-limit.“The backstop is a means to an end but it\u0027s a really important end and that is a legally binding assurance that there won\u0027t be a hard border on our island, he told reporters.“We need to know that that will apply and that it won\u0027t be time-limited and that there won\u0027t be a unilateral exit from it.”The lack of progress appears to bode poorly for the Government’s chances of convincing Tory MPs to back the deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

If they are ministers they would be expected to resign, or get sacked.Free\u0026nbspvotes are usually reserved for well-established issues of conscience – notably matters such as abortion, capital punishment, fox hunting – and for relatively minor bits of uncontentious legislation, including, sometimes, private members’ bills.Occasionally they can be used as a way of pressuring the opposition parties to also offer a free vote – assuming the margin of advantage in such tactics lies with the government. (The opposite is also true).Created with Sketch.

Yet that is precisely what is being openly discussed, most recently by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.Labour to order MPs to vote for second Brexit referendum amendmentIn the crucial vote on a no-deal Brexit expected next week, Theresa May and (most of)\u0026nbspher cabinet are desperate to keep the option on the table. That does not necessarily mean they want that to be the outcome – quite the opposite in nearly all cases, though some view it with greater revulsion than others. Rather, they believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is an essential part of their negotiating armoury, even though it is common knowledge in Britain and Europe that it is no more than a bluff.The problem for Ms May is that the no-deal scenario is viewed with such horror by the great majority in the Commons that any attempt to keep it open as an option is futile. As has been obvious for some time, there are only about 50 to 100 MPs who could be said actively to prefer that outcome (ie leaving on World Trade Organisation terms) to the other options available.That means the other 550 to 600 are actively opposed to it a majority of 450 against the no-deal option. Even if a fair number of Tory MPs followed her into the ision lobby against their better judgement on a whipped vote, the prime minister would still face an even larger defeat than the historic one she suffered a few weeks ago when her withdrawal deal was\u0026nbsprejected by 432 votes to 202. \u0026nbspDefeat, then, for the government on no-deal Brexit – even on a whipped vote – is inevitable, because the rebellion within the parliamentary Conservative party would be so great as to guarantee it. Worse, arguably, it would mean significant resignations from the cabinet and wider government.Cabinet members Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark have written newspaper articles declaring as much some 15 to 20 ministers of state are also rumoured to be ready to quit – some have publicly stated that they would.Therefore, in order to save face and make the best of a bad job, Ms May will have to accept the device of a free vote in order to avoid utter humiliation.Such a prospect though merely draws attention to the political fact of life that has been obvious ever since she lost her overall majority and her moral authority in her snap election last year she has no majority in the Commons for her government nor for her flagship policy.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

The pair were in Brussels trying to secure changes to the Irish backstop ahead of MPs voting on Ms May\u0027s proposed deal next week.PM faces criticism at PMQs over rise in knife crime\u0026nbspand drop in police numbersNo-deal Brexit will trigger UK recession, OECD warnsTheresa May prepares to travel to Brussels to salvage Brexit talksJeremy Corbyn urges\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s official Jewish group not to disaffiliateMPs have been warned their Easter break may be cancelled amid concern Brexit\u0026nbspmay be delayed.Environment secretary Michael\u0026nbspGove said the chief whip Julian Smith had told Tory colleagues the planned recess may be scrapped.Mr Gove made the revelation as he was asked whether the Fisheries Bill would return to the Commons before the break, which is due to be held from April 4 to 23.He said: The Chief Whip has reminded Conservative MPs that there may not be an Easter recess.It comes after the February break was cancelled in order to allow the Commons to make progress on Brexit.Time is running out for the Commons to approve all necessary legislation ahead of Brexit on March 29, and several ministers have mooted that a delay may be needed in order to pass the key bills.Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, raises a point of order about Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary.\u0026nbspHe says the minister\u0027s office said he does not have time to appear in front of the committee next week, but then approached members of the committee offering to meet them inidually.\u0026nbspMr Benn says this is unacceptable and that it is Mr Barclay\u0027s job to appear in front of the committee before next week\u0027s crucial votes.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJohn Bercow says he cannot compel Mr Barclay to attend but that it is manifest and incontrovertible that he should do so. He adds:\u0026nbspSimply offering inidual meetings with\u0026nbspmembers of the committee does not remotely pass muster.Liberal Democrat leader\u0026nbspSir Vince Cable asks about a court ruling against the government\u0027s policy of forcing landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May says it is right that checks are carried out to ensure people are eligible for services, and that she understands the government is appealing against the ruling.\u0026nbspAnd that\u0027s the end of PMQs.Tory MP Julia Lopez says the public does not want to see politicians\u0026nbspthrow blame at each other over knife crime but instead wants a relentless focus on addressing the issue.\u0026nbspTheresa May says she is bringing together ministers, police, local councils and other agencies with a view to trying to prevent violent crime, not just tackle\u0026nbspit when it happens.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is linking\u0026nbspthe rise in violent crime to government cuts. He says privatising the probation service\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspa disaster, mental health and youth\u0026nbspservices are underfunded, youth centres have been closed and youth workers laid off, and funding for colleges and schools cut.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbspThe public services that were there to support young people have been systematically stripped away and everyone can see the consequences of that...You cannot keep communities safe on the cheap by cuts and privatisation - you have to invest in all our communities.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May says Corbyn voted\u0026nbspagainst more funding for local councils, the police\u0026nbspand schools. She says the Labour leader\u0026nbsptalks about austerity but cuts were only necessary because Labour ruined the economy. She claims Corbyn\u0027s policies\u0026nbspwill mean more borrowing, higher taxes and less money for spending, adding:\u0026nbspHe\u0027d take us right back to austerity square one.\u0026nbspAnd that\u0027s the end of their exchange.Jeremy Corbyn says violent crime has doubled since 2010. He asks when the government will provide the resources needed to help police tackle the problem and do the type of intelligence work that will have an impact.\u0026nbspMay says the government isn\u0027t just investing money but is also giving police more powers. She says Corbyn needs to explain why he voted against tougher sanctions against people found carrying knives.\u0026nbspCorbyn says crime went down when Labour was in office.Jeremy Corbyn quotes senior police officers suggesting falling\u0026nbsppolice numbers are directly linked to rising violent crime. He asks: if there are enough police offices, why did defence secretary Gavin Williamson yesterday offerto send in the army?\u0026nbspMay says the problem is not just about numbers and that the government has provided more funding. She says £460m extra is available this year, and almost £1bn next year.\u0026nbspAs expected, Jeremy Corbyn asks about knife crime, saying the 285 people stabbed to death in the last year is the highest on record.\u0026nbspHe asks what extra funding is being provided to tackle knife crime and other violent crime.\u0026nbspTheresa May says it is necessary to address the complex root causes, including involved making sure all relevant agencies have the right resources,\u0026nbsptackling gang violence, and intervening at every stage to turn young people away from violence. That is what the government is doing, she says.\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspkicks off PMQs\u0026nbspby announcing that she will hold a summit in Downing Street to discuss how to tackle the spate of knife crime in recent months.\u0026nbspTheresa May is in her place in the Commons and PMQs will get under way at minute. Stay tuned...NEW: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said it is possible that Theresa May could order Conservative MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspAppearing in front of the Commons International Trade Committee, he said he would follow the party line on how to vote if Ms May\u0027s deal is rejected by MPs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDr Fox said: I will abide by collective responsibility and I am not going to pre-empt discussions we might have in Cabinet about that.Asked whether the Cabinet could decide to back no-deal, he replied: Potentially all things are possible.A no-deal Brexit could trigger a recession in the UK, the OECD has warned.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe organisation said leaving the EU without an agreement would knock 2 per cent off UK growth.The OECD said:In such a scenario, the likely near-term recession in the United Kingdom would generate sizeable negative spillovers on growth in other countries.Although contingency measures to soften the impact of a no-deal outcome are being taken by both sides, UK-EU separation without an agreement would still be a major adverse shock for Europe and possibly elsewhere in the world, given that the United Kingdom is an important trading partner for many countries.Geoffrey Cox, speaking after returning from Brexit talks in Brussels, has told Sky News:\u0026nbspThese are very sensitive discussions\u0026nbsp- we\u0027re into the meat of the matter now. We put forward some very reasonable proposals and we\u0027re now really into the detail of\u0026nbspthe discussions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBoth sides have exchanged robust, strong views and we\u0027re now facing the real discussions. Talks will be resuming soon.Momentum has hit back at the Electoral Commission after being fined almost £16,700 for electoral offences.\u0026nbspIn a lengthy statement, the group criticised the laws it was found to have breached and said the Commission\u0027s focus on small details was comic.\u0026nbspIt said:The Electoral Commission did find some mistakes in our reporting and some clerical errors. This isn’t surprising for a new organisation which at the time was less than two years old and had 25,000 members and 150 local groups. The Conservatives likely employ more lawyers than Momentum have staff, and even getting close to fully complying with these complex regulations for a volunteer led, social movement organisation is a herculean task.\u0026nbspFor example, the law back dates regulations to a year before election day. This means organisations running campaigns in that period can be fined or even prosecuted. In the snap election, this left us in the absurd situation of asking volunteers in local groups to submit receipts for booking community halls and buying refreshments a year before polling day. All for a snap election they did not know was going to take place, in an effort to comply with regulations they did not know they would be subject to. \u0026nbspThe level of detail required under the law was often comic. In one instance, the Electoral Commission queried the purchase of a pizza, wanting to know what percentage of the pizza was eaten by staff members and what percentage by volunteers.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment to the live blogMr Cox and Mr Barclay are seeking to allay fears that the backstop could leave the UK trapped in a customs union with the EU in a bid to win over Tory MPs ahead of further votes next week.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Other packages were also found at Heathrow Airport and London City Airport, with the police saying they were bombs. Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

The offerings were meant to ask for rain, the experts believe.\u0026nbspIt emerged that the cave had been discovered, but not fully explored, by local people around 50 years ago.They told an archaeologist about the cave\u0026nbspbut he ordered it sealed – possibly to protect it – and only issued a brief report that was forgotten in Mexican government archives.The archaeologists studying the objects plan to leave them all in the cave after their analysis.Known as Balamku, the cave is about 1.7 miles east of the main pyramid of Kukulkan, also known as El Castillo or “The Castle”.Kukulcan Pyramid at the Mayan archaeological site of Chichen Itza (AFPGetty Images)Mr De Anda and his team have been exploring Chichen Itza to establish the routes and sites of the Mayan underground water system.A series of sinkhole lakes known as cenotes are visible on the surface of the site, but there are other, undiscovered water sites beneath the labyrinth of pyramids, patios and temples.Water was always central to Chichen Itza, whose name means “at the mouth of the well of the water wizards” in the Maya language.Mr De Anda said experts had crawled a few hundred metres into the cave, which in places is just 40cm high, in hopes of finding the connection to a cenote believed to lie under the pyramid of Kukulkan.“Let’s hope this leads us there. That is part of the reason why we are entering these sites, to find a connection to the cenote under the Castillo,” he said.Additional reporting by Associated PressWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dk-comp-graphic-page10kav.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit theresa may departure comment","story":"The rebuke was echoed on behalf of .million voters by Tory MP Sir Graham Brady to describe Theresa May’s three miserable years of trench warfare with Brussels.Brexiteer Brady is the respected chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs, the legendary “Men in grey suits” who have the power, rarely used, to tell leaders their time is up.“All too often it has looked asthe establishment has wanted a Brexit that looks shockingly like not leaving at all,” Mr Brady told a Sunday newspaper.He might have been describing many of those involved in the tortuous Brexit negotiations, but only one name springs to mind.And it will be Mr Brady’s job to hand her the fabled revolver and glass of whisky when that time comes.While it seems increasingly likely Britain is moving crab-like towards some sort of deal on Brexit by March , Mrs May herself is unlikely to long survive its birth.The price of “success” will be for the PM to name the day of her departure from Downing Street.Theresa May will probably have to be dragged kicking and screaming out of No.Having negotiated a deal of sorts, she will feel entitled to tie up loose ends and — more importantly for her — block Boris Johnson as her successor.She is safe from another assassination bid by MPs after seeing off last year’s abortive challenge.But the mood against her has hardened on all sides.Nick Timothy, once her closest ally, now reveals the PM was never able to see the economic upside to leaving the EU and saw Brexit as a problem “to be managed”.Her mantra, “No deal is better than a bad deal”, was meaningless.She and Chancellor Phil Hammond never intended to prepare our ports, freight terminals, tax centres and border controls for a clean-break Brexit.The loathed Northern Ireland backstop was a ruse to keep us so closely aligned that we might as well have stayed in a customs union and therefore the EU itself.From day one, Theresa May was negotiating BRINO — Brexit in Name Only.Her secretive style even infuriated Remainers such as Amber Rudd, who last week broke Cabinet ranks with her own campaign to stop Brexit.Influential Times columnist Matthew Parris, a staunch Remainer, ex-Tory MP and former May supporter, says both Remainers and Brexiteers have turned against the PM.“Theresa May, they tell me, is the Death Star of modern British politics,” Parris says.“Ideas, beliefs, loyalties, affections, trust, whole careers, real men and women, are sucked into the awful void that is Downing Street — and nothing ever comes out. Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week. Instead, they simply destroyed any last chance of using No Deal as a negotiating card.Ms Rudd once saw herself as a potential Tory leader or a “king maker” to Boris Johnson or Michael Gove.“After last week, any association with Amber would be the kiss of death not just in Westminster, but with the party at large,” said a Tory MP.“She is poison. Everyone wants to leave on March  — other than those who don’t want to leave at all.”That prospect now relies on silver-tongued Geoffrey Cox wangling an escape clause on the Northern Ireland backstop — dubbed “Cox’s codpiece”.The Attorney-General needs to sell his formula not just to Theresa May, but to fellow Leavers — including eagle-eyed veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.If they approve, Mrs May might clinch Brexit as promised this month.And then navigate her way to a dignied and honourable Therexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

like Brits who are thinking of moving to a smart meter can do at the moment.That gives people time to prepare and consider whether they would be better off, she said.But the best way of solving the problems with Universal Credit would be to plug the gaps in funding it, she said.If there was more money invested, in housing support and work allowances, half of these problems wouldnt be an issue."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ac-map-london-bombs.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"university of glasgow buildings evacuated over suspicious package just 24 hours after bombs sent to three london transport hubs","story":"The evacuations come just  hours after viable bombs were mailed to three transport hubs in London.The university confirmed at least eight buildings or offices have been evacuated after a suspect package was found in a mailroom at around .am this morning.Eye-witnesses said students were screamed at to keep away! as police formed an exclusion zone around cleared buildings.In a second incident, the Royal Bank of Scotland building in Edinburgh was also been evacuated following reports of a suspicious package at around .am today.The RBS package was found to be a  alarm around three hours later, with police confirming it contained promotional goods.Police Scotland remain at the scene at the University of Glasgow.A force spokeswoman said: Police received two reports of suspicious packages at University of Glasgow and Royal Bank of Scotland, Edinburgh.Police are in attendance and both buildings have been evacuated.

Manchester, claims he made  trips to the dentist after the braces he had fitted between September  and June  repeatedly snapped and fell apart, leaving his teeth in the wrong position.Oliver, who hoped the £, braces would give him the perfect smile, claims his teeth were made to look even worse than before and was only able to eat soup for weeks at a time due to the unbearable pain.After a four-year court case, dentist Dr Reesa Moosa, based at Ravat and Ray Dental Care in Bolton, settled with the -year-old support worker out of court for the five figure sum, although the dental practice did not admit liability.Dad-of-two Oliver, who has been left with permanent damage to his teeth, said: I wanted to have a little bit of work done to straighten my teeth – my front two teeth were slightly bent, but nothing dramatic.But once the braces were put on, Oliver started having problems.He said: I thought I had a high pain threshold but it just didnt seem to settle and the pain would be ongoing for four to five weeks.I just thought the pain was normal with the procedure, but it became unbearable.Eventually, I told the dentist to take them off but when I came home and showed my mum she was horried.My teeth were yellow and twisted – they looked even worse than before.Olivers braces were fitted at the end of November , but just three weeks later he ed to the dentist claiming they had become loose before a piece of metal allegedly later became dislodged, cutting into his cheek and causing it to bleed.By February , Oliver was also complaining about an emerging gap between his upper front teeth and said over the following months he was in the dentist’s chair another seven times because of the braces.He also claims he eventually discovered Dr Moosa was not a qualied orthodontist and an NHS website for the practice also described the dentist as having the Bachelor of Dental Surgery Qualication and not the higher award needed to become an orthodontist.Oliver said: As time went on and they were trying to move my teeth so much, they were adding more and more bits of metal into my mouth.The braces actually ended up being on for around  months.When they asked me how much longer I would like them on for, I thought shouldnt you be telling me when they should be removed Throughout the whole  months my teeth were never cleaned properly during each visit when the braces were removed and I was told not to worry about it.Oliver added: I was refunded the money I paid for the work, but I was later told that dentist was not a qualied orthodontist but was able to carry out orthodontic work.If I had been told that from the start I wouldnt have gone ahead with the braces.A spokesperson at Ravat and Ray Dental Care said: The practice was not involved in any court case with the patient and has not paid out any settlement in court.The aim of the practice is always to provide the best possible care to all our patients.Dr Reesa Moosa said: I cannot comment on this case because of my duty of confidentiality."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000004798861.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal navy russian ships uk

preferred Brexit outcome, which he is now certain would be a softer Brexit and a customs union.Summing up his prediction, Mr Smith told the Cabinet: “A vote against the deal is a vote for delay, and a vote that will end up with a customs union”.Depressing the room further, the Chief Whip also said the Commons showdown on Tuesday was still looking “very, very tight” for the Government.Despite the increased pressure on them, the votes of around  hardline Brexiteers as well as the DUP’s  MPs were still hanging on whether Attorney General Geoffrey Cox can negotiate a clear and legally-binding escape from the Irish backstop.If her deal does fall through, Mrs May was last week forced to agree to give MPs votes on Wednesday and Thursday next week on a No Deal Brexit or a delay up to the end of June.One Cabinet Minister told The Sun on Tuesday night: “The Chief was very clear about what’s comingwe can’t win this vote. If we lose it’s out of our hands and Parliament will decide and it all gets very uncertain.“We’ll be in a customs union for a start.In more bad news for No, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told Talk Radio on Tuesday that he thought it was “very unlikely” that Mr Cox will come back with “anything that satisfies Parliament”.He blamed a Remainer Tory ministers’ revolt last week for “having thrown away the option of no deal”The Cabinet discussion came after the Foreign Secretary on Tuesday signalled that embattled Mrs May will be forced to offer Tory MPs a free vote on whether to go for a No Deal Brexit or to delay ither deal is voted downJeremy Hunt opened the door to the extraordinary scenario as feuding Tory MPs’ competing calls on the PM spiralled.Refusing Brexiteers’ demands on Tuesday to whip against any Article  extension, Mr Hunt instead warned that a Brexit deal was “the only solution”.Quizzed on a free vote, Mr Hunt said: “That is something that the Government has to make a decision on, and it is not for me to say that now”.Party grandees instead said that the Tories were so split on the issue that a free vote was the only way to avoid mass resignations from the Government form both camps.Former Tory minister Nick Boles tweeted: “Both parliamentary parties are split.

The move - which would be the biggest single liberalisation of the British economy in history - would ensure prices dont rocket for customers. But critics warn it could trigger floods of imports from steel to ceramics that would put UK producers at risk. And it could hamper the UKs ability to strike future trade deals by taking away a key bargaining chip.  The process to decide whichtarfswill be changed has reportedly been carried out in secret by the Department for International Trade, the Treasury and other departments in a Cabinet sub-committee. Some imports including cars, beef, lamb, dairy and some lines of textiles would remain subject to levies in order to protect sensitive industries. However items including component parts used to make cars, many finished food products and some farm produce including cereals, could be exempt fromtarfs.  Business Secretary Greg Clark did not deny the reports. Instead, he acknowledged it was a very dficult choice whether to either hike tarfs on goods from the EU, or cut them for the rest of the world. He said today: You would need to make immediate changes to your tarf schedule. We’d have to decide whether the decide zero tarfs to the rest of the world. However, he confirmed that the new tarf schedules would only be published after a string of Commons votes next week. MPs are due to vote by March  on Theresa Mays Brexit deal, followed by a vote on No Deal on March , and a vote on delaying Brexit on March . He acknowledged that the changes would have big implications for some sectors, including ceramics.  We have been consulting with dferent industry sectors on this. It has big implications for dferent sectors, he told BBC Radio s Today programme. Ceramics is an industry that I know very well. It has been subject to very unfair competition, to dumping of very cheap ceramic exports from the Far East, from China.Anna Turley, a Labour MP on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, said the reported tarf cuts were unbelievable.She tweeted: Is the government giving up all pretence of Britain being able to make anything any more  This will open the door to floods of imports from steel to ceramics.

The flimsy proposals she’s unveiled today won’t even guarantee your existing rights after Brexit. And they certainly won’t stop workers’ rights in the UK from falling behind those in the rest of Europe. Theresa May says our rights at work won’t be watered down. But her promises are worthless when she is unlikely to be in post this time next year. And there’s nothing to stop a future right-wing Tory government from tearing these rules up altogether. In January, I met with Theresa May and I was clear that when it comes to jobs and workers’ rights, warm words wouldn’t cut it. After all, we’re talking about hard-won protections that really matter to working people. Paid holidays, time off for mums and dads, equal pay for women, limits on working hours.   Working people need a cast-iron, legal guarantee that rights like these will be safe after Brexit, and that guarantee should be written into the deal. But instead of a binding guarantee, all the prime minister has offered is yet more weasel words. She’s asking us to trust that her government and her party will protect our rights at work. But why should working people trust the party that introduced employment tribunal fees that priced thousands of low-paid workers out of justice  That made it easier for bosses to sack people by doubling the qualying period for unfair dismissal  That refuses to ban zero-hours contracts even though they’re ruining people’s lives  That’s not what leading the world on workers’ rights looks like.

In a letter to the MP, MrCorbynacknowledged that a very small group of staff in his office were asked by the partys governance and legal unitto help clear the backlog of cases that had built up.   He said that in an act of good faith his staff had complied but that decisions remained with the GLU and that there had never been any attempt to overrule them. And he reacted angrily to a suggestion that Dame Margaret had a recording of their meeting last week to discuss the issue, despite an agreement that it would be private. I was therefore extremely disappointed to learn on theToday programme that you have an audio recording of the meeting, he wrote. Neither me nor my staff were informed that you intended to record the meeting, my permission was not sought, nor granted. I consider this to be a total breach of trust and privacy.  MrCorbynsaid the help provided by staff from the Leader of the Oppositions Officehad been during the transition from former general secretary Iain McNicol to his successor, Jennie Formby. It would appear that during the transition period between Iain McNicols departure and Jennie Formby taking over, a very small group of staff in the leaders office were approached by now former GLU staff members at head office, and were asked for help in clearing a backlog of cases, he said. This help included a clear request for advice on a small number of cases. In an act of good faith, staff in my office complied with this request in order to assist the party. The decision-making remained with staff members from GLU, and there was never any attempt to overrule them. As soon as Jennie Formby started as general secretary, this process was overhauled, and advice from Loto JeremyCorbynwas no longer sought on inidual cases. MrCorbynalso rejected criticism by Dame Margaret of the proposed appointment of former justice secretary Lord Falconer to look at the issue.

The International Trade Secretary faced broad ridicule last week when the Mirror revealed the cost of the online radio show, branded a vanity project and a complete waste of money. ‘Local to Global’, part of the Government’s ‘Exporting is Great’ campaign, was recorded a bid to encourage British firms to export their wares. But the government revealed there have been just , downloads or listens in total, across the  episodes of the podcast, plus a  minute preview episode. Asked whether he thought the podcasts eye-watering budget was good value for money, Mr Fox told a committee of MPs it was impossible to say whether it had been worth it.   He said: We have identied about , businesses in the UK who say they could be exporting but are not exporting so we need to try to get the appropriate messages to them to get them into exporting because that generates income to the UK We use a range of media on that. Print media, podcasts, it’s impossible to know at the beginning of them what effect they will have, but at the end of each of them they are subjected to a review to ensure lessons are learned. Asked againit presented value for taxpayers money, he said: It depends how many of the businesses that actually listened to it actually became exporters. If all , who listened to it became exporters then I’d say that was a successful project. If none of them did, I would question its value for money but that will depend on the review that we have to get data.   The pound, cost of the producing and promoting the podcast means each listener cost the taxpayer pound.. That could have paid for a week’s worth of free school meals for a secondary school child. In response to a parliamentary question, Trade Minister Graham Stuart admitted: “As of am on the nd of February there have been a total of , downloads listens of the ‘Local to Global’ podcast.” In a subsequent answer, the department revealed the production of the podcast series itself cost pound,, with a further pound, spent on promotion.

The Home Secretary declared a new rash of people attempting to come into the UK on dinghies across the Channel in January a ‘major incident’. But Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt told the Mirror: “I think we ought to bear proportions in mind. “A quarter of Lebanon’s population is refugee. That’s the equivalent of the UK having  million refugees, not  people coming over on a dinghy.” Speaking at a London conference on support for Jordan last week, Mr Burt said the Governments newly announced funding commitments for the Middle East state would “help in the process” of reducing the number of refugees who choose to seek asylum in European countries, including the UK.   “If you’re a refugee your circumstances are rarely particularly good,” he said. “If you’re in Jordan there’s a chance you’re going to go back to Syria. If you’re in Altrincham, that’s rather less likely.” Home Secretary Sajid Javid declared a major incident over Christmas after  migrants were picked up in the English Channel. This dropped to just  in January.   In the latest incident, a boat carrying  suspected migrants, including a baby and two children was intercepted by Border Force last Tuesday morning. Home Secretary Sajid Javid previously sparked anger by questioning whether those attempting to cross the Channel are genuine asylum seekers.

The shocking example came as MPs discussed so-called natural migration to the six-in-one benefit system. Existing benefit claimants are being spared a move to UC until , and will be given transition payments to avoid their income suddenly dropping. But those who have a change in circumstances now are moved immediately without those payments.   Charities told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee the drop in income often happened for unfair reasons and increased the risk of homelessness. Laura Dewar, Policy Officer at Gingerbread, said it was “unfair” and “pretty arbitrary” that people don’t get protection “just because of the timing of it”. Anastasia Berry of the MS Society said triggers for switching to UC are often “unavoidable, unnecessary and out of somebody’s control” - at a time when someone is struggling anyway. Ayaz Manji, Senior Policy and Campaigns Officer at mental health charity Mind, said the problem was not simply UC - but a combination of changes at once. He told MPs: “When you talk about financial losses that can be anywhere, on the lower end and probably more unusually, about pound a month but more often than that we’re seeing pound,  sometimes more a month particularly for people who are in work.  “It’s very hard to see this as a neat or clean edge of winners and losers on the balance sheet “Because often what’s happening is when people are naturally migrating, an awful lot of other things are happening at the same time. “A colleague at a local Mind was talking to me about one of their clients named Emma. “She ended up naturally migrating after having a PIP reassessment and losing her entitlement to PIP. “And she ended up as a result of all that being worse off by about pound a month. “But at the same time HMRC had discovered a historic overpayment so her first UC claim was about pound less than it should be. “She was asked to go for another WCA after migrating even though that shouldn’t have happened “And as a result of all these pressures happening at the same time in transition, she started to develop suicidal thoughts during that time. “She found it very dficult even to engage with the advisor at the local Mind to carry on attending her appointments. “And she actually needed quite a lot of help from friends and family.” He added: We do need to see natural migration paused in a greater range of circumstances.” Charities warned of the risk of homelessness. Maeve McGoldrick, Head of Policy and Campaigns at Crisis, said: It’s that drop in income combined with the delays and errors in Universal Credit and combined with other cuts, particularly LHA. It’s the cumulative impact of the money you’re losing is putting housing at severe risk. Anastasia Berry of the MS Society said there had “definitely” been an increase in risk of homelessness. “Our helpline has said they’ve seen in increase in the number of calls around homelessness, she said. Early results from a survey that closed last week showed % borrowed from family or friends and % borrowed from a loan or credit cards, she said. She added: “A person with MS told us they’ve had to use food banks to feed their family, they’re now  months behind on council tax andit wasn’t for their mother in law they would have been evicted because they couldn’t pay the rent.” Laura Dewar, Policy Officer at Gingerbread, said for some people “housing associations have stepped in and are letting there be a pause in rent”.

Susan and I laughed until our sides hurt at the nickname we had both been given. Id once thought of it as affectionate and sweetly romantic - but now the moniker which tied me to this wonderful woman stood for nothing but lies. Well were good women - and now he has lost both of us, we told one another. We were duped by Anthony. I had made le-changing decisions for this man in the name of a very misplaced love. But, through our pain, loss and deep betrayal, Susan and I found one another.   I met Anthony in , and was smitten from the first dinner date when he took me to a fancy restaurant on the ocean front. He was ft, extremely handsome and, even better - a true gentleman. Id got lucky with this one. He opened every door, paid for every date and after that first dinner, he gently placed his coat over my shoulders as we walked along the sea-front. I was during those heady, wonderful first few weeks and months of our relationship that I fell for him. It was surreal - like something out of a movie. It felt wonderful to feel those butterflies again. He made me feel beautul, showering me with affection. But something didnt feel entirely right from the beginning. He would disappear for weeks at a time without warning, and when I suggested he didnt feel as strongly about me, he told me his feelings actually ran so deep for me, it frightened him. Ive never met a good woman like you before, he would tell me. The periods away continued, but after two years of dating, we grew incredibly close and began talking about our future together. We planned our future in the sunshine, we laughed together, we held hands while eating at restaurants - we were in love.   A year passed by and despite our undeniable chemistry, I still felt something wasnt right and Anthony wasnt fully letting me into his le. I asked him about why I hadnt met any of his children, so he invited his son to join us for dinner - although he was always too busy. Never dreaming this man could go on to hurt me so badly, I went on to honour his request to join his church as a way of proving my commitment. My commitment  It really all seems laughable now. But I did just that, and joined in the hope of one day becoming his we. Though I still had some unease about our relationship, I felt more confident because he asked me to be a part of something I knew was incredibly meaningful to him. Then came the call that would change everything, shattering this so-called love story to pieces. Wed been together for five years, and Anthony had gone into hospital for minor surgery. The operation went well, he told me assuredly in the unexpected phone call. I thought your surgery was scheduled for tomorrow I said, surprised and confused how he hadnt filled me in. Anthony told me doctors had managed to move it forward a day, adding that he was in quarantine for a few more days so it wouldnt be worth visiting. But this was the man I loved, laying in hospital, alone and in pain.   I did what any caring person would and hopped in the car, drove the two hours to his hospital to pay him a surprise visit. And what a surprise it turned out to be - for us all. After checking in and receiving my visitors pass, I took the lt to the sixth floor and I made my way to Anthonys room. A nurse was working on him, so I said hello to him from across the room. Something was obviously not right - Anthony meekly replied hello, but seemed quiet and cold towards me. He had never acted like this around me before and this was not the man I knew. I recognised Anthonys son sat at his bedside from pictures, but couldnt place the woman he was chatting to. She smiled warmly at me and even got up to give me her seat before pulling a spare chair over and sitting down again. We made small talk about the beautul view of Manhattan from Anthonys hospital window. She was easy to talk to and I instantly liked her. We even shared a few laughs before I started the introductions. Im Kathy, by the way. Im Susan, she replied, holding out her hand with a warm smile. In the moments that followed, I had no idea Id grow to love that welcoming, kind smile - a hint at the beautul person she is. Susan - the name rattled around my head. I thought back to a year earlier when Anthony had mentioned his ex-girlfriends name was Susan.   He assured me then that their relationship was long over, telling me I have no idea what happened to her. I didnt want to act too hastily, but instead tried making small talk with Anthony - who by this point refused to engage with me and seemed really tense. I had to get to the bottom of this. “So, how long have you known Anthony  I asked Susan. For eighteen years., she replied frankly. My stomach dropped. I askedwe could talk in the corridor, hearing Anthony mumble, Oh brother, here we go. Here comes the pow-wow, as we left. Alone in the hallway, we told each other everything. I told Susan I had been in a relationship with Anthony for the past five years. I told her how he often discussed our future together and how he had suggested we move somewhere warm like South Carolina. Susans face grew more and more distraught as I continued to tell her about my relationship with him. Then came my turn. Susan took a deep breath before telling me she had been in a committed relationship with Anthony for eighteen years and had even gone shopping for engagement rings before his surgery. I couldnt believe what I was hearing. My le as Id come to know it had ended in this cold hospital hallway.   Then my heart broke all over again - this time, for Susan. Susan asked meAntony ever criticised me, put me down, critiqued my clothes, make-up and body shape. I was stunned, but after promising her Id be % honest, I told Susan that Anthony had made me feel beautul. And he did. He had always treated me with respect and kindness. He was gentle, loving and soft-spoken with me. Susan outlined a very dferent side to him I had never known. I asked Susan, How did we not run into each other at Anthonys home  Didnt you see the bar of Irish Spring soap I left in his shower  She rolled her eyes, I used it, she replied. The more we talked, the more we learned about the two lives Anthony had been living and how he kept us apart. Susan was a good-looking woman who seemed smart and caring, so I asked her why she hadnt left. She didnt respond, but stared blankly at the floor of the hallway. I assured her my relationship with Anthony would end, before walking back into his room to collect my things. I told Anthony everything, but he had nothing to say. He knew it was over.   As I was about to leave, something incredible happened. Anthonys son stopped me, apologised for his fathers behavior and askedhe could hug me. I drove home in a daze, thinking of Susan, wondering why she had stayed with him all these years. She deserved so much better -we both did. I was broken hearted and I felt physically sick for days after that afternoon in the hospital. Discovering Anthony was a player and a liar hit me hard. How could I have been so gullible  Did he think we would never find out what he was doing  My mind was racing with so many questions. Two months after our chance meeting in the hospital, Susan looked up my number and reached out to me. She told me that she had some more questions for me and I answered all of them the best that I could. Susan said she had hoped to marry Anthony one day, but he always had a reason why he wouldnt go through with the wedding - and it was usually a cruel one. Our regular chats on the phone soon turned to topics outside of our ex. We lted each other up and the more we learned about each other, the more we liked.

The unidentied man, dressed all in black and on his knees, was holding a sign by his side which appears to read On Probation For Miss Foxx. Miss Foxx describes herself as a purveyor of femdom - female dominantion - and that the incident was public humiliation. The bizarre scene played out at Waterloo station, London, as a pair of baffled-looking police officers and a large crowd of confused travellers, looked on. Video footage taken last Thursday was posted to social media by Dutty Boukmann with the caption: Whose dad is this    The clip begins with a shot of the bearded man kneeling on the train station floor.

Other people can be seen going past smiling or watching the scene in disbelief.   The man filming can be heard saying: “And it’s just a fetish she said. That’s why everyone’s so happy about it.” A spokeswoman for British Transport Police said: “We were made aware of it and alerted to it. “However, there was no real offence committed, and therefore there were no arrests or cautions. “They were spoken to by officers and left the station shortly after.”A Google search for Miss Foxx reveals a UK-based dominatrix, offering her services as: UK’s finest and sexiest, English, financial domination, humiliation, cuckolding, ebonatrix, goddess”. A Twitter page, purporting to be Miss Foxx, posted videos of the man on the lead in Waterloo Station, referred to as: “Public B***h Walk.”  In a Twitter post, she wrote: “I love public humiliation.

Cafe Number  is a membership-based, not-for-profit citizens supermarket and cafe. The outlet sells surplus food donated from supermarkets at a discount, with prices at least two-thirds lower than a normal shop. It also serves wholesome, healthy and affordable meals where a family of four can dine for under pound. And after visitors have completed their shopping, they can sit with a coffee and speak to specialist advisors who will help get them back into work, or work with them to consolidate their debt into a manageable payment. The team at the cafe, which is based in Birkenhead, Merseyside, also offer interview techniques, help with improving CVs and even secure them work. “The idea is that we help people help themselves. They stay with us until we sort them out and when they are flourishing, they can move on,” said project coordinator Andrew Forsey.  “We also want to enable people on low incomes to access affordable food in a dignied and welcoming environment. Andrew works with Birkenhead’s independent MP Frank Field, and the cafe is run in partnership with Feeding Birkenhead, a coalition of local community groups. “A driving force is to offer an intervention to people. For someone who is struggling from week to week, it can sometimes just take one event like a broken fridge or unexpected large bill to find yourself in crisis. So shopping with us for a while will help keep them ticking over while we can advise over how best to get a grip of underlying debt problems.” Members are able to take advantage of the scheme for up to six months while they find their feet. “We are working with around  iniduals and their families,” said Andrew. “These are people that were mostly referred by a local housing association but in future we are working with people who come to us from job center.” In the future the centre hopes to help in other areas, like cookery classes. “We have had members tell us, that they buy the food but could do with help with ideas of how to make meals, so that is something we will look to launch soon too.” Staff and volunteers at Number  have also been specically chosen from the community. Those who have been out of work for a while or who need a confidence boost have been employed. Andrew added: “An unexpected boost has been the benefit to people’s mental health, those who have felt isolated and have come here for a shop, a meal, a coffee, have reported feeling uplted.”For more Stories of Local Pride, click here"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton blackpool live duchess","story":"NewsKate Middleton in Blackpool LIVE: Duchess and husband William arrive in seaside townThe Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William will take in tourist attractions in the seaside town including Blackpool TowerShareByDavid ColemanRussell MyersUpdated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-brings-meghan-stage-front-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middleton-blackpool-live-duchess- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Kate Middleton and Prince William will visit Blackpool this afternoon.

It’s a great privilege to be back in this exciting, buzzing space,this time as President of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trusta wecreated for YOU where your ideas and creativity will be taken seriously– because it’s YOU that are making the most impact in your communities. I am proud to stand before you and see you just as enthusiastic as I remembered. With all of that activism, somemight think you’d be exhausted –but look at you,- you know the secret! That in giving back, in fighting the good fight, it doesn’t exhaust you, it energizes you. To be amongst all of you progressive, motivated,open minded,change-makers, is what gives me hope for the future. Your optimism is inspiring -you see opportunities where other people see challengesyou seek solutions when others just focus on problems. You are the most engaged generation in history.You care about values, doing the right thing,and championing the causes that will shape your future. You don’t judge someone based on how they look,where they’re from, or how they identy. In this room, you see the world for what it is -vibrant, colourful, mixed and full of promise. That is who you are, and that is what makes me feel proud to stand in your presence as you tackle the world’s greatest issues.And you guys know as well as I do, we’ve still got so much to do. As far as I see it, thereare two absolutely crucial issues that we need to focus on,and my hope is that a  more issues will be cured in the process. First, let’s take OUR mental health which you’ve embraced whole heartedly,breaking the generational stigma and helping to normalise the conversation. After all, mental illness is about recovery, mental health is about consciousness,mental fitness is about well-being. To be happy is to be mindful, mindful of your feelings, mindful of your surroundings, and mindful of the . billion other humans that inhabit this planet. And while we’re on the topic of health, let’s talk about the health of our planet too. Climate change, is a humanitarian issue not a political one,and one where we’ve been far too slow in waking up to the issues and acting on the damaging impact our ways of living are having on the world. We now have the facts,the science, the technology and the ability to save not just our planet, but ourselves. I know you don’t sit back and wait for solutions,you take action and create them. Our world’s greatest assets are threatened every day and it is SO important that we support local communities to safeguard every element of this incredible world. Every forest, every river, every ocean, every coastline, everyinsect, everywild animal.Every blade of grass, every ray of sun and every rain drop is crucial to our survival. It is all connected, we are all inter-connected.You in this room understand that and are already making this a safer, healthier and more resilient home for all of us and for generations to come. And for that I applaud you. If we look at the world we’re living in, I know it can feel challenging sometimes,but your role is to shine the light. Every day you are inundated with an overexposure of advertising and mainstream media, social media and endless comparisons,distorting the truth, and trying to manipulate the power of positive thinking.But you don’t let them sway you. Because you don’t need to hide behind your device to share your voice.You confidently voice your opinions because you can embrace them proudly. As my we often reminds me with one of her favourite quotesbyMartin Luther King Jr. -“Darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that.Hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that.” You aren’t always going to agree,you may find yourselves frustrated with the older generation when it seems like they don’t care. But try to remove that judgment. Try to remember that not everyonesees the world the way you do,but that doesn’t mean they don’t care. It means you have the incredible opportunity to help reshape mindsets,to empower those around you to think outside the box, and to work with you, not against you, to find solutions. You know thatyou don’t stand for something you’ll fall for anything. So let that be your true north, let that be your call to action -to inspire those who stand for nothing, to stand for something -and to stand WITH you. So what’s next, what’s on your to-do list starting now... Be braver Be stronger Be kind to each other Be kind to yourselves Have less screen time, and more face to face time Exceed expectations Eliminate plastics Conserve water Protect wildle and their unique habitat Keep empathy alive Ask your friends how they are doing and listen to the answer Be honest Take risks Change your thoughts and change the world Dare to be thegreatest generation of all time I am with you, we are with you!"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle photo made palace","story":"NewsMeghan Markle photo which made palace change social media rules after vile abuseKensington Palace are clamping down on the vile comments aimed at the Duchess of Sussex - and its believed one photo sparked it allShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsMeghan Markles belly button popped under the Dior gown during a visit to Morocco\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Earlier this week the Royal family took the unprecedented step of issuing a warning to social media trolls.

Daniel Neagu, , went on a  minute rampage - with music blaring from the cab radio - following a row over pound, in unpaid wages. He used a GoPro camera and an iPhone to film himself swearing, whistling the tune to Freed From Desire and saying: Beautul houses, you have to take it down and rebuild it, thats because you didnt want to pay me. Judge Stephen Warner heard over pound, of damage was caused to the five McCarthy and Stone retirement cottages. He said unknown onlookers who encouraged Neagu should be ashamed of their conduct. Sentencing, the judge said the footage was truly shocking, adding: Its quite clear from your demeanour that you were perfectly relaxed and quite unashamed.  This was planned, deliberate and wanton vandalism involving the destruction of other peoples property undertaken by you as a pure act of revenge. It caused financial loss on a very signicant scale. Romanian Neagu, who came to the UK in , broke onto the building site in Buntingford, Herts., on August  last year. He claimed subcontractor building firm Fentons owed his business Danny Boy Ltd pound,.  But St Albans Crown Court heard Fentons withheld the money after one of its vehicles, which was fitted with a tracker, ended up in Romania. Prosecutor Richard Hutchings played the judge footage that Neagu shot from the digger cab as he carried out his wrecking spree. The defendant covered his face in the dock as he watched the blue-armed digger with scoop bucket crash into  three-bed and  two-bed bungalows, smashing them down to the foundations. He could be heard shoutingf***ing s*** company and sang the dance song Oh Nar Nar as he took his revenge.   He told onlookers: I dont blame you for calling the police. They ask for pound, for these homes. They dont have pound, to pay . I wanted to give them a lesson. Hertfordshire police arrived and he was arrested.   He told officers he did not have the money to pay six employees, causing his family to be threatened. Neagu said he took Fentons van to Romania but claimed it would be ed when he was paid, adding: They have to learn not to take the piss out of the workers. The cost of the destruction, in excess of pound,, did not include rebuilding the two and three-bedroom houses. Insurers covered the cost of the bungalows, which were marketed for pound, for a two-bedroom and pound, for a three-bedroom. New owners of the properties were just weeks away from moving in when the attack happened.  Neagu, of Harrow, north-west London, initially denied criminal damage but changed his plea in January. His lawyer Andrew Campbell said he was provoked and called a midget and a gypsy by bosses who he confronted about payment. He added: It is an extraordinary case. He provided the evidence against himself. He had carried out these actions as a public demonstration that he had not been paid. Theres a strange sort of logic in it, but theres a logic in it.

Sarah Elizabeth Morris was talking to her partner when daughter Rosie,  months, drowned. Morris, , has been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty, which she denies, North Wales Live reports. Rosie was left in the bath for prolonged periods, Mold Crown Court in Wales was told on the first day of Morris trial. The court heard that the mum - who has been unable to provide a clear account of what happened - was on the phone to her then partner Sarah Swindles for almost  minutes while her children were in the bath. Oliver Saxby, prosecuting, told jurors that Morris, who had been popping her head around the door on occasion, had gone to check on the twins after Ms Swindles advised her to do so.  But when she did, she discovered Rosie had downed. Morris, from Bagilit in Flintshire, Wales, called her friend Jemma Egerton, who she had known for about a month, to tell her that Rosie wasnt breathing and that she didnt know what had happened to her, the court heard. After almost  minutes on the phone, Ms Egerton ended the call by advising Morris to dial . Instead, Morris rushed into the street holding Rosie upside down and shouting for help, leaving her son in the bath. Her neighbour Christine Murphy called for help before taking them both back inside. There were prolonged periods when she was not checking on them and had forgotten about them and the danger they were in, said Mr Saxby.  Neither baby had any child support with them in the bathroom to stabilise or prevent them from falling over. They were left in an extremely vulnerable position. As a result of her failure to supervise the twins as they sat unsupported, one of them drowned. In a police interview following the incident, Morris said that, before she found her daughter, she was in the kitchen doing the washing and heating the towels so they they were warm when they got out of the bath. She told officers that it was after she had been for a cigarette in her bedroom that she thought she heard the plug being pulled in the bath. Morris said she went to look and that was when she found Rosie lying on her back in the bath. She said she performed CPR on her daughter before running out into the street for help. The court heard she told doctors at the hospital where Rosie was taken that she had only left the children for five minutes to get some towels when she found her daughter lying in the bath on her back. The trial continues.

The teenager was mute and could not chew so instead held food in her mouth until saliva broke it down. Regardless of where she was she constantly spat, snfing and blowing her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. Genie occasionally touched herself intimately without caring who was near and, despite getting upset and angry, she never cried. The -year-old showed understanding of only her own name and two phrases - stop it and no more. She was abnormally pale, grossly malnourished and the lead her father kept her on had caused a thick, bruised callus to form on her backside.   The case of Genie the feral child became known to the world as one of the most horric examples of child abuse and neglect ever uncovered in the United States. From , she had been imprisoned in the second bedroom of her family home by her dad, Clark Wiley, because he suspected she was mentally disabled.

His first child died after being left in a cold garage and a second from birth complications. A third, a boy named John, survived, followed five years later by the girl who would become known as Genie. According to researchers, Clark did not speak to her and he instructed her we, Irene, and son John to do the same. From -months-old, Genie had been strapped into a handmade straightjacket and tied to a potty chair in a silent room during the day.   At night, she was locked inside a cot with a wire cover and fed almost entirely on liquids. Clark growled and barked at his daughter like a dog andshe made a noise, he beat her with a stick.

Both are convinced that what they saw was the elusive creature, said to dwell in the deepest, darkest depths of the Loch Ness in the Scottish highlands. The mysterious images showing a dark shape in the water have reignited public fascination for the fabled water beast. But today the world’s two most famous Nessie hunters warned people not to get carried away - claiming the monster DOESNT exist and the sightings are no more than a figment of peoples imaginations.   Naturalist Adrian Shine has led the Loch Ness Project since  when he began searching for the monster after constructing a manned observation chamber called Machan. Self-styled Nessie hunter Steve Feltham was convinced he would catch the creature when he moved to Loch Ness in . He lives in a former mobile library on the beach so he could dedicate his le to finding the truth. But both men say they have reached the disappointing conclusion that Nessie there never was a prehistoric monster living in the loch. And they claimed that the recent sighting, like the more than a thousand other Nessie sightings down the years, have a much less fantastic explanation.  Speaking to , Adrian said: “My view has evolved somewhat. “The fact is that well over a thousand honest and sober people have seen monsters in Loch Ness. Yet over  years of expeditions have failed to fine them. “Either we’re fairly bad at what we do or there’s another reason for that. “I think it’s fair to say we’d all like there to be a Loch Ness monster. But equally there are people who will see what they want to see.” And Steve said: “When I arrived her full-time nearly  years ago I was looking for plesiosaurus, those dinosaurs with long necks.  But now I’m not looking for dinosaurs, I’ve ruled that out, which is disappointing for me as I’ve had a lelong fascination with Nessie. “There are people out there who are incredibly gullible and believe every picture they see and bit of evidence. “The internet has made it very easy for people to upload photos and cause a Nessie sensation with many believing it really is Nessie until proven otherwise. “Every day there are many two or three decent interesting photographs, bit of films or pieces of evidence to study, but there are  times as many  alarms. I’d still like to be proven wrong, but I think the possibility of Nessie being the monster we’d like her to be is pretty low down the list.”  The Loch Ness Monster mystery is supposed to have begun with Irish monk Saint Columba’s encounter with a water beast by the River Ness back in . Around , D Mackenzie said he spotted something in the loch that looked like an upturned boat squirming the water. But Nessie fever hit an all-time high in  when George Spice and his we saw a long-necked prehistoric creature walking in front of their car, lurching towards the loch. That same year a motorcyclist called Arthur Grant was shaken after claiming an unexpected encounter with the same creature when he nearly hit it while driving around the water. The latest sightings appear to be of a similar prehistoric monster.  Lisa Brennan, , said she saw a dark object around ft tall above the water surface as she and her boyfriend were driving around the loch on February . She said: “I shouted, ‘Oh my God, I’ve just seen something. “By the time I had got the camera ready on my phone the object had lowered into the water so I only managed to get as much as I did on the photo.” Her snap shows an L-shaped black object which could be taken as the head and neck of Nessie. And on February , avid Nessie hunter Eoin O’Faodhagain was watching the Loch Ness webcam from his home in Castlefin, Co Donegal, when he claimed he saw a dark object appear briefly before disappearing. He said: “I knew immediately I had spotted Nessie, and not a boat.  Boats do not disappear from screen. Boats do not disappear from screen and there was no further appearance of an object in that area after  minutes of watching.” But the Nessie experts said the sightings are most often naturally-occurring phenomena, but when they are seen in Loch Ness the first conclusive people draw is that they have been the monster. Adrian said: “The first time anyone reported seeing a long-necked sea serpent was in . Nessie then became a national sensation, probably relating to the depression and the time, and also the release earlier in the year of the film King Kong, where people saw prehistoric monsters fighting. “After that everyone began to claim to see long necks in the loch.  “In fact the huge majority of sightings are caused by the illusions that the loch is capable of creating, precisely because of the monster legends. “If you see something in Loch Ness that you don’t recognise, you will being to see phenomena which will form to the stereotype of the sea serpent. “Many of the sightings of a creature swimming along the loch can easily be explained as boat wakes on the water. Yet the loch has had boat wakes since . Only when the idea brewed that there was a monster or strange animal in the lake that phenomena which would otherwise be unremarkable were labelled in that way.  “It’s not impossible that people have seen unusual creatures in Loch Ness. Migratory fish such as salmon enter the loch, and seals also get in following the salmon. “My best guess is that what people are seeing is a fish like a sturgeon, which is very primitive and reptilian in appearance and can grow very big.” He said one current research project might hold some answers. A team of international scientists led by geneticist Neil Gammell collected water samples from the loch, with DNA testing taking to place to find out what animals have lived there. He said: “We took samples from all over the lake, from the top to the bottom of the water.  We’re waiting on a species list taken from shed skin cells, which might tell us what animal people have been being.” Steve also believes the Nessie mystery may one day be explained as a giant fish - but says he hasn’t entirely given up hope of finding that the Loch Ness monster is the prehistoric being he always dreamed it would be. He said: “My favourite is the wels catfish, the second-biggest freshwater fish in the world, although we’re no where nearer to saying it is definitely this or that. It doesn’t mean that it will turn out to be a catfish, but it’s my best guess at the moment. “However, I’d love to be proven wrong. At the moment a prehistoric sea creature is low down on the list of possibilities, but I haven’t taken it off the list just yet.” "},{"url":null,"title":"over under toilet roll debate","story":"NewsOver or under  Toilet roll debate finally settled thanks to  year-old manualAre you team Up and Over  or team Hanging Under ShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsDoes this look acceptable to you  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailApparently, there are two types of people in the world.

Bolsonaro posted the video last night, at the end of the South American nation’s famous carnival celebrations, showing two men dancing on the top of a bus stop in Sao Paulo as people watch on the street below.One man appears to perform a sex act on himself before the other man lowers his shorts and begins to urinate on his hair.

Two hours after it was posted, the social network censured the clip as “sensitive” content.

Results were collated from a survey of  dferent cultures around the globe, published in Current Anthropology. All the cultures agreed the seven behaviours were good but dferent societies had ying opinions of how each of these was prioritised. The rules are: to help your family, help your group,favours, be brave, defer to superiors, ide resources fairly, and respect the property of others. Evidence was analysed by a team from Oxford’s Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, part of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography.   Dr Oliver Scott Curry, lead author and senior researcher at the Institute for Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, said: The debate between moral universalists and moral relativists has raged for centuries, but now we have some answers. People everywhere face a similar set of social problems, and use a similar set of moral rules to solve them. As predicted, these seven moral rules appear to be universal across cultures.  Mr Curry said that everyone, wherever they may be, has a common moral code. He says it is universally agreed that people should cooperate and promote a common good. The research looked into how morality has evolved in order to promote co-operation and mutualism. We value being in groups because theres safety in numbers, it is believed.

He got the wire out of his finger last week.“He can start his comeback proper and he’s keeping Andrew Davies company at the moment – they’ve done a lot together on the bikes and they’re doing running on the training ground so it’s great to see them coming back.”Meanwhile, two bodies he’d like back sooner are nearing aand Jim is hoping he’ll have his striking options boosted for Saturday’s home clash with Hearts.Frontmen Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran missed the - defeat to Rangers last midweek but have a chance of athis week.“They are coming on, slow,” Jim said.“They aren’t back on the training ground yet but we’re hoping we’ll have at least one back training by the end of the week.“Craig had an injection in his stomach last week which has settled down nicely but it needs time.“Nelson is his heel which he picked up celebrating his goal at Livingston.“Again that is better but it’s not fully away yet.“What we don’t want to do is bring him back too early and there is a recurrence.“We’ve tried a couple of dferent things but he was tender last week and we had to back off.“It was better over the weekend so we’ll see what he’s like by the end of the week.”At Ibrox, Jim opted for on-loan forward Scott Wright to lead the line in an attempt to catch Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on the hop with pace and will have that option again. However, he’d welcome goalscorer Nelson and “focal point” Curran back.The Dens gaffer said: “Craig has been a focal point for us and brings a lot of people into play in terms of the work he puts in and how he doesn’t let defenders settle.“We went for pace against Rangers by putting Scott Wright up and pace on the sides with Jesse Curran and Andy Dales.“That wasn’t an easy decision because we had Kenny Miller’s experience there as well but we felt we could get down the sides of them when their full-backs went forward but we met them on a night when they were excellent.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c794433740745.45706646.jpg ","title":"brentford arab to cycle from dundee uniteds tannadice ground to london","story":"A football friendship that kicked off with a chance meeting in a Berlin bar while watching Andy Murray win Wimbledon will see a Brentford fan literally get on his bike at Tannadice today and cycle almost  miles back “home” to the London club’s Grfin Park.In the process, Steve Tidy will take in four games and, most important of all, raise around £, for the Alzheimer’s Trust.The -year-old has travelled north to meet up with good mate Pat McCarron, who’s well-known among Arabs as chairman of the group Fans United, and took in the Scottish Cup clash with Inverness Caley before setting off this morning.And his arduous route south is all down to that friendship.“It was back in  and Brentford were in Berlin for pre-season. Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park. I had actually planned it as a practice run before I cycle from London to Paris and back via Guernsey in the summer, but this might be an even bigger task.“That said, my biggest challenge could be surviving the weekend with Pat before I set off on the bike!”Once he’s on his way, Steve will complete the journey in stages and take in Brentford games at Middlesbrough and Sheffield United before arriving at Grfin Park just in time for the clash with West Brom later this month.And thanks to the support he’s already receiving, he hopes to pass a personal milestone with his fund- raising efforts.“I got into cycling a few years back and I’ve done a charity ride to Amsterdam to raise money. It’s a great way to stay fit and, by the time I’ve completed this journey, I should have raised around £, in all for a few charities, so that’s not bad.“I am loving the support I am getting from all in Dundee. It’s overwhelming how many nice people there are from Dundee to Durham, Hartlepool to Leeds, Sheffield to London.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee schools praised for inclusive attitudes on lgbt issues","story":"The struggle of growing up and getting through school is dficult enough for most teenagers.But for those who fall under the umbrella of LGBTand are battling with their identity, it can be even harder.Research by the charity LGBT Youth Scotlandfound % of LGBT children have suffered bullying in school because of their identity or sexuality.However, Dundee schools are looking to change that with supportive, inclusive environments.At Morgan Academy, pupils have formed their own LGBT group, which meets once a week.Among those attending the group are Aimee Whyte, , and Avery McManus, .Avery, who identies as non-binary , said: “I feel like a lot of people are being told they can’t be non-binary – but we need to break down the barrier of being whatever you identy as.”Aimee said: “People should be able to share this stuff and not be scared to talk about it.“School should be a judgment-free zone and having support gives you confidence.”Both said they had faced dficulties because of their identity, but they, and other LGBT pupils, have the backing of staff and the school captains and prefects – and these efforts have been recognised.Morgan Academy and Dundee City Council’s children and family services team have each been given LGBT Youth Scotland’s LGBT Charter Award.It recognises their proven commitment to give LGBT people the right to be healthy and heard.Stewart Hunter, children and family services convener, said: “Young people get this more than we do. Back when I was at school, this wasn’t something that was spoken about.“It’s not that it didn’t exist, but it was hidden. But now staff want to understand it and the award recognises the good work schools are doing.”Deputy convener Roisin Smith added: “We’re having these conversations that need to be had to ensure we achieve the goal of inclusion no matter how you identy.”The children and families service has been recognised for its efforts to include LGBT themes in lessons. As well as being discussed in social education, LGBT figures routinely feature in history lessons and same-sex couples are used in maths questions.Jenner King, the council’s education manager for inclusion, said: “We recognise that young people’s ersity and identity need to be respected and celebrated.”It is not the first step Dundee schools have taken towards inclusion.Downfield Primary was given the charter award last year, while measures such as gender-neutral washrooms have been put in place at schools, including Harris Academy.The latter has led to an outcry among women’s groups who say it leaves girls vulnerable, but Mr Hunter says such opinions fail to consider the views of the pupils themselves.He said: “The kids are comfortable with it.“My son is a pupil at Harris and there’s no issue.”Barry Jordan, LGBTYS Tayside development officer, said: “I have been doing this job for seven years and even in that time there has been a huge change in Dundee.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee skipper martin woods says side need to keep their heads to avoid relegation","story":"Martin Woods says Dundee need to keep their heads in the “crazy” Premiership run-in as they attempt to battle their way to safety.The Dark Blues dropped back into the relegation play-off place after a -

but it’s a crazy league.“Weeks ago, nobody would have seen us going to Tynecastle and getting a result so there will be ups and downs and we have to stick together.“We’ve looked through the Rangers game and seen what we can do better defensively as a team and take that on to the next bunch of games to get some points on the board.”With no match over the weekend due to the Scottish Cup taking priority, it’s been a welcome break for the Dark Blues after a couple punishing results.Woods hopes the breather will allow them to up their game when Hearts come calling on Saturday.“I think it’s been a tough run of games so it’s been good to sit back, reflect and get ready to go again,” he added.“We’ll work on a few things in the training ground and take it into the next bunch of games which are going to be vital.“We have a couple of tough ones coming up with Hearts at home, which we hope to get something out of, and then Celtic at home will be a day we have to be disciplined and get off to a lot better start than we did at Rangers.”If they keep their discipline and manage to up their level from the first half at Ibrox, Woods is confident their luck will turn to help them make it two wins in a row against Hearts, after their - victory at Tynecastle in January.He added: “Against Livingston, they went down to  men, we got a goal in the last seven minutes, we could’ve had a penalty against us so we’ll get days where things go for you.“That’s probably two in a row where nothing’s gone for us at all against Hibs and Rangers.“There will be loads of twists and turns before now and the end of the season, we just need to focus on our performance levels and try to keep that high.“We dropped in the first half against Rangers which wasn’t great but that was a mixture of both them being really good and us not doing as well as we could.“The first goal from a set-piece, we weren’t tight enough and got punished.“From there you could see them get a lt and that’s an important thing to do at Ibrox, to start well.“It was very frustrating but we’ll not be judged by games like away at Ibrox, there will be a lot of big games to come before now and the end of the season.”Woods is also keen to repay the club’s support that has been starved of home success this season with the number of home wins the worst in the ision.“The fans have stuck with us and they were brilliant against Hibs.“I think they can see the performance level has been better in recent weeks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ewan gurr living wage is good business for both employers and employees","story":"The Eveningreported last week that some firms interested in opening retail outlets on our city’s Waterfront may be deterred due to the requirement to pay a real living wage of £ per hour to employees.Before his retirement last September, I spoke to Mike Galloway, Dundee City Council’s then executive director of city development, who was responsible for the measure.Mike grew up in a working-class community in Glasgow and said his parents worked in the hotel industry at a time when it generated a sustainable income.Therefore he wanted to ensure young new entrants would also receive a fair wage.I asked Mikehe had experienced any resistance and he told me about one business, whose name I will not reveal, which traditionally paid the minimum wage where.Mike refused to budge and the employer agreed that all staff would be paid the real living wage.One month later, the employer came back to him and said an analysis of staff morale had shown higher results in Dundee than any other site and the company was now considering rolling out the real living wage to other sites.A living wage is just good business – good for the employer and good for the employee."},{"url":null,"title":"female icons whose names could feature on fleet of city buses","story":"BUS firm Xplore Dundee is set to name its latest fleet of buses after some of the city’s most inspirational women – and needs the public’s help to make the choice.The firm is launching a new poll this week ahead of International Women’s Day on Friday to name four of the new Emerald buses, which serve the  route.Ten of the buses have already been named by staff – all of them after women either from Dundee or with strong links to the city’s past and present.Seven others are being put to the public vote, with the four with the most votes having their names emblazoned on the new hybrid vehicles.Christine McGlasson, managing director of the firm, said: “There are so many fantastic achievements accomplished throughout history by women from Dundee or with strong links to the city, so we decided this would be a great theme for the naming of our new Emerald buses.“Some of them may be hidden gems, others will be better known, but we think they’re all worthy of pride of place on our new vehicles, and we hope our customers and Eveningreaders will agree.”The seven women the public can vote for, featured below, include those known for their public service, work in the community, contributions to science and campaigning.One of two living women nominated is Debbie Findlay, named Dundee’s Citizen of the Year in .She has dedicated her time to volunteering in foodbanks, helping patients with cancer and organising tea dances for the city’s older people.

season and saw at close quarters what Considine brings to the Reds.The -year-old is in his th season with the Dons, but his contract is up in the summer.Discussions have taken place about a new deal, but no extension has been signed yet. Having played with and against Considine, Quinn thinks keeping him would be good business for Aberdeen.The former Motherwell, Cardf and Ross County centre-back said: “Aberdeen as a club will always have to sign players from England or from where in Scotland.“But it is still very important to have people from the area who have come through the ranks, know what it’s about and know the pressure of playing for the club.“The Andy Considines and Graeme Shinnies are those players. Andy has been a great servant to Aberdeen, I played with Andy for a period in my career and I’ve known him for a long time.“We were in Scotland age group squads and I’ve played against and with him over a near -year period.“I have seen how consistent he is and along with that he is a top fella and a great guy in the dressing room.”Club captain Graeme Shinnie, pictured below, is also out of contract at the end of the season.The Dons skipper is currently deliberating his future with plenty of interest in him from English Championship clubs.Quinn, who has started his own business during a break from the game after leaving Dundee United last summer. believes it may be tougher for Aberdeen to keep Shinnie.The -year-old added: “Graeme is similar to Andy in knowing what the club is about but it might be dficult for Aberdeen to keep hold of him. He is a player that I think just keep getting better and contributing more for Aberdeen.“He has got a decision to make but it might be tricky for Aberdeen to keep him because he could play at a higher level.“In Scotland the only higher level in the last few years has been Celtic. Whether Graeme would end up there I don’t know.“But it may be down south where I think there will be big clubs in the English Championship interested in Graeme. I know Aberdeen fans won’t like me saying that, but when you have his ability there will be interest.”On Saturday Aberdeen travel to Parkhead looking to set a club record of eight straight away wins, then on Tuesday they face Rangers at Ibrox in the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay.Under manager Derek McInnes the Dons have shown they are more than capable of beating the Glasgow giants on their own patch.Quinn believes the Reds competing with Celtic and Rangers for honours and beating them away from home is down to the job done by McInnes.He said: “His budgets aren’t as strong as Celtic or Rangers, but he keeps doing it.“He loses good players, but he always manages to bring in good players.“Derek is a top manager working at a top club and with the job he has done I am slightly surprised that he is still there.“But he has built something at Aberdeen and will feel he still has unfinished business and more to achieve at Aberdeen.”Meanwhile, the Dons are set to receive fewer than , tickets for next week’s Scottish Cup replay with Rangers at Ibrox.Competition regulations state the Red Army would be entitled to up to % of the Glasgow ground’s capacity, which would be closer to , briefs.However, it is understood Aberdeen will receive the same amount –  tickets – as they did for the -

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drongan man 28 snared having","story":"NewsDrongan man, , snared for having sexual relations with -year-old girlSick Samuel Davidson, of Watson Terrace in Drongan, was caught out when officers found the teen in his bedroom on May , .ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsDavidson admitted engaging in sexual activity with the girl\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old man was snared for having sexual relations with a -year-old girl after her parents filed a missing persons report.

The pair agreed to go to Davidson’s house where they watched a film together before the girl’s friend left them alone.

The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14081860.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_JS176629794.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there.

No concrete dates have been set as the event is still being finalised. However, local people and businesses are encouraged to get involved to help promote Hoggrsquos Borders legacy.Internationally, the anniversary will be celebrated in Washington DC.Enthusiasts can attend an event held in the Library of Congress where they will be talking about Hoggrsquos le and Borderrsquos traditions.Stirling University is known as the world centre of Hoggs work.And they are currently doing a project to collect all the poets work and republish it. So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to honour the literary great.If you would like to get involved or find out any more information, then contact Dr Adrian Hunter at adrian.hunter@stir.ac.uk or EYCDC Vicky Davidson at

Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

People pick up dferent ideas from other peoplersquos weddings and events in other parts of the world and then they want that for themselves. Itrsquos an aspiration thing and the Internet has a lot to play, making people more educated, savvy and know what they want. Because of this, people think out the box and are able to put their own personal touch on the wedding to make it unique.Thinking outside the box is definitely what Hassanrsquos clients do well. The biggest wedding he has planned in his career involved a dizzying , guests. With clients more cost-savvy now, he describes how over-the-top ideas from couples are never far.ldquoThe craziest idea wersquove had was when a couple wanted , flowers hung from the ceiling two years ago, Hassan remembers, amused. ldquoIn big spaces like conference rooms, it softens the space, but these things are expensive - particularly with fresh flowers - so we then have to look at the next best thing, how we can achieve it, how it can be set up. We would then have to work with other professionals who can work at heights.In the first episode, we get to see a wedding being put together in the cityrsquos Crowne Plaza as Hassan and his staff scramble to hang hundreds of flowers from the ceiling, albeit fake ones.He explains: ldquoFresh flowers are obscene and not everyone can afford it, so we then look at articial flowers, which look just as real. For the sake of a few hours, they want it to look good, obviously.What is it about weddings that have Asian families going over-the top ldquoPakistanis are not that extravagant in their day-to-day lives, but a wedding is when theyrsquoll either be welcoming a new addition to the family or giving their daughter away, so theyrsquoll spend the most, says Hassan.ldquoWith pound, budgets, you have to take everything into consideration, including clothes and jewellery, which are a big expense. Clients travel to Pakistan and India to get their shopping done. Remember, Asian weddings can last for days as well. Some families will put marquees up at home and host pre-wedding events where the whole family comes together. It does add up to quite a lot of money, but the Bank of Mum and Dad can help out. Though, these days, professional couples themselves are very much in control and can pay everything themselves. Many live with their parents so they have that additional income saved up, he adds.Viewers will get to see a Falkirk mum planning a joint walima for her two sons in episode one as Hassanrsquos clients work on ways to cut down costs.Hassan says: ldquoSome will realise itrsquos too extravagant and theyrsquoll decide to put money into a house instead. But, nowadays, clients will cut down on the number of events they have and just roll it all into one day to cut down on costs.Working with demanding clients and large families comes with its tribulations. Hassan says: ldquoWhen yoursquore working with two families trying to create one event, sometimes it gels really well and other times itrsquos the opposite and you get friction. Usually, one family will sit back and let the other take control. If both families have dferent views, they can clash. Irsquove had that before and it does get tricky. Wersquove witnessed barnies happening right in front of us and it can get awkward, but itrsquos just about stepping in and mediating.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-snp-wants-to-make-scotland-the-best-country-in-which-to-live-and-work","story":"Last week marked a number of important milestones towards Scotland becoming a fairer country ndash which is a key objective of the SNP Scottish Government.:Hiring declines at its fastest pace in seven years as Brexit concerns continueOne of those milestones was the publication of our Fair Work Action Plan.The SNP wants to make Scotland be the best country in which to live, work, invest and do business. At the heart of this ambition lies our commitment to fair work.For employees fair work means decent wages, secure contracts and just working practices. Fair work is not only right in principle, it also results in better health and greater wellbeing for workers. In turn this drives creativity, innovation and productivity. It also reduces staff turnover, which means increased profitability for businesses.With employment reserved to Westminster, Scotland does not yet have the powers to make fair work a legal requirement, but that doesnrsquot stop us from taking as much action as we can to encourage fair work practices.For years the Scottish Government has championed good employment practices through schemes such as the Scottish Business Pledge and Living Wage accreditation, and we are now strides ahead of the rest of the UK in many areas.There are now , accredited Living Wage Employers in Scotland. We also have a higher proportion of employees paid at least the real living wage than any other UK nation. We have gone further than any other part of the UK to help eradicate blacklisting from public contracts, and we have ensured that no person directly employed by the Scottish Government is on an exploitative zero hours contract.:Scottish and Welsh parliaments to vote on Brexit oppositionItrsquos great progress and we want to do even more to support workers and businesses across the country, which is why we have been working with the Fair Work Convention and the Scottish Trades Union Congress on the Fair Work Action Plan.The plan sets out a range of new measures to embed good practice, with tailored approaches to meet the needs of inidual businesses.It includes setting up a new Fair Work service for small and micro employers, a new target of increasing the number of employees paid the real living wage by , over the next three years, a revamp of the Scottish Business Pledge to fully align it with fair work practices, and a learning network to better support businesses who want to sign up and meet these objectives.Wersquore working hand in hand with unions and employers to put fair work first in a truly meaningful way. This is an approach that is good for workers, good for businesses and good for Scotland as a whole, and that is why wersquore so determined to lead by example.Ultimately, for as long as employment law is reserved to Westminster the Scottish Governmentrsquos ability to eradicate unfair working practices will be limited, but that wonrsquot stop us acting where we can.Another area which remains substantially reserved to Westminster, but where some new powers are nevertheless allowing us to take a dramatically dferent approach to the rest of the UK is social security.:Scotland best part of UK for workplace gender ersitySince the Social Security Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament last year, we have been able to improve the lives of thousands of people across the whole of Scotland.We have delivered the Carersrsquo Allowance Supplement, paying out more than pound million to over , carers. Wersquove also put pound. million into the pockets of more than , families in Scotland through the new Best Start Grant. In fact since our new agency, Social Security Scotland first opened its doors, we have paid out an additional pound million to people across the country.

How did she become so powerful when her fractured memories also paint her as a fallen fighter pilot and a plucky child racer  In struggling to understand herself, however, Marvel ndash aka Carol Danversndash also finds herself involved in a war between two alien civilizations, the Krees and the Skrulls, which eventually brings her to Earth in  and into an unlikely alliance with SHIELDrsquos Nick Fury .The ensuing adventure establishes Danvers as a kick-ass heroine who likes to have fun, as well as one of lersquos battlers.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Wednesday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Businesses in Thurso urged to work together to help develop tourism","story":"BUSINESSES must work together to help develop tourism in Thurso.That was the key message from a meeting attended by more than  people representing ious aspects of the industry, including accommodation, tours, transport and town centre shops.They met on Friday to discuss the Destination Thurso project which is being run by Thurso Community Development Trust .Last year, it conducted a community consultation which found development of tourism in the town was a priority need.The trust has since secured funding from Highland Leader and the Caithness and North Sutherland Fund to run its Destination Thurso project which employs a tourism development officer to oversee a project that will create a website, associated social media, workshops and a tourism development plan.Helen Allan, vice-chairperson of the trust, said: ldquoWe had a strong iety of dferent tourism businesses and organisations attending the meeting.ldquoI think sometimes it might be thought that tourism is only reliant on accommodation providers but that isnrsquot strictly true ndash visitors come into contact with a wide iety of services when coming to our town, from taxi drivers to town centre shops.

It’s perhaps no surprise that the transport secretary refused to say he had confidence in HIAL’s management the last time I asked him.

Speaking on behalf of the four Scottish Health charities, Angela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland said: “It’s less than four weeks until March  and people are telling us how anxious and concerned they are about the lack of clarity and detail.#As leading patient voice charities, representing hundreds of thousands of people, we have a responsibility to articulate the very real worries and fears many have about the supply, distribution and storage of medicines in a no deal Brexit.“Insulin, for example, is a daily le-saving necessity for thousands of people with diabetes, and any delay or interruption to access would be incredibly dangerous.“Anti-epileptic drugs are also a daily necessity for people with epilepsy.#Any delay or change in the makeup of the drugmight trigger seizures in someone whose condition has been well-managed for many years with no guarantee they will be seizure free again.#Additionally, emergency rescue medication, like midazolam, is a vital lesaving drug for people with dficult to manage epilepsy. Any interruption to supply raises serious concern and may result in avoidable deaths.“There are many other drugs and medical supplies which are equally critical to health.“We are urgently calling on the Scottish Government to produce the detail required to reassure the Scottish public that all relevant organisations involved in the supply, storage and local distribution of medicines in Scotland, have robust systems and agreements in place.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Given that controllers have now voted to go on strike, it would appear that the problems extend more widely than just centralisation.“Given the leline nature of our air services, the impact that industrial action will have on those services must be taken extremely seriously.

From isles patients attending hospital appointments to local businesses trying to remain competitive, these services are a genuine leline.“Even at this late stage, we would urge HIAL and the unions to get back round the table and resolve this dispute.  Ministers must also do everything possible to help broker a resolution and avoid the massive disruption any airport closures would inevitably cause.#Following Friday#s announcement from the Prospect union, that air traffic controllers under their membership had voted to undertake industrial action, HIAL said, as a government-sponsored agency, they had to follow the Scottish Government pay policy, and could not implement pay awards more than that directed by the government.A Scottish Government spokesman has since weighed in on the situation, saying: “HIAL has implemented a pay rise for all staff, which is a signicant improvement on previous years, as well as signicantly increasing their contribution to their pension scheme in order to maintain this benefit for employees. Staff also continue to receive generous annual leave, sick pay and other allowances.“In the face of the UK Government’s continued budget cuts, the Scottish Government delivered a distinctive and progressive Pay Policy for   — one which is fair, supports those on lower incomes and protects public sector jobs and services while delivering value for money for the people of Scotland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Let’s never forget that. And this project continues to protect us today,” he wrote.The EU, he stressed, was a bastion against “aggressive strategies by the major powers” – he didn’t name any countries but the leading candidates would be Russia, China and, possibly, Donald Trump’s America.: Brexit: Macron calls Brexiteers ‘anger-mongers’ and liarsAnd it was also large enough to take on the new-found dominance of “digital giants” and to protect people from the “crises of financial capitalism”. The aim of his letter was not to lambast the Brexiteers, though he used them as an example of anti-immigration, right-wing populists who are expected to make gains in the forthcoming European elections.Their vision was one of “rejection without an alternative. And this is the trap that threatens the whole of Europe: the anger mongers, backed by fake news, promise anything and everything.”The EU was about ensuring “democratic freedom: the freedom to choose our leaders as foreign powers seek to influence our votes at every election”.There is little doubt he was talking about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Both Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as US President have suited the Kremlin’s main foreign policy aim of undermining Western democracies by sowing the seeds of ision among them.The EU is not without its faults and Brexit still seems likely to happen. But, whatever occurs, the UK must always remember that our true friends are fellow democracies like Macron’s France. We must keep them close and resist the likely efforts to drive us further apart. Because Macron may not have been exaggerating when he said: “Never since the Second World War has Europe been so essential. Never has Europe been in such danger.”: Brexit: MSPs demand Theresa May takes no-deal off the table©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kezia dugdale accuses scottish labour leader of censorship","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The former leader of Scottish Labour, Kezia Dugdale, has accused her successor of censoring and insulting the party#s two Scottish members of the European Parliament.In a heated letter to Richard Leonard, Ms Dugdale says she was “shocked” to discover he had intervened in a statement from Catherine Stihler in the party’s guide to its annual conference due to be held this weekend.She claims that on the instruction of Mr Leonard, and without Ms Stihler’s consent, a description of Brexit being “a tragedy for our country” and her support for a second referendum had been deleted.: SNP MP defends Richard Leonard over ‘mind-numbing’ place of birth claimMs Dugdale also expressed her disappointment in Mr Leonard’s own position on Brexit.He said last week he would rather have a Labour deal to leave the EU than a second vote.And Ms Dugdale said it was an insult the combined  years of service from Ms Stihler and David Martin would not be recognised at the conference in Dundee.It is believed Ms Dugdale shared her letter to Mr Leonard with her party’s MSPs in Holyrood.A Labour source said: “Kezia felt it was important that all elected members should know that their words can be changed and printed without their permission.”In her letter to Mr Leonard, she writes: “I wish to formally complain about the way in which Catherine Stihler and David Martin have been treated ahead of conference.“From what I can see from the agenda, there is no formal opportunity for them to speak or indeed a formal item to thank them for their combined  years of electoral service to the party.“If that wasn’t bad enough, I was shocked to discover from Catherine that her statement in the conference guide had been amended without her consent.“When that was challenged, she was told it was on your direction and that you had the final say on what was printed.”: Scottish Labour donations dry up as party battles splits, BrexitThe letter repeats the deleted section, which states: “Brexit is a tragedy for our country and for the workers and communities that Labour represents. That’s why David and Catherine fully support a People’s Vote with the option to remain in the EU.”This section was replaced with: “The complete mess the Tories have made of Brexit means they are putting Scottish people’s jobs and our industries at risk. Labour will always put them first.”Ms Dugdale said: “I find that wholly inappropriate and I can’t possibly understand why you would seek to censor her final words to party members, especially since what she states is party policy and has been since last September.“Can I encourage you to please take urgent steps to recty what I consider to be a considerable insultand ensure that we thank these two outstanding MEPs properly at conference.”Scottish Labour was approached for comment.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"rbs building at gogarburn reopened following suspicious package alert","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The RBS building at Gogarburn in Edinburgh has been reopened following a report of a #suspicious package#.The building was evacuated after police were called around :am today, however, an investigation found the package posed no risk and only contained promotional goods. \u2028window.twttr The area surrounding the site has now been reopened.Edinburgh Police tweeted: “Inquiries have established that the package posed no risk to the public and contained promotional goods. “The area surrounding the building has been reopened and the public are thanked for their patience whilst this incident was ongoing.”\u2028Earlier today, Glasgow University was also evacuated after a suspicious package was found.

How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me.

I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/001WH2202NCA-cropped.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"picture update royal visitors join children at surestart scheme","story":"Continuing their journey through Northern Ireland William and Kate chat with children and parents from the St Joseph#s Surestart in Ballymena window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringThursday  February  :Picture DeskPictures: Aaron McCrackenDuchess of Cambridge meets parents and children at St Josephs Surestart in Ballymena today.

Likewise, the countdown to Cheltenham begins in earnest for local punters after the hugely-popular Sean Graham preview night at Belfast’s Europa Hotel.This year’s top table included the top trainer from last year’s Festival Gordon Elliott along with David Casey, assistant trainer to his rival Willie Mullins.Noel Meade’s stable jockey Sean Flanagan joined the line up along with Mark ‘The Couch’ Winstanley , Richard Hoiles , Gary O’Brienwhile Bookmakers Brian and Ronan Grahamwere on hand to provide the latest odds and give their insights.If the  of experts are to believed, Clan Des Obeaux, an impressive winner of the King George, won’t be winning this year’s Gold Cup, or any other Gold Cup for that matter.Last year’s RSA Chase hero Presenting Percy was the almost unanimous selection from the top table. There was a good each-way shout for Elliott’s Shattered Love , but the Co Meath trainer insisted he’d love to be training Presenting Percy. David Casey was keen on whatever Mullins aims at the race , but cautioned that he wouldn’t back last year’s winner Native River “with stolen money” following his below-par efforts this season.Elliott appears to have great chance of landing the feature on Day One with the brilliant mare Apple’s Jade.Without giving too much away, he added that he “couldn’t be happier” with Apple’s Jade, who is four from four this season.Defending champion Buveur D’Air was friendless at the top table while Casey reported Laurina to be in rude health, but stressed that she would need to improve on her form having won a weak Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle in .Brain Graham feels the seven-pound Mare’s allowance will be a key factor and thinks Apple’s Jade will prevail.Altior , unsurprisingly, was an almost universal tip to retain the Champion Chase with only Winstanley opting for second-favourite Min .If Buveur D’Air was largely opposed by the  in the Champion Hurdle, Stayers’ Hurdle ante-post favourite Paisley Parkwas described as the lay of the meeting by bookmaker Ronan Graham.The  seemed keen to take on the favourite with the reliable Supasundaeand Faugheen .

Money is also invested in firms linked to fracking and alcohol.Read MoreJohn Simpson: Members must push management for an ethical and social investment policyIn some cases, shareholdings appear to directly conflict with some of the members core aims.For example, the decision to invest tens of millions in tobacco companies may sit uncomfortably with staff at the Northern Ireland Hospice, who are members of the scheme.The hospice said it had not been told of the investment.The scheme is managed by the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers Superannuation Committee .Comprising around half the public sector workforce - including councillors, teachers and the Fire and Rescue Service - it manages the pensions for , people across around  organisations.NILGOSC said its main duty is to act in the best interests of the scheme beneficiaries.Analysis of the committees equity holdings shows investments totalling more than £. billion in around  companies. The investments range from £m in Amazon to £, in Ecosynthetix, a renewable chemicals company. A further £bn is tied up in pooled funds.However, some of the investments will be controversial.NILGOSC has pumped £.m into British American Tobacco, the international company behind Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes, with a further £.m going to Philip Morris International, which makes Marlboro and other leading brands.The hospice, whose members pensions are looked after by NILGOSC, said \"there has been no communication from NILGOSC regarding where they invest their funds\".The fund also invests in some multinational companies with interests in shale gas exploration.Its holdings include energy giants BP , gas firm Centrica , mining firms Rio Tintoand BHP Billiton , and oil company Exxon Mobil .Local environmentalists called on NILGOSC to take its money out of these firms.Green Party Ards and North Down councillor Rachel Woods has her pension managed by NILGOSC. She said having it invested with companies exacerbating climate breakdown is disturbing.Ms Woods said: \"Weve been lobbying for pensions scheme managers to end their involvement with fossil fuel industries for some time. Ive also met with trade unions to discuss this matter. Workers should have full disclosure and be given a say on how their pensions are invested.\"Friends of the Earths James Orr said NILGOSC \"will be on the wrong side of history\"it does not est from the fossil fuels industry.In the  months to March  last year, NILGOSC had holdings worth £.m in Britains biggest arms company BAE Systems, which has provided equipment to the United States for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Meanwhile, two of the worlds biggest aerospace and defence firms, which have produced technology used in the Syria conflict, are on the NILGOSC list.Lockheed Martin, which makes guided missiles, rockets and fighter jets, has received £.m, while Northrop Grumman, which builds bombers and drones, received £.m.Some £.m is invested in missile and weapons manufacturer Boeing, while Rolls Royce, which produces military aircraft engines, has also received investments totalling £.m.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade says public money should be invested in the public good and not to boost arms companies which fuel and profit from war and conflict.\"Local authorities should strive to have a positive global footprint and lead by example. NILGOSC should end these investments and instead set a positive precedent by adopting an ethical investment policy,\" he added.Around £.m is invested in Diageo, a leading producer of spirits and beer, and £.m in Heineken.Among the top  international firms the fund invests in are Amazon , Facebook , Netflixand Google parent company Alphabet , which is worth a combined £m.Several of these companies have come under fire over how much tax they pay in the UK.NILGOSC said: \"NILGOSCs overriding obligation is to act in the best interests of the scheme beneficiaries.\"It said the body invests in a wide range of asset types across the world and appoints fund managers who select the stocks for their particular mandate.It added the fund is currently invested in, locally and globally, manufacturers of electric vehicles, wind power, solar power, hydropower, biomass and energy conservation.It said: \"NILGOSC has instructed its active fund managers to take account of environmental, social and corporate governanceconsiderations provided the primary financial obligation is not compromised and will ensure that the fund managers it appoints are capable of appropriately considering ESG issues when making investment choices.\"NILGOSC shares concerns over climate change and carbon issues and works at both a fund and an industry level to further climate action.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier. Russell Brothers also had another great season winning the highly prized McBride Cup for the channel averages plus winning Penzance Classic.C  L Fryers had the first bird from Dromara in the Kingrsquos Cup. McKinstry Brothers had some great results along with T Marshall  Son, first bird in Penzance Young Bird, D McCandless Yearling National winner.Mr  Mrs Stevenson again did well inland as well as beating the big boys on the channel by winning first Tallbenny.H Silcock had some great positions and were unlucky to be fourth open Friendship National and still be only second in the club.After the prizes and trophies were handed out Mrs Rooney presented Fiona Stevenson with a bouquet of flowers mdash a small token of thanks for the hospitality from her and Bobby throughout the year.As usual, the highlight of the evening was the ballot and with Stanley McKinstry not attending this year his luck was taken up by Fiona Stevenson.In fact they won so many young birds Bobby thought he might not even have to breed any of his own. N Edgar  Son and N Black  Son kindly donated two young birds each.Edgarrsquos two were won by new member Chris Rooney and Mr  Mrs Stevenson and Blackrsquos two young birds were won by Gordon Kirkpatrick and Mr  Mrs Stevenson.C  l Fryersrsquo young bird was won by non-fancier William Skelly, who is putting it into the stable of N Black  Son to be raced.Cromie  Magee and Sonsrsquo was won by Russell Bros, Mr  Mrs Stevensonrsquos by Chris Rooney, Russell Bros by H Silcock, T Marshall  Sonrsquos by Mr  Mrs Stevenson and A Bradleyrsquos was won by P Connor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Conal Montgomery samples new sound  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH rocker Conal Montgomery is working on new original music for the first time in years.The well-known singer who has performed at bikersrsquo rallies and conventions around the UK for the last  years may surprise some of his fans with his new sound.Instead of the soaring progressive rock vocals he is known for, Conalrsquos new music is softer, more reflective folk style.The  year-old says that his new music is indicative of where he is in his personal le now.The  year-old explained: ldquoI havenrsquot felt like this for years particularly as when I was drinking I really couldnrsquot be bothered with writing music.ldquoI wrote songs in the early s but alcohol and drugs just took over my le and my time was wasted.ldquoFor  odd years I didnrsquot do anything and now that Irsquom sober, I just have a love for it. I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child. No child will be disadvantaged or be selected to attend this new school. For once they will have control over their choice of post-primary education.ldquoWhat is proposed is a Catholic school, with a strong Catholic Lasallian ethos. No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of.

Setting out a novel philosophy of accountability for public servants in a democracy, the secretary of state made a series of remarkable statements to a near-empty House of Commons chamber.Her comments came as she rushed through Parliament in a single day a crucial piece of budgetary legislation which authorised billions of pounds of public spending in Northern Ireland.She did so on the basis that it had only recently become clear now – three weeks from the end of the financial year – that there would be no devolved Executive to do so, even though for months there have not even been talks to restore Stormont.Ms Bradley repeatedly said that “this is a very technical bill” – before going on to justy giving it less scrutiny despite its complexity.Under cross-party pressure to explain why she had fast-tracked the legislation so that it would receive scant scrutiny by MPs, Ms Bradley offered a series of justications.Having decided not to implement direct rule, she cannot direct how the money is spent. However, she went so far as to tell the Commons that she cannot even ask Stormont civil servants how they are spending the money.Ms Bradley told Labour’s Vernon Coaker: “Those are the monies that the permanent secretaries have asked me to deliver to them.“I cannot direct the spending within those departments. I also cannot ask them exactly which work streams or programmes they will spend the money on, because in this House we do not have the Executive power to do that.”Mr Coaker said that “it would be helpful, as far as possible, to have some idea about the reasons that that money has been requested”.The bill would give retrospective authorisation for money already spent by Stormont during the current financial year. However, it also gives authorisation for the expenditure next year of % of this year’s budget – a huge increase from the % figure in previous such bills.Despite the fact that the first clause of the bill authorised the spending of £. billion, Ms Bradley repeatedly justied the limited scrutiny being given to it. Facing criticism from former Stormont finance minister Sammy Wilson, who said that the scrutiny of the spending was inadequate, Ms Bradley set out her thinking on how civil servants should operate in the current situation.She said: “Civil servants are taking decisions – not major policy decisions, but the decisions that the Northern IrelandAct  enables them to make and that we want them to be able to make.

It is the political decisions that need scrutiny, not the decisions of civil servants. “We would like to see departments given full scrutiny in Stormont, as happens in this House, but we have to be very careful about the constitutional arrangements.”She also told Mr Wilson: “I caution him against trying to create articial scrutiny processes that might well set a precedent for the future across all the devolved nations.”DUP MP Gavin Robinson put it to Ms Bradley: “There is no need for this bill to be done through emergency procedures – there is no need for it to be fast-tracked. “The explanatory memorandum says that the bill is being fast-tracked because there was a hope that the Executive would have been restored to make the provisions. When in the past two months was there any genuine prospect of the Assembly being restored to go through this process ”Ms Bradley replied that “we have to be aware of the constitutional precedents that are set by changing the way we scrutinise these bills”.Ms Bradley appeared to be unclearas to how money has been spent by Stormont.When asked by Labour MP Jess Phillips about expenditure on childcare which was contained within the bill in Ms Bradley’s name, the secretary of state responded obliquely: “I mean, this is a very technical bill to put on a statutory footing the monies that we have already voted through the House or that have been raised locally”, adding that the allocations within it were based on the views of Stormont civil servants.She added: “How they spend that money is for them to determine, based on previous decisions of the Executive and on the previous draft programme for government.”Ms Bradley admitted: “That leads to perverse outcomes”, but insisted thatStormont is not restored there is no other solution. Tory MP Mike Penning said the refusal to implement direct rule was “a sop” to Sinn Fein.DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly put it to Ms Bradley: “At which point will the secretary of state accept that this is an entirely unsustainable position “As has been outlined, there is no scrutiny in this process. I do not believe that such a process would take place anywhere in a democracy in the western world.“This process is taking place completely behind closed doors in terms of what bids are being put forward and what bids are being accepted.”The South Belfast MP, whose husband Richard is permanent secretary of Stormont’s Department of Health, said that “the secretary of state and this government are refusing to put in place direct rule, which, although not desirable, is necessary. We have now had several years of this type of process where there is no scrutiny and no democratic accountability. When is that going to change ”Ms Bradley responded that there was “full scrutiny of the Northern Ireland block grant” – the overall pot of more than £ billion sent to Stormont.However, she admitted that there was an “undesirable level of scrutiny” of how public money is now being spent in Northern Ireland after that point.Ms Bradley sidestepped the DUP MP’s question about direct rule, arguing that the solution to the scrutiny problem was to restore devolution.DUP MP Gregory Campbell said that the NHS in Northern Ireland had come through recent months “in a poor state, but not a crisis” because of the mild winter but warned that next winter he is “absolutely certain we will not come through unscathed” without the Bengoa reforms being implemented either by Stormont or direct rule.Labour MP Stella Creasy and other opponents of Northern Ireland’s abortion and same-sex marriage legislation tabled an amendment to the bill in an attempt to prevent spending enforcing the current law. However, after a warning to Ms Bradley that her concerns would be “perpetual and enduring for every piece of legislation until these issues are resolved”, Ms Creasy withdrew the amendment.DUP MP Sammy Wilson described the NIO as “the nest of vipers” and suggested that it may be NIO advice which is preventing Ms Bradley from moving to direct rule. Labour shadow secretary of state Tony Lloyd said: “I deplore those remarks”, because officials cannot defend themselves.After less than four hours of debate in a near-empty chamber, the Northern Ireland Budget Bill passed all its House of Commons stages and now goes to the Lords.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things N.I. people do better than the English, Scottish and WelshRoad reopens after collisionMomo contacts N.I. man -

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Oxford Island is a great asset to the council area but currently is a bit of a ‘hotch potch’.He said the aim of the masterplan is to get direction on how to build on Oxford Island’s popularity.“It is about branding it and bringing it together,” he said.The council has been consulting with key stakeholders to help the development of the facility and services on site for all users.While the public has not been directly ‘consulted’ there has been an online survey with questions asking them for their opinions.Eight questions such as how often do you visit and why, as well as what improvements would you make to Oxford Island form part of the survey. MrHoulihan said: “The overall purpose of the Oxford Island Master Plan is to provide a strategic framework for the sustainable development and management of Oxford Island over the next ten years.”Mr Houlihan explained that currently there is a lot going on in Oxford Island but a ‘hotch potch’.“What we are trying to do is streamline that and give Oxford Island its own identity.“We have the masterplan, we have spoken to councillors, we have spoken to businesses, we have spoken to staff on the site and now we are speaking to the public.”However, Mr Houlihan said the masterplan has not yet been completed: “We haven’t produced the masterplan yet.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down.
